Some had almost no tread left .  Plaster had come away from the walls from ceiling to floor ,  and along the lower part the bared cement ,  originally grey ,  was stained yellow and smelt of urine .  On a patch where the rough surface of brickwork was exposed , someone had vomited , probably a passing drunk whose sense of propriety , demanding privacy , had deterred him from being sick in the street ; or a returning resident who could not wait to <head>climb</head> the few steps to the communal toilet on the first half - landing . The detritus had stuck to the pitted surface in a wide streaky band as it slid lumpily from chest height to the floor .  Judging by the strength or its smell ,  a mixture of beer and fish and chips ,  the vomit was recent .

If the acceleration is healthy ,  the change into the climb can be made normally ;  if the acceleration is slower than normal ,  then of course the climb must be restricted .  At all times the angle of climb and the combination of speed and height must be such that a safe recovery can be made if the launch fails .  When the change in angle is made smoothly , the glider will be <head>climbing</head> at a safe angle and will be able to recover if there is a launch failure at any point . Students used to be told that it was dangerous to steepen the climb below 100 feet .  This made them hold the glider down and often caused overspeeding or even overrunning of the cable or parachute .

With a low - powered winch or tow car ,  the acceleration is far slower and there is plenty of time to get the glider nicely balanced on the wheel so that it leaves the ground with a safe margin of speed .  Again ,  if the acceleration is poor the climb must not be steepened quickly or it will be impossible to recover in time if the launch fails .  The <head>climbing</head> angles for winch or car tow can be similar once the initial climb is over .

If they are recognised ,  there is almost always plenty of time to prevent a stall occurring .  However ,  many inexperienced pilots get so thoroughly engrossed in the thermalling or what is going on elsewhere that they are temporarily switched off to how they are flying .  Perhaps the work - load is high at the time , looking at the map and the ground for possible clues as to where they are , looking for signs of possible lift to <head>climb</head> in , together with all the other little worries involved in a field landing . It is often at these times that the glider becomes stalled without the pilot noticing ,  and then his instincts are bound to be automatic as the nose and wing drops .  If you stall accidentally it is almost always because you are not aware of the low speed ,  etc. and therefore all the training in the world will not prevent you from responding instinctively because you are not at that moment aware that you are stalled .

But it is the glider pilot who literally has the life of the tow pilot in his hands .  Remember ,  do not hold the glider down too close to the ground ,  5 to 10 feet is safer .  Be ready to ease up to stay in position as the tug starts to <head>climb</head> . If you get out of position and if you find yourself too low ,  move up slowly in small steps ,  checking the movement every few feet .  Don't try to move to the correct position too quickly .

Remember ,  thermal soaring is more about staying in the strongest area of lift than flying at an efficient angle of bank ;  it usually pays to turn  steeply ,  as the small turning circle enables you to keep in the narrow cores of strong lift .  If flying across country is not practical and you are local soaring ,  it is better to practise moving from cloud to cloud or thermal to thermal without taking the climbs to any great height .  For example , on a day with a 3000 foot cloud base , <head>climb</head> to 2500 feet on the first climb , then fly off leaving that thermal , using the airbrakes if necessary to come down to try to find another one at 2000 feet . If you are aiming to go back for a landing ,  only stay long enough in that thermal to get properly centred before moving off again down to 1500 feet and starting to look for the next bit of lift .  Bring each search a little lower .

Undaunted ,  he returned a week later and made the first clean ascent .  In fact The Crack is a much more interesting climb than the name would suggest .  At least a third of the route takes the steep open wall to the left of the corner and the climb as a whole demands a wide range of <head>climbing</head> technique . Even the first pitch ,  escaping left from the steep corner ,  demands positive commitment and the ability to confidently tackle technical wall climbing .  The next pitch ,  stepping from the exposed top of the pinnacle block ,  is again a bold exercise ,  one immediately followed by a forced mantleshelf move to gain a horizontal weakness in the smooth wall .

The German Officer was now obviously dead .  There was blood pouring down his face from a head wound ,  he had slipped from his sitting position and was now lying on his side ,  his knees drawn up. A French medic was <head>climbing</head> the grassy bank from the sunken road to look at the Officer as I got the prisoners out of the dug - out and back to their previous positions in the hollow . I was not surprised to learn that the shelling of our positions was not the German guns but the British guns  ( the bastards )  .   I assisted the Frenchman who was tending the wounded before they were carried away .

As we walked on ,  patches of snow laying in the darker areas of the gully grew ever more frequent .  The sun must only be a rare visitor to this mysterious landscape where spring flowers push through the slowly melting ice .  The path through the still narrowing gorge by now had frequent ladders and sometimes chains so we could steady ourselves as we <head>climbed</head> crystal clear waterfalls some stopped in motion , still under the all - encompassing spell of the powerful winter ice . After two miles or so of this beautiful scenery we emerged at the top of the gorge into sunlight again and were greeted by a wonderful expanse of forest .  We followed as easy path through this still spectacular but very different scenery back to the campsite ,  picking up blue then yellow and finally red markers back .

There was one classic occasion when the flare went out at Fawley refinery .  It burned at the top of a 25Oft stack and we tried all sorts of things to get it to light again .  In the end there was only one way of doing it and that was <head>climbing</head> up there with a match and a long piece of wire . A fitter and I went up and did just that .  I would n't do it today .

There are two volcanoes today ,  Eldfell having been created by the 1973 eruption and joining Helgafell to create a twin pair of cones to the south - east of the new town .  Helgafell is a disappointment .  From afar it looks like the classical volcanic cone and it is with a mounting sense of excitement that I <head>climb</head> the last section of loose lava gravel and sharp , welded lava rock . A snow bunting twitters away to my left ,  laughing  as it turns out  at what is about to happen next ,  when I find that the volcanic dish is shallow and filled with grass and wind - blown rubbish .  The view however ,  is spectacular ,  taking in most of the fifteen islands of the Westmann archipelago .

This chain includes Kebnekaise at 2,111 metres ,  the highest mountain in the Scandinavian Arctic .  ( There are higher mountains in southern Norway and in other parts of the Arctic ,  including Iceland .  )  The peak can be <head>climbed</head> as part of Kungsleden , the King 's Route , an excellent if over - populated route and one of the very few waymarked trails in the Arctic . The route starts at Ammarns ,  south of the Circle ,  and traverses the Peljekaise National park .  It skirts the Sareks National park to the east ,  reaches Kebnekaise and ends at Abisko .

Another potential hazard is water .  Ponds or garden pools with steep sides are lethal traps .  Small animals fall in and , despite being able to swim , cannot <head>climb</head> out again . A gently sloping edge or ramp leading into the water is vital if you do not want to endanger the hedgehogs that visit your garden .  What else can you do to help  apart from driving more sensibly ?

Separatists tried unsuccessfully to disrupt a military parade in Lithuania .  Traditional celebrations in Georgia and Armenia were also cancelled .  Mr Roskha said of the trouble in Kishinyev : Several thousand people from the Popular Front and other groups broke through cordons of police and <head>climbed</head> on to the tanks and armoured personnel carriers , waving banners and chanting slogans . When they got through into Lenin Square ,  the leadership of the republic climbed down from their viewing podium and ran off .  The main thing was that the parade by the military vehicles did not take place .

Net interest payments were 69 %  higher than in 1988 ,  and unit labour costs are soaring .  All this means that the investment boom is over .  The Treasury reckons that , after <head>climbing</head> 8.75 % in real terms last year , fixed business investment will fall by 1 % in 1990 . Business failures in England and Wales rose 10 %  last year ,  after falling since 1984 .

As a communist nation that is also part of the third world ,  Cuba finds its economy in double trouble .  Its trade with capitalist countries ,  like that of its Latin American neighbours ,  was squeezed in the mid - 1980s ,  when it had to re - negotiate payments of hard - currency debts .  Its trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe therefore <head>climbed</head> to 85 % of the total . Now their trade organisation ,  Comecon ,  has crumbled .  Last October Mr Castro declared a peacetime special period  a kind of economic state of emergency ,  or survival programme for Cuban socialism .

The circulation continues to <head>climb</head> : in 1990 it was up to 1.1m on weekdays and 1.7m on Sundays . But the amount of paper needed to produce the obese Sunday edition can cost three times its 1.50 cover price .  To prosper ,  the newspaper needs to attract lots of advertising .

But the contamination is local :  beyond 200km  ( 125 miles )  ,  its effects are negligible .  The plume of smoke is safely confined to the lower atmosphere ,  which means that it is soon mixed with fresh air and removed from the sky by rain .  If the smoke had <head>climbed</head> to the upper atmosphere , it could have remained airborne for months , travelling much farther and possibly affecting the world 's weather patterns . The computer model at Britain 's  Meteorological Office predicts that the fires '  effect on this year 's  monsoon will probably not stand out against the monsoon 's  annual variations .  Although more oil is ablaze than was first thought ,  there is less oil at sea .

What was that !
