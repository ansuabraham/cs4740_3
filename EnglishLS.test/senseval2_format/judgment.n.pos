The beauty of the earlier prose is ,  in part ,  a beauty of grace notes ,  the pointing of sentences ,  charged elegance and buoyant ,  intelligent wit .  In Take a girl like you  a great sentence falls like the dew from heaven during one of the scenes in Amis when a terminally drunk man endures a sexual turmoil and fiasco ,  is stunned by a stunning but not very nice girl .  This particular girl , a model , is putting Patrick in his place by going on about cars : Most of my friends have them on the firm , she said , with the sort of lift of the old proud head that he could hardly believe had not accompanied a limiting <head>judgment</head> on Villiers de l'Isle Adam . In Difficulties with girls  there are passages which recall that lift of the old proud head .  In silence ,  the two almost bowed almost stiffly to each other ,  behaving rather like two  well ,  two somethings - or - other ,  thought Patrick .

Even as the BeSHT delighted his listeners  with his pearls of wisdom ,  his stunning turns - of - phrase ,  his aphoristic acuity ,  so Leonard was learning his own ,  parallel metier ;  the butterfly was following him down the hill .  The negative side of all this was ben Eliezer 's  polemics against straight - faced ,  over - serious rabbinism ;  against those whose understanding of God 's  nature was austere and unfatherly ;  those who ,  while seeking to elevate the Most High ,  merely put him out of touch with his own children ;  debarred them from his welcoming presence by a system or learning that became frivolous in its intensity :  not that its perpetrators could be frivolous :  black was their colour ,  even as severity was their posture  as becomes the frozen - in - soul .  For such , God only frowns on the world , and stirs it to <head>judgment</head> ; the butterfly cannot break loose into flight ; it merely expires , as Leonard expressed it , ending its life in three flag - swept days. It was hard for Satan alone to mislead the whole world ,  declared the grandson of the BeSHT ,  Nachman of Bratislava ,  in one of his more caustic diatribes ,  so he appointed rabbis in different locations .  And not only rabbis ,  one might add ,  but priests and nuns ,  monks ,  ministers and bishops !

The purpose of the civil law is to compensate ;  it is the function of the criminal law to punish .  The most likely explanation for the recent record levels of libel awards is that juries have confused these two functions ,  and part of the blame must lie with judges for having failed adequately to explain to juries the purpose of their damages award .  Perhaps it is too much to hope that the Court of Appeal ( in their forthcoming <head>judgment</head> in the Sutcliffe case ) will give definitive guidance on what should be included in the judge 's summing up in a libel trial .

Collapsed bank depositors get first payout From TONY FARAGHER in the Isle of Man SOME 4,000 depositors who lost 42m in one of Britain 's biggest bank crashes are to receive their first interim payment following an 11.7m <head>judgment</head> against fugitive city financier Jim Raper in the Manx Chancery Court yesterday . Barrister David Ashton ,  acting for the liquidators of the Isle of Man Savings and Investment Bank ,  told the court that good news was on the way for the mostly small depositors ,  many of whom lost their life savings when the Douglas - based bank collapsed seven years ago. There is no reason now why there should not be an interim payment made to the unsecured creditors ,  he said .

The appellant appealed on grounds ,  not raised below ,  that the judge had no power under Order 5 ,  rule 5 to entertain an application by the defendant for enforcement against the appellant of the plaintiff 's  judgment against the defendant and that any claim by the defendant against the appellant was statute barred .  Alan Bayliss  ( Chas J Nicholls )  for the appellant ;  Simon Croall  ( Timmis Desai )  for the defendant ;  the plaintiff was not present or represented .  LORD JUSTICE RALPH GIBSON said that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant applied to the court at any time before <head>judgment</head> for an order under Order 5 , rule 5 ( 2 ) appointing the defendant to represent all or any of the members of the management committee . From that fact considerable difficulty had arisen .  If either had applied promptly ,  the appellant would have brought into the action at an earlier stage and the defendant would ,  in all probability ,  have been forced to give consideration then to the making of a claim to contribution in respect of his liability ,  if proved ,  to the plaintiff .

It was no kindness to allow a litigant who was unsuccessful in the trial court to incur costs protesting at that result ,  if the decision was demonstrably correct or ,  as often in matrimonial disputes ,  if there was no right answer and the trial judge must inevitably be the final arbiter .  2 .  Allowing such appeals to proceed caused grave injustice to the successful party , who was denied the benefit of the <head>judgment</head> in his favour , pending the outcome of the appeal , and almost always incurred irrecoverable costs . 3 .  The employment of the resources of the court in hearing such appeals inevitably postponed the hearing of other appeals where there was a real issue to be decided .

By Joanna Coles ADECISION on whether a trainee journalist should be jailed for contempt of court was yesterday adjourned until next month pending a hearing in the House of Lords .  Mr Justice Hoffman said in the High Court that he had decided to suspend <head>judgment</head> until he knew how soon the House of Lords was likely to hear an appeal against an order forcing Mr William Goodwin , aged 23 , who works on the Engineer magazine , to reveal confidential information . After being assured by Mr Geoffrey Robertson ,  QC ,  defending ,  that the appeal process would be dealt with this week ,  he said he had decided to suspend judgment until January 15 .  Earlier yesterday ,  the Court of Appeal refused an application by Mr Goodwin 's  employers ,  the publishers Morgan Grampian ,  to revoke the order forcing him to hand over notes containing confidential financial information concerning a company ,  which cannot be named for legal reasons .

Nor will those investors and depositors who in the mid - 1970s found themselves caught in a hurricane sweeping throught the secondary banking system after the collapse of Gerald Caplan 's  London and County Securities .

STRONG words and a tendency to make unambiguous rulings have epitomised Sir Anthony Barrowclough 's  five - year tenure in the office of Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration .  Popularly known as the Parliamentary Ombudsman ,  Sir Anthony has been surprisingly open about his work given the secrecy that pervades Whitehall .  Firm <head>judgments</head> of the cases he has investigated have often been accompanied by hard - hitting comments about the problems his office has encountered . This is very much a product of his legal background which ,  in a career spanning 40 years as a lawyer ,  has seen him spurn a more lucrative profession to concentrate on the injusticesthat accompany bureaucracies like the Civil Service .  Born in 1924 ,  his ambitions were delayed by the outbreak of the second world war in which he served in the Royal Naval Reserve from 1943 ,  first in Coastal Forces and then on minesweepers ,  rising to the rank of lieutenant before being demobilised three years later .

This survey has shown that ,  generally speaking ,  the existing range of offences seems to emphasize the result ,  the degree of foresight and the status of the victim as the critical issues in grading crimes of physical violation .  The crimes in the 1861 Act form a somewhat shakily constructed ladder ,  with rather more overlapping of offences and elements of constructive liability than is necessary .  Factors which undoubtedly influence <head>judgments</head> of seriousness , such as the existence of provocation , or the difference between premeditated and impulsive violence , are accorded no legal significance and are left to the sentencing stage . The main exception to this concerns the status of the victim ,  with separate offences for assaults on police - officers and wilful neglect of children ,  for example .  How might the non - fatal offences be reformed so as to conform with the principle of fair labelling ?

With this in mind ,  he is painting a picture of the disaster that would follow if either of the two main parties formed a minority government without a firm agreement with the Liberal Democrats .  The price of such an agreement ,  of course ,  would be electoral reform  which ,  purely incidentally ,  would give his party the balance of power after any election in the foreseeable future .  The outlook for both the economy and for government finances , in Mr Ashdown 's <head>judgment</head> , is dire in fact , it is likely to prove immeasurably worse than either Conservatives or Labour have realised . Although he would not care to make predictions ,  it is not unlikely that the other side of the election ,  particularly in the case of Labour ,  we will have to take some very ,  very tough action indeed  not the least of which will include raising interest rates .  True ,  there are no signs that either Mr Major or Mr Kinnock would contemplate a coalition .
