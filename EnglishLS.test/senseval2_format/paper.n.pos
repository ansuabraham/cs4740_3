Her college library has interesting books ,  as well as the latest art magazines .  Her course teacher has given her a reading list ,  and the library staff are good at helping students with all sorts of interests .  As part of the course , she has to choose a subject of her own about which to write a <head>paper</head> ; one of her difficulties is to know how to form her own views , not just copy already received opinions . She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ;  it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic ,  since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome ,  and although there were plenty of books about it ,  many of them went into extravagant detail .  Happily her supervisor has guided more than one student through topics about Michelangelo ,  and has a route map prepared ,  including introductory and background books ,  but also passages from longer scholarly works .

He is the first of a long line of distinguished French portrait sculptors .  Without comparative material ,  the reader is in serious difficulty about knowing whether to agree with this three - way discriminative judgement .  Gombrich 's scholarly work includes many <head>papers</head> on meaning and interpretation in the visual arts , so that the broad but thin scope of his story of art is instructive ; by writing a survey he inevitably limited himself to a narrow range of comment . His book stresses the history of styles ,  which he describes in sequence ,  Baroque for example being followed by Rococo ,  and Neo - classicism .  An unwary reader might think that the book is a history of the changes in Western art ,  whereas it is in fact only a selection of some changes .

A solo exhibition can vary in scope from the minimum ,  that is to say a show of recent work ,  through a more extended selection to the apogee of a retrospective exhibition .  We have already looked at writing in catalogues ,  and can now turn our attention to the critical responses which appear in articles .  The scope or character of a piece of criticism is naturally related to the magazine or newspaper in which it appears , as we noticed in the case of Dore Ashton 's dismissal from the New York Times because it was asserted that her work could not be understood by the <head>paper</head> 's readers . The first rule for a reader of articles is thus to find a sympathetic publication .  Some trial and error should eliminate the laziest papers ,  whose critics do no more than pillage catalogue introductions ,  or even press releases .

It is doubtful how much influence a critic has today ,  though high claims are made for Clement Greenberg as the promoter of American Abstract Expressionism .  A cynic will remember that research into the opinion - forming powers of newspapers has tended  to conclude that readers expect to have their existing views confirmed .  If so , the power of critics may be no more than the listings services offered in the <head>papers</head> or on posters , while real power can be found in the organisation of the art market . A different sort of exhibition which has had some success in attracting attention ,  and thus newspaper coverage ,  is the prize competition .  Here the critic is absolved from making judgements of his own by the need to report what a jury has decided about prizes .

The three tales are deftly assembled and get on very well together .  Chatterton is represented in the novel as an accidental suicide  slain by a cocktail of arsenic and laudanum swallowed for a venereal infection .  Poor Charles brings him to life again , however , for some further plagiarisms : a nest of antique - dealers , of antic disposition , in Chatterton 's native Bristol , have passed to Charles a cache of <head>papers</head> which , together with the discovery of what seems to be the portrait of an adult Chatterton , persuades him that the poet lived on . The portraits of Chatterton have something of the importance to the novel that the living and ageing likeness has in The Picture of Dorian Gray  .  Like Hawksmoor  and The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde  ,  this novel is a tour de force  .

Bishop Cahal Daly has argued  that the debate on multi - denominational schools has effectively taken people 's  attention away from the central issues in Northern Ireland ,  namely social injustice ,  fundamental political inequality ,  and the violence .  In reaction to this ,  one can say that the very way in which the church leaders view the subject is itself revealing of significant mediations between religion ,  state ,  and national ideology in the institutions of schooling .  In the debates over the last twenty years there has been considerable interplay of theological and sociological reasoning , with social scientists also contributing to <head>papers</head> and discussions . What has been seen as an aspect of the Roman catholic intellectual opposition to divorce in Chapter 5 can also be recognized as a feature of the defence of catholic schools too :  the opposition contains an interpretation of the moral nature of contemporary society and of what happens to catholics who are not to some degree protected from it .  In this writer 's  view ,  the arguments against multi - denominational education and in favour of catholic schools support an overall political theology which is strongly based on authority within the church .

Philosophical reflexivity is not high on the agenda and in an organization which makes much of the concept of loyalty but really means subservience ,  the insider can find it hard to bite the hand that feeds and reveal any unhealthy aspect in the agenda .  When the research is carried out by academics from outside ,  critical analysis creates enormous tensions .  Barrie Irving , director of the Police Foundation , indicated this antipathy in his title to a <head>paper</head> given to the British Psychological Society , Research into Policy wo n't go ( 1983 ) . He told his audience that C.I.D .  officers use deception ,  trickery and psychologically oriented persuasive tactics amounting to threats and inducements ,  in order to obtain confessions ;  and this process is potentiated by the custodial environment .

Inevitably this perspective will create problems for the insider as he now comes to recognize the arbitrarily constructed nature of his universe .

And of course I knew that this hierarchical organization offers the possibility of reward and incorporation into the highest ranks to those who conform to such dictates .  The dilemma followed me through the publication of a few accounts of my researches .

The vast  library on police matters was clearly under - used and there is obviously a need for a critical ethnography of the college itself ,  for it takes in numbers of senior and middle police managers each year ,  maintains a considerable staff of academics and visiting lecturers ,  but has singularly failed to provide an academically stimulating university of policing .  Even the civilian academics at the college seem to be nullified by the overriding police desire for circumspection in the written account and the preference for academic silence .  It could be anticipated that the college would have seen the creation of a continuous stream of books and <head>papers</head> generated by the rich source of material which pours through its gates , but this has hardly been the case . Two books in the recent past  ( Pope and Weiner 1981 and Thackrah 1985 )  both contain veiled indications of the problems these civil service academics encounter when they write about the police .

Then in the 1979 paper he found that subjects placed the time of occurrence of this sensation only a few milliseconds after the peripheral stimulus which evoked it .

The Commission believes that the abolition of the 20 % minimum contribution will ease the administrative burden , but notes that the consultation <head>paper</head> is vague on a number of administrative details . The paper also comments on the low proportion of expenditure to be raised through local taxation and the high gearing on tax rises .

This discussion <head>paper</head> considers points made in the Review and in the working papers . It is difficult to relate the proposals in the review to prospects for services for elderly people ,  as although it is entitled Working for Patients ,  the Review makes little mention of health care for individuals or particular client groups .  Nor does it make any statements about the costs of administrative and managerial change ,  or of the considerable developments in information technology which will be required to carry out some of its proposals .

The Dockerty family have been growing hops since Tudor times and know a thing or two about them .  They now grow Whitbread Goldings Variety ,  developed to be more resistant to wilt than the traditional East Kent type .  After years of knockabout abuse in this <head>paper</head> , lets give two muted cheers for Whitbread and their hops . Bob uses hops in the classic British bitter fashion :  Fuggles for bitterness and Goldings ,  added late in the boil ,  for aroma .  He gets his Fuggles from a leading grower named Tony Redsell at the splendidly - named Mockbeggar Farm near Faversham .

Unlike French polish ,  cold cure lacquers can be applied liberally and it is not necessary to use a good quality brush .  Three coats are usually sufficient if a high gloss finish is required .  The last coat is rubbed down with wet and dry <head>paper</head> and brought to a high gloss with a burnishing cream . Alternatively ,  the surface can be rubbed with grade 00 or 000 steel wool and wax polish to produce a smooth satin or matt finish .  When dry the surface is resistant to heat ,  solvents and abrasion .

Leave the brush in the oil for several hours ,  or longer ,  and then remove it and squeeze out the oil and work the brush backwards and forwards over plain brown paper or the side of a clean carton .  Wash in white spirit or a proprietary brush cleaner .  Straighten the bristles after cleaning and wrap with clean plain <head>paper</head> , so that the bristles maintain their shape , and then lay it on its side until it is required for use .

Use light even strokes so as not to cause bubbles to form in the film .  The first coat of varnish applied to new wood can be thinned with approximately 10 %  of white spirit .  When the first coat is dry , lightly sand with fine glasspaper or wet and dry <head>paper</head> to remove any nibs or particles of dust which may have settled on the surface . Further coats of varnish should be applied undiluted and with care to avoid runs and an uneven surface .

This is a novel of talk and opinions got out of books ,  and at one stage Dostoevsky proposed NB .  A Title :   PAPER PEOPLE ,  which survives as a phrase in Shatov 's  mouth ,  tossed up twice by the polemical flood .  A <head>paper</head> person is a walking theory , and one which may not even believe in itself ; and then the paper person will not merely have nobody , he will have no theory to be . He belongs to a paper society which goes through the motions of life ,  in the air ,  notionally .  Many a reader of The Possessed  will have smiled at Von Lemke 's  paper cut - outs  the conductor waving his baton ,  the bustling railway porter ,  the hell - fire gesticulating preacher  and at the same time he will have wondered why the microcosmic animated toys feel so supremely right for this novel .

The dangerous consequences of Peter are much canvassed in the notebooks :  the social unsteadiness  (  shatost  )  ,  as Shatov says .  Thus the cappy man has become the shaky man ,  the waverer .  And once again the motif is transpersonalized , for in the novel Shatov proves himself more than ordinarily resolute ; his <head>paper</head> Slavophilism does n't touch his human courage as husband and friend and enemy . Events and tendencies are bigger than he is ,  and while not shaky in himself he gets dealt the final shove of murder .  ( ii )

She has good reason to be pleased .  She has done something ,  something on a different plane from making a toy church or pipping a social rival at the post or committing a mindless atrocity .  Her actions are unquestionably deedy ; they bear no theoretical burden , unlike Kirillov 's suicide ; they run deeper while she is on the job than the <head>paper</head> person in her , and they make a rigid , final opposing of the profane midwife and the God - seeking husband academic and quite inadequate to the novel . Nor does it get us anywhere to learn from Anna Dostoevsky 's  Memoirs  that the story of the frantic Shatov ,  where phrasing seems inevitable and images unsought  it does n't help to be told by the novelist 's  widow that these flawless pages lean heavily on his own behaviour while their first child was being born .  It 's  all a question of what a writer can use ,  what the work in hand will let him use .

Having crossed the Siemens '  Brothers homeland ,  it  then clipped through a southern corner of Russia heading for Tehran ,  where it had its only interconnection before continuing on to the Indian sub - continent .  In the course of construction engineers and technicians survived fearful seas ;  had been protected by Russian soldiers ;  used ,  along with their equipment ,  as a form of target practice by turbulent natives and  on an individual level  had fallen victim to a positively bewildering variety of exotic diseases .  The line itself was very much state - of - the - art for the time , driven by punched <head>paper</head> tape and the section between London and Tehran had ten Wheatstone automatic repeaters installed as standard .

Cable code signals  three - condition signals  were sent to line via the siphon recorder and its shunts SS1 and RSI giving pulse working to the distant terminal where the received signals passed through the recorder coils ,  the high - resistance inductive shunt RS2 to earth ,  via SR2 .  In 1870 however ,  the brilliant Sir Charles Wheatstone invented the first ,  effective automatic telegraph equipment .  The message to be sent was transposed corresponding to the dot/dash Morse code of the message into perforations on a <head>paper</head> tape ( Fig. 4 ) . The tape was then passed through an automatic transmitter ,  turning individual perforations into dot/dash signals for the line and considerably improving speed of the telegraph .  The first Atlantic cable operated at a speed of around 3 words/min ,  equating to a bandwidth of about 1.5Hz/s .

Six Notes on Ezra Pound Ezra among the Edwardians If I wanted to be pretentious , I might call this <head>paper</head> an investigation of the sociology of literature .

The City put the shares up 4p to 565p ,  but that seems to have been largely on the basis of the optimistic tone of the statement and the general state of the market than from any in - depth analysis of the figures .

Letter :  The real Pharisees From Rabbi JOHN D. RAYNER Sir : While tending to agree with the Archbishop of Canterbury 's social critique as reported in your <head>paper</head> ( 'Runcie attack on Pharisees revives rift with Tories ' , 2 October ) , I find his reference to the Pharisees more than a little unfortunate . For about 100 years Jewish and Christian scholars have demonstrated over and over again that the stereotype of the Pharisees found in the Gospels is a distortion which reflects the animosity of the Evangelists rather than the historical truth or even the attitude of Jesus himself .  Far from being inclined towards self - righteousness ,  the Pharisees taught Be humble before all men ,  and revered their teacher Hillel for his extreme humility ;  and far from being judgemental ,  they urged Do not judge your fellow man until you are in his position and Always judge others by the scale of merit  ( that is ,  charitably )  .

West Germany 's  actions are utterly shortsighted ,  wrote Pravda in the guise of a commentary by its correspondent in East Berlin .  They were an assault on the stability in the centre of Europe ,  in which every nation of our continent places its hopes .  What the <head>paper</head> scathingly called the story of the refugees had been whipped up by a noisy propaganda campaign dripping with chauvinism and nationalism . And behind the West German media stood the country 's  politicians ,  nursing illusions about the recreation of a new German Reich with the pre - war frontiers of 1937 .  Such language is infinitely more virulent that anything emanating from the Soviet foreign ministry after the deal four days ago between Bonn and East Berlin ,  which allowed some some 5,000 East Germans who had taken shelter in the two embassies to leave unmolested for the West .

In the 1950s and 1960s the royal castles were examined in detail by various authorities ,  but it was the great baronial buildings in Wales that attracted King .  From the 1950s through to the early 1980s he published an important series of papers ,  the majority in the Cambrian Archaeological Association 's  Archaeologia Cambrensis ,  notably on the Pembrokeshire castles of Carew ,  Manorbier and Pembroke ,  and the native Welsh castles of Dinas Bran and Caergwrle in the north of the principality .  At the same time as he was working on individual buildings , King produced his lists of all the castles in Wales and the Marches , as well as more detailed <head>papers</head> on the counties of Breconshire and Cardiganshire . His fieldwork in England and Wales led him to visit virtually every castle with visible remains ,  from humble earthwork upwards ,  culminating in the publication of his Castellarium Anglicanum  ( 1983 )  .  This two - volume work details all the castles built in England and Wales ,  and reference will always be made to it as long as castles are studied .

The press ,  at Ivry ,  a suburb south - east of Paris ,  is the most technologically advanced in Europe and will enable Le Monde to print in colour and to produce 64 - page newspaper ,  a third as much again .  With so many pages ,  the decision to divide the paper into separate sections :  home and foreign news ,  society and culture ,  economics and business news with special supplements ,  books and ideas on Friday ,  arts and listings on Thursday and a radio/television guide at the weekend ,  has been dictated by the problems of readability as much as anything else .  The <head>paper</head> was just getting too unwieldly , we needed to give our readers some help in finding their way around the paper , says Mr Fontaine . He also hopes the new format will attract new readers ,  both those who do not regularly read a daily newspaper and converts from the rival Liberation  -  which has won an extraordinary success among younger readers with its mix of lively writing ,  news features and bold use of photography and design .  Mr Fontaine admits that the society and culture section of the new - look Le Monde has been inspired by Liberation 's  treatment of similar subject - matter .

Not all the Le Monde journalists support the change ,  which is the result of two years '  market research and several dummy editions .  A professional designer ,  Jean Bayle ,  with a track record for breathing new life into tired titles ,  was hired but the changes he favoured were deemed rather too radical and ,  in the end  as is often the case on Le Monde where the staff hold a significant stake in the company  the consensus view prevailed .  For the chief sub - editor , Daniel Vernet , it has not been an easy transition : We had to make sure that the <head>paper</head> read as a single publication , but that each section stood up on its own , while avoiding undue repetition , he explains . All this disruption coincides with preparations to move to a new offices early next month ,  when all editing and layout will be done on computers .  Meanwhile ,  there are plans to change the management structure so as to divide responsibility for editorial content ,  day - to - day management and the business side of the Le Monde publishing empire more logically .

The postwar generation ,  unschooled in the brutality of hardships of war and reconstruction ,  compares its lot with that of West Germans ,  with double their standard of living ,  rather than with their neighbours to the East ,  to whom the mountains of sausages and pigs '  trotters in butchers '  shops would seem like a dream come true .

Yesterday , Achievements marched up and down the grey columns of the party <head>paper</head> Neues Deutschland with more than usual determination . The solid education system ,  full if unexciting shops ,  the fact that East Germany is socialism 's  only economic miracle ,  ranking among the world 's  top 10 industrial countries  it all bores people unspeakably ,  as much as those triumphal lists of foreign dignitaries attending today 's  ceremonies ,  and the constant reminder that 135 countries recognise the 1945 Soviet occupation zone as a second German state .

In many cases ,  this form of guaranteed sales is running at barely half that of 1989 ,  when the boom was such that the government was forced to drop limits on subscriptions ,  which it claimed were forced upon it by lack of newsprint .

For Trud , the union <head>paper</head> which claims the largest daily sale of close to 20 million , the figure is 54 per cent . Both liberal and conservative publications have been hit .

But no one associated with the pending 500m  ( 312m )  sale would say whether the West German government has yet indicated its final approval .

On <head>paper</head> , however , the vessels would be on the order of the United States , enabling Israel to receive American financing and circumventing West German export restrictions .

There are two other main options .  The party could create an electoral college ,  simply giving the trade unions and constituencies set proportions .  The national executive 's consultation <head>paper</head> suggests a trade union/constituency party split of 70/30 . One variation on that would be to increase the constituency share according to the national increase in membership  so constituencies would have 30 per cent of the vote on a membership of 300,000  ( as now )  but would get an extra 1 per cent of the vote for every 30,000 increase in national membership .  Then if membership doubled ,  the balance would move to 60/40 in the unions '  favour .

I want the emotion taken out of this debate .  It may be impossible to stop the trade in ivory ,  so a compromise must be found ,  he said .  At present , trade in African ivory worth millions of dollars is allowed by CITES , under a system of quotas , with tusk markings and shipment <head>papers</head> designed to catch out sales of poached tusks . The quota system ,  which critics claim permits poached ivory to enter legal trade ,  was set up as African elephant numbers fell from an estimated 1.3 million in 1979 to about 600,000 today .  The dispute arises because poaching and habitat destruction has vastly reduced elephant herds in central and eastern Africa ,  but wildlife management further south has meant rising populations ,  which are regularly culled to raise foreign exchange .

I am there to look after our people ,  and what good people they are .  Thus Tony Benn ,  in June 1975 and three months into his tenure as Secretary of State for Industry ,  summed up what this volume is all about  his vain attempt to persuade government and Civil Service to implement Labour Party policy and bring about an irreversible shift of power and wealth to the working class .  And how he tried speeding from study group to policy committee , from National Executive Committee to Cabinet , from office to platform , spraying out speeches , press releases and lengthy <head>papers</head> reminding his colleagues of what had been said in their manifesto . At every turn he met bewilderment ,  cynicism or hostility he found difficult to understand .  Night in ,  night out he sat at home in his basement office dictating his account of the day ,  and seeking to record and explain for posterity what was going wrong .

His work ,  in his British Yearbook of International Law articles on customs ,  reprisals and jurisdiction ,  and Intervention in World Politics are described by fellow international lawyers as classic .  The article Jurisdiction in International Law is one of the most widely cited ,  and is extensively relied upon ,  most recently before the court of the European Community in the landmark Wood Pulp case .  In 1982 the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee asked him to write a <head>paper</head> on the Falklands , which was considered a most notable contribution to the debate in this area . Akehurst 's  passion for the subject of international law led him to embark on the writing of what became a standard student textbook ,  A Modern Introduction to International Law .  This demanded skills radically different from those displayed in his earlier highly specialised work .

Her gouache paintings on <head>paper</head> depict unpeopled interiors and flowers with a Japanese sense of colour and design , but their intriguing magic derives from the marriage of East and West . The chairs and tables ,  shopping baskets ,  watering cans and tablecloths are Western ,  as are the flowers .  They have been arranged in a Western home by the Japanese wife of Balthus ,  the great French painter .

Annely Juda has used the gallery 's  three floors to divide the exhibits into three distinct groups .  The ground floor has big architectural metal sculptures ,  dominated by the Elephant Palace whose abstract form in shiny brass echoes the monumental mass of an elephant and scores the top price at 250,000 .  The first floor contains <head>paper</head> sculptures he has used torn , cut , folded and painted paper to form provocative jumbles contained in plexiglass cases ; these abstract explorations of texture and form , which closely parallel his metal pieces , are attractively priced at 10,000 . It is clearly harder work to produce smaller images in metal ;  the contorted metal forms in the third - floor gallery ,  mostly two to three foot high ,  cost between 40,000 and 60,000 .  Fischer Fine Art is showing Elisabeth Frink ,  the grande dame of British sculpture .

The Independent has discovered that another important survey of sexual behaviour connected with Aids research ,  commissioned by the health department ,  was prevented from being published .  The British Market Research Bureau had examined how the sexual habits of homosexuals had changed between 1986 and 1989 .  Its <head>paper</head> was to be presented to a Market Research Society seminar last March when , with three days ' notice , the health department instructed the authors to withdraw it . It was cut out of conference papers and replaced with a notice slipped into the file saying :  The proposed paper on the Aids monitor has unfortunately had to be withdrawn ,  since it has not been possible to synchronise the publication with the Health Education Authority 's  own report on the 1988 data ,  expected in the near future .  The paper has still not been published .

Therapeutically ,  this resistance can often be overcome by insulin injections .  The increase in concentration of insulin seems to force a response from the slow or faulty system .  Two of the <head>papers</head> in Science came from Japan and reported on individuals suffering from Type A syndrome , a rare variant of Type 2 diabetes . In both cases it seems that the problem lay in the transmission of the activation signal across the target cell membrane ,  once insulin has bound to the surface receptor .  The activation molecule is an enzyme called tyrosine kinase and in both individuals this molecule was not functioning properly because they had inherited a faulty kinase gene .

The activation molecule is an enzyme called tyrosine kinase and in both individuals this molecule was not functioning properly because they had inherited a faulty kinase gene .  But the faults in the genes and the resultant proteins were different in each case :  one producing an enzyme molecule with large structural changes ,  the other having a single amino acid change at a critical part of the molecule .  The third <head>paper</head> , from the US , reports work with rats given diabetes experimentally with the drug streptozotocin . Analysis of cells from these rats showed that drug action had interfered with the expression of genes for some of the proteins designed to move sugar into muscle and fat cells ,  exactly the target tissues which must be stimulated by insulin if they are to take up excess sugar .  This provides circumstantial evidence that some cases of human Type 2 diabetes result from a similar failure .

Katharine Hamnett is a contradictory ,  impulsive figure :  a feminist who sells on sex ,  a vegetarian hedonist ,  a Labour voter with two sons at private school and a 20m turnover .  Some find her inconsistencies maddening ,  failing to understand how a right - on feminist could have done such a thing as using Mandy Smith in her show at the very height of the tabloid fuss over Smith 's  under - age relationship with Bill Wyman .  ( Though it certainly got Hamnett 's clothes in the <head>papers</head> ) . Katharine Hamnett 's  instinct for kicking against the Establishment comes partly out of the mind - set of her own particular generation ,  partly out of a reaction to an upper middle - class upbringing .  She was born Katharine Appleton in Gravesend in 1948 into a diplomatic family ,  and remembers herself as the girl on the reception line at dull diplomatic occasions in various European embassies while her father carried out his duties as an air attache .
