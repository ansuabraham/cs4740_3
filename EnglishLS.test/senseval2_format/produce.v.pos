It is thought that the Government may soon double this fine .  Since its implementation ,  fines totalling more than 24 million have been imposed under the Act and clearly some airlines have adopted practices aimed at minimizing the number of penalties incurred .  The fining of airlines plus the fact that the nationals of many refugee - <head>producing</head> countries now need visas to travel to this country , has made it extremely difficult for many people wishing to apply for asylum , to reach the UK . When people are fleeing from fear of imprisonment ,  torture or death ,  they will use any means available to reach a safe country .  For many people attempting to escape from state persecution ,  it is impossible to apply for a passport to the very authorities who are inflicting the persecution .

It might be thought that this was a natural consequence of the popularity of great artists ,  but in fact the economics of publishing result in some bizarre decisions about art books .  The reader with a love of art is not always at the front of a publisher 's  attention .  Art books are expensive to <head>produce</head> , especially if they contain colour illustrations . One way for a publisher to finance the publication of an art book is to act with other publishers who will share costs ;  an alternative is to find a subsidy .  Both these strategies affect choices of subjects for art books .

An exception may be illustrated by a passage from a classic biography ,  that of John Constable by Charles Leslie .  Leslie was himself a painter ,  and thus comments in his own right on his friend 's  art ,  as here on a painting of Hampstead Heath :  I have before noticed that what are commonly called warm colours are not necessary to <head>produce</head> the impression of warmth in landscape ; and this picture affords , to me , the strongest possible proof of the truth of this . The sky is of the blue of an English summer day ,  with large ,  but not threatening ,  clouds of a silvery whiteness .  The distance is of a deep blue ,  and the near trees and grass of the freshest green ;  for Constable could never consent to parch up the verdure of nature to obtain warmth .

In seeing African sculpture reproduced ,  the reader can remember that this art is to an extent being misrepresented by photography .  Secondly ,  the formal analysis which is second nature to a Western critic can be fruitful ,  even though it could be argued that this is a way of interpreting the objects of an unfamiliar culture rather than a description .  A further type of difficulty arises in descriptions of works <head>produced</head> in far Eastern cultures . While a Western eye is familiar with the process of looking ,  as it were ,  through an image to what it represents or means ,  an Eastern critic looks also at the surface of a painting or a drawing ,  in which a poem or other calligraphic element may form an integral part of the work .  Chinese painting and calligraphy are visual arts on much of an equal footing .

What changed with the partition of Ireland in 1920 was that the two dominant alliances were internally reorganized .  In particular the protestant bloc lost the Southern protestant landowning gentry .  The two alliances were ascribed territories in which to <head>produce</head> their social structures , political institutions , coercive bodies , informal and interpersonal networks of maintaining influence , and more clearly defined hegemonic cultures . The two societies gave expression to their own dominant interests as far as possible unhindered by each other 's  interference .  The process was assisted in the North by the self - exclusion of Britain from internal Ulster affairs by setting up the Stormont parliament which survived from 1922 to 1972 .

During the 20th century an historic architectural character  perhaps most typically that of the timber framed building  has become popular with ,  and desirable to ,  both publicans and brewers .  In many cases this has resulted in the introduction of faked features and the associated destruction of existing features which ,  though often of architectural and historic interest in their own right ,  do not fit in with the designer 's  concept of the pub 's  ideal form .  Artificial plastic beams are frequently introduced , ceilings are stripped of plaster to reveal floor joists that were never intended to be seen , other timbers are artificially blackened to create a supposedly traditional though in fact inauthentic black and white effect and render or plaster is removed from walls to <head>produce</head> rustic charm . At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .  In recent years serious damage to the historic interiors of pubs has resulted from the creation of the open - plan which now seem to be pubs '  standard internal layout .

Greenhill  ( 1981 )  ,  then a lecturer at the college ,  discussed this history of police/sociology antagonism in detail ,  arguing a tendency in each side to discredit the other ;  resulting in a situation where the number of published British texts and research studies on the sociology of the police may be numbered on the fingers of both hands .  I suspect Greenhill was referring specifically to a dearth in the cultural analysis of policing ,  while his use of the duality of sides reveals another parallel binary to that of cops and robbers ,  with the police and sociology arraigned against each other in yet another of the wars which the police wage against those who defile the sanctity of their definition of the concept of order .  Constant separations between the two categories are promoted , <head>producing</head> a dichotomized vision of left - wing , radical reformists , antagonistic to the right - minded boys in blue and includes a wealth of negative imagery of sociology which is lodged deep in the collective consciousness of the police mind . The sociologist ,  as I shall illustrate ,  is the despised ,  hairy ,  intellectual subversive ,  who is set against the clean and ordered British bobby .  To reinforce a belief in their own omnipotence and popularity ,  the police have made increasing use of market research to show they are well liked ;  especially by that important category the silent majority .

Quite often the divisional boundaries in the amalgamated force mirror the old ,  small force boundaries and men define themselves  in relation to their early experience with perhaps an inner city ethic ,  a large - town police style ,  or in the framework of a more rural situation .

This acquisition of special knowledge meant that when I was called to give evidence to the Advisory Council on Drug Abuse  ( chaired by Baroness Wooton )  on the use of cannabis ,  I was perhaps more inclined to dwell on the symbolic dangers attributed to its use than on any alleged physical harm ,  simply because I was now aware that any reality in relation to cannabis use was more complex than could be contained in some easy binary of social value  medical debilitation .  Such awareness provided another means for the obsessive anxieties of the establishment to be counterbalanced from within ,  and as Jacobi  ( 1967 :  22 )  suggests ,  created the potential ability to look truths in the eye and the courage to renounce what is no longer compatible .  This , however , <head>produces</head> a further paradox , for this reflexive style , welding the practical mastery and special knowledge of the subjective insider to an objective interpretation of events is not one the institution of policing is geared up to handle .

The point of the experiments was this :  strong social pressure  was being put on these children to agree to a realist answer  ( they were not allowed out of the room until they had an answer !  )  and if their usual tendency to interpret questions phenomenally is a trivial and weak effect then this social pressure should obliterate it .  The result was that the social pressure had no effect at all .  In children between four and eight years of age there was absolutely no difference between the number of realist answers <head>produced</head> by the pairs and by the control , solo children . They knew the realist option but did not take it as a way out of a social impasse ,  because ,  I would argue ,  the phenomenalist tendency of thought is too strong .

Muscles are made up of fibres which have different mechanical properties ,  and two of the main groups of fibres are called fast twitch fibres and slow twitch fibres .  The fast twitch fibres have a much higher contraction speed and are associated with dynamic bursts of energy .  The slow twitch fibres react much more slowly and are more resistant to fatigue , <head>producing</head> greater endurance . Thus it is clear that you need to work on the fast twitch muscles if you want to improve your speed .  The ratio of fast twitch to slow twitch fibres varies between individuals and is determined by heredity .

The length of time for these processes to occur is very short  ( up to 6 seconds )  .  After this the energy is supplied by the breakdown of muscle glycogen into lactic acid .  Glycogen is <head>produced</head> from complex carbohydrate , and therefore the energy required for training is ultimately derived from the complex carbohydrates you eat . It is possible to break down fat to use as energy when you are training ,  but it is essentially glycogen which is the energy source .  In order to ensure that enough glycogen is present for training ,  carbohydrates should make up approximately half of your daily diet .

One other quality of timber which bears on marquetry ,  and of which you should always be aware ,  is that of texture .  In this context ,  texture is the visual equivalent of the feel of a given surface .  In wood this is <head>produced</head> by flecking ( oak ) , ripple ( mahogany ) , sheen ( satinwood ) , dappling ( lacewood ) , and even insect attack ( masur birch ) !

Use of line Designs composed of small masses of veneer forming a readable picture ,  correspond roughly in looks ,  if not in colour ,  to subjects as they actually appear to the eye ;  they seem to be in 3D even though they are flat ,  and to a degree they are naturalistic .  There is another branch of graphics , however , in which an image is <head>produced</head> by the use of line rather than mass . In its most basic form the technique involves merely an outline ,  or when it is filled in ,  a silhouette ;  but of course it can be much more elaborate than that .  Linear representation of solid form has always been a valid artistic technique ,  especially in drawing  ( as distinct from painting )  ,  and it can be used in marquetry work also provided the nature of the material  ( ie .  wood )  is not ignored .

As a design project it is perhaps the most exploited .

Whereas it is simple to make a robust chair , combining these three characteristics and yet <head>producing</head> a chair which has individual character can be a real challenge . I would imagine that most chairs made by craftsmen are of the spindled variety ,  from the Windsor to the Shaker and many shades in between .  Although no one will doubt their possibilities for elegance and robustness ,  sitting on a solid wood seat can test the limits of comfort after quite a short time and woven seats are little better .

However ,  to satisfy the requirements of comfort ,  the back should curve  ( in the horizontal plane )  to accommodate the back of the rib cage ,  and there should be no large obstruction to the positioning of the backbone .  These two points provide objections to the ladderback design ;  with sitters of different heights ,  the cross bars can hit prominent vertebrae .  The thought of <head>producing</head> many curved back pieces is a bit off - putting . With the stickback style ,  however ,  it is only necessary to curve the top piece ;  the sticks would then position themselves into a curve ,  even from a straight base .  This base can be the rear seat rail ,  or another rail fitted above the seat ,  but if so ,  no more than 2in above the seat or it would also need to be curved to avoid discomfort .

An important feature of the 1980s which has contributed to InterCity 's  financial turnround is market segmentation and pricing  or the shaping of products to meet the needs of customer groupings .  Essentially this concept is not new  from the early days our railways were providing first -  ,  secondand even third - class accommodation and the excursion ticket was quickly used to sell spare capacity .  What is new is the much greater degree of sophistication which is now necessary to <head>produce</head> the maximum revenue yield from each and every InterCity journey . Today 's  equipment  trains and track  is very expensive to provide and maintain ;  to cover its basic costs it has to be in service providing revenue for up to say sixteen hours per day .

Authority was obtained for the modernisation of the Chiltern line between Marylebone and Banbury via Bicester including resignalling and the provision of seventy - seven Class 165 Networker coaches ,  and in August the then new Minister of Transport ,  Cecil Parkinson ,  authorised the first hundred Networker four - car trains for the North Kent lines .  The decade could hardly have ended on a more optimistic note .  While it has to be obvious that current success has been built on foundations that were perhaps sounder than people generally thought ten years ago , the combination of a livelier economy and greater commercial drive ( leading above all to more commonsense , usually more local management ) has <head>produced</head> results far above the most rosy forecasts . The pride taken not only by many staff but passengers in their more clearly identified Lines is paying handsome dividends .  But four main factors are singled out by Chris Green for the currently greatly improved outlook :  the record investment currently being made ,  at the end of 1989 amounting to an astonishing million pounds a day ;  the success of the Networker train whose carriages in 1989 were being delivered at the rate of one a day ;  the enormous level of London station development both enhancing the environment  ( who at the start of the 1980s would have thought of treating a terminus as a shopping precinct ?  )  and producing revenue on the grand scale ;  and the steady introduction of Integrated Electronic Control Centres  ( discussed in detail in the signalling chapter )  .

( The asbestos had been built into the carriages to act as sound and heat insulation ,  but had of course later been found to be a health hazard .  )  The same work was also required in a large number of the early Mark 2 locomotive - hauled carriages ,  and in many long - life electric multiple units .  It emerged that across the very varied fleets the cost of asbestos removal would be 25,000 per vehicle , an investment <head>producing</head> no financial return . The question had to be asked :  could the purchase of new trains produce savings sufficient to cover the cost of servicing their capital costs as well as reducing the burden on the PSO ?

Its problem ,  when analysed by the new Provincial sector was its price :  it would cost too much to enable a financial case to be made for the 210 breed to replace existing DMUs even taking asbestos removal into account .

By the late 1970s CAMRA ,  now known as the Campaign for Real Ale ,  had more than 28,000 members .  Its presence had at first been derided by the national brewers but its campaigning zeal attracted continual media attention and many independent brewers had been encouraged to return to cask beer production with enthusiasm .  By the time CAMRA celebrated its first ten years it could pride itself on a large national membership and a series of hardhitting reports that had exposed the market domination of the big brewers and the shoddy beers they <head>produced</head> .

British lagers are rarely stored  ( from the German word lagered )  for the period needed to develop taste .

The brewers of these beers want to <head>produce</head> them as fast as possible and use chemical additives to speed up fermentation , cut down on yeast head to get more liquid into the fermenters and to produce a beer with a thick head of foam . These beers are also made with substantial levels of adjuncts to the malt mash :  maize ,  rice ,  triticale ,  wheat flour and potato starch .  British brewers do not have to declare the ingredients they use but when American consumers ran a check of Miller Lite they found it contained corn syrup ,  propylene glycol alginate ,  papain enzymes and potassium metabisulphite .

Moreover the extraction leaves undesirable chemicals such as pesticides behind .  Carbon dioxide also offers the flexibility to separate the hop components into bitter and flavour fractions .  This advantage is considerable since the bitter fraction may then be chemically manipulated to <head>produce</head> bitter iso a acids from the a acids and so provide a PIKE product which may be added towards the end of the boil or even afterwards . Near 100 per cent utilisation of the hop a  acid is possible by this process .  Flavours may also be separated in the hop extract and can be fractionated .

Copper hop ,  late hop and dry hop extracts are available ,  each emphasising the flavour associated with that particular procedure .  Brewers may thus formulate a character and emphasis it in the beer .  Dry hop flavour is an interesting application since the use of a liquid extract allows a more accurate and consistent flavour to be <head>produced</head> . Moreover whole hops used for dry hopping take seven to 10 days for the character to be extracted and then slowly decline .  Dry hop extract provides immediate character which lasts longer and reduces the possibility of infection being added from whole hops or ,  more likely ,  from a dirty hand .

And David Gardner 's  defence of processed hops does remind the listener powerfully of the arguments advanced by the brewers in the 1960s when they were replacing cask ale with keg beer .

Impressed by her friend 's  Retriever 's  good nature ,  Marjorie decided on a Labrador .  She and Bill went to see a litter of pale ,  yellow puppies and Marjorie fell in love with the smallest bitch .  Marjorie named her Lizzie ( she 'd always intended to call a daughter Lizzie but had <head>produced</head> only sons ! ) and the two forged a strong bond . When such a close relationship develops between pet and owner ,  a certain empathy also builds .  Just as Marjorie stayed up all night while Lizzie was recovering from a womb infection ,  so Lizzie stayed by Marjorie 's  bedside while she recuperated after a gallstone operation .

What Wieman has done  as well as reaching the lowest temperature on record  is to simplify what has been an immensely complex piece of laboratory apparatus .  Not only has the essential large vacuum cell been reduced to a small glass cell ,  but Wieman has also been able to replace gas lasers with solid state devices .  In fact what he has been using are exactly the same as the cheap mass - <head>produced</head> lasers used in CD machines . They cost around 50 a piece ,  less than a tenth the cost of the gas lasers .  Wieman told EW  + WW  that the great benefit if this simplification is that it will enable a greater number of laboratories to participate in low temperature research and discover more and more bizarre properties of matter .

During the periods when the core is not saturated ,  the inductance of the coil causes the current passing through it to change linearly from one saturation state to the other. As the core reaches saturation the inductance falls to a low value and the current rises rapidly to a limit set by the DC resistance of the coil forcing the core well into saturation .  The waveform of this current is shown in Fig. 2 which also serves as an illustration of the magnetic field <head>produced</head> by the coil , since this must be directly proportional to the current . The induction in the core is magnified by the high permeability ,  except in the saturation regions where the result can be seen to be a trapezoidal induction waveform  ( Fig. 3 )  .  The voltage induced in the pickup coil by this waveform is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic induction .

The voltage induced in the pickup coil by this waveform is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic induction .  During the periods of saturation ,  there is no change and no signal voltage ,  but during the linearly changing regions there is a constant voltage output of appropriate polarity ,  as shown in Fig. 4 .  All of the above assumes that the only influence on the core is the magnetic field <head>produced</head> by the excitation coil . If this is not the case and the core is affected by an additional external field ,  a small change takes place in the output .  The component of external  field which is in line with the core axis either aids or opposes the excitation field in its alternating polarity phases .

Complementary outputs from the lower frequency bistable are used to operate voltage switches which connect the full supply voltage across the excitation coil in alternate directions thus providing the square voltage waveform .  A small resistor is connected in series with the coil to limit the current during core saturation .  The frequency is chosen to make sure that the core reaches saturation at each alteration , but does not spend any more than a short time in this condition so as to maximise the final output signal ; the circuit should <head>produce</head> as many saturation signals as possible . The pickup coil signals connect to analogue switches controlled by the first  ( and higher frequency )  bistable in the driving divider chain ,  in order to isolate only those signals which coincide with the saturation waveform transitions .  The signals from the two switches are fed to two operational amplifiers configured as simple RC low - pass filter/integrators .

The total component of the earth 's  magnetic field in the UK is around 47 000 gamma inclined at around 67 to the horizontal .  The particular core and winding arrangement used in the design has an intrinsic sensitivity of about 12mV/gauss or  0.12V/gamma .  A gain of 400 in the first amplifier/filter will then <head>produce</head> an output of almost two and a half volts from the total earth 's field vector , avoiding overload and permitting a peak - to - peak measurement by rotating the core . Calibration The core is aligned with one coil picking up the north - south field and inclined at roughly 67 to the horizontal and adjusted so as to produce the largest positive output from the amplifier .

This is not as difficult to do as it sounds ,  simply because of the very broad maxima and minima .  If the intention is to make serious measurements calibration with a Helmholtz coil will be required .  The outlined design <head>produces</head> a field of 3.95 gauss/ampere . Strictly this implies a precision greater than is reasonable and should probably be read as 4.0 gauss/ampere or 400 gamma/mA  ( one gauss = 100 000 gamma )  .  The sensitivity sought at the test point is 20 000 gamma/volt :  + 2.5V corresponds to a range of 100,000 gamma so the initial Helmholtz coil current setting should cover this .

This radiation may increase the depth of the D layer due to ionisation and produce the all too well known Dellinger face out when long - distance HF communication ceases abruptly .  Corpuscular or particulate radiation appears in the form of protons and neutrons which take longer to reach the earth 's  upper atmosphere than the higher energy radiations .  These nuclear particles arrive at the F1 and F2 layers approximately 48 hours following a solar event and <head>produce</head> ionisation by colliding with gaseous molecules and cosmic particles . This explains why so few protons are detectible at the earth 's  surface except after very major events .  The increased ionisation along the earth 's  lines of magnetic force make them more conductive and leads to an increased current flow with consequent rise in magnetic flux levels .

Therefore ,  extra headroom has to be provided for the operating flux .  As a result another apparent advantage often cited for the Cuk converter  ( that it can use the full peak - to - peak bidirectional flux swing )  is ,  in practice ,  whittled away .  As for the claim that the Cuk converter approaches 90 % efficiency and <head>produces</head> minimal RF interference , exactly the same claims can be made for well - designed standard topologies . Good efficiency is mainly a matter of using good switches and rectifiers ,  since they are where most of the losses occur .  The low RF interference and low component count claims are usually made because the Cuk topology is not only able to accommodate the input and output filter chokes on the same magnetic core as the transformer ,  but it can also reduce the input and output ripple currents to very low levels .

Fig. 1 illustrates that by linking such splines at a common point and opposite tangent directions ,  an indefinite length of smooth curve can be defined with relatively little data .  Providing the underlying maths is the same for all systems using the file ,  the same shape will be reproduced each time .  Cad systems which work in 3 dimensions will <head>produce</head> drawing description files which actually describe the object being drawn , using 3D position co - ordinates . To get a view of the object a viewpoint and direction must be stated ,  and the system then computes the required 2D projection .

They allow a drawing to consist of several layers ,  equivalent to overlaid transparent sheets ,  each containing a different aspect of the drawing .  For instance ,  an architect may want an office floor plan with walls ,  furniture ,  plumbing ,  electrical wiring ,  and air conditioning all shown on different layers .  The plan can then be <head>produced</head> in different versions showing different aspects of the overall design . All such detail goes into the drawing description of file .  The result can be a very long document in a complicated coding scheme ,  but it forms a powerful description of design information without any compromise made in accuracy .

As powerful as drawing description files can be ,  they would get a bit unworkable if faced with ,  say ,  a colour photograph of a budgerigar .  This is exactly the kind of picture which we might want to save from a screen paintbrush job ;  lovely blends of colour ,  subtle shades and shapes ,  and not a straight line anywhere .  Images captured from TV , sent back from space , or more prosaically <head>produced</head> by a document scanner , are likely to fall into the same category . For this type of picture the bit image file comes into its own .  The picture is written to file in terms of pixels ,  individual spots of light or ink which ,  in suitably large numbers ,  create the picture .

Another problem is compatibility .  While a cad transfer file can describe objects with the accuracy of floating point numbers ,  a bit image file is restricted to a digitising process .  Far from being device neutral , the image file is usually coded in a way which reflects the device which first <head>produced</head> it . How should it handle transfers between different resolutions ?  At first sight the obvious answer might be to convert all images to some enormously high resolution which would satisfy any possible requirement .
