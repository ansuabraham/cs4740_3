This is the only court of appeal for cases tried by the military court ,  and looks only at points of law and not at facts and findings ,  thus providing a restricted appeal .  In October 1990 ,  Hamadi Jebali ,  who is a member of the executive council of Hizb al - Nahda ,  had received a six month 's  suspended sentence and a fine of 1500 dinars for publishing an article entitled The people of the State or the State of the people ?  in Al - Fajr in June 1990 .

In modern China an attempt has also been made to create a national art ,  in this instance by partly discrediting tradition .  In 1942 Lu Hsun was quoted by Mao Tse - tung as asserting that the aim of a modern Chinese artist should be :  By selection to accept the historical legacy of Chinese traditional art ;  to absorb the best style and technique from foreign art ;  and thus to establish a new national art in accordance with the demands and needs of the masses .  Mao <head>added</head> : To study the development of this old culture , to reject its feudal dross and assimilate its democratic essence , is a necessary condition of our new national culture . The critical distinction between feudal dross and democratic essence subsequently proved difficult to make .  This brief diversion into the cultural and political history of Germany ,  the USSR and China has been made to emphasise the way that a state may determine artistic production ,  and thence art criticism .

Catholics ,  however ,  did not vote for the Unionist Party.

One can also <head>add</head> that there is something in the present policies of the SDLP which suggest a need to maintain a somewhat fragile unity in respect of the national question . Seamus Mallon ,  MP of the SDLP may have seen the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 as a step towards a united Ireland ,  but some of his co - politicians in the party would not share that view .

The rough insiders are on the walls ,  defending God 's  true believers from Romanism and immorality .  As Buckley points out ,  it is also the rough who penetrate the virgin city  the British fleet ,  breaking the boom across the river to bring food supplies to the stricken protestants within and ensuring the city 's  survival and the faithful people 's  triumph .  One can recognize here , with Lvi - Strauss ( 1968 ) , the importance of ambiguous mediators in relating the opposites within one 's cultural universe and one can <head>add</head> the Apprentice Boys to Lvi - Strauss 's shortlist of tricksters and twins in this role . Despite Buckley 's  reluctance to play up the siege of Derry as a key myth and his preference for general categories of interpretation derived from various historical experiences ,  it does seem that the siege has particular significance .  Those who still seek compromise with catholic nationalists today are still known to the erudite leadership of the DUP as Lundies .

On the other hand ,  there was the nationalist theory of democracy ,  which derives power from the people and not from an lite group of religious intellectuals .  The next section will show the way in which this contradiction continued to be shared by a large number of clergy and laity even into the 1980s .  It should be <head>added</head> here that the high clergy hardly recognized that they had actually been exercising a political religious power of a specifically sectarian or monopolistic type . Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate ,  they meant they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state .

The two Roman catholic priests ,  who were in all respects dedicated pastors and much liked by many in the local community ,  immediately opposed the idea ,  preaching against it at Sunday masses in the local convent and the school hall .

The curate <head>added</head> to this that those promoting the integrated project were in fact promoting secularism . The fact that a prominent member of the current community council and an integrated education supporter was a member of official Sinn Fein ,  the Workers '  party ,  appeared to figure in the reasoning ,  as this party has always been suspected to be an anti - clerical and secularist force .  In residents '  association meetings ,  the clergy 's  point of view received vocal support from one or two members of the older village community which preceded the housing estate .

Not unnaturally one consequence of this reductionism is that action and pragmatism take on an extra dimension in the police mind ,  holding a special place in the institutional imagination .

For example ,  the Police Foundation is only one of the bodies publishing indices of current research on the police .

A heavy contact to the opponent 's  face may not merit just a verbal warning ;  after consultation with the other members of the panel ,  the referee can go directly to a full point penalty or even a disqualification .  In some cases the disqualification is not only from a particular event within a tournament ,  but from the whole tournament .  The second thing to note is that each offence carries its own scale of penalties , and penalties for one offence are not <head>added</head> on to penalties imposed for a different offence . Thus if I incur a verbal warning for stepping out of the area ,  I do n't then expect to receive a half - point penalty for a slight contravention of another rule.

Behind the indecision lay a youth torn in one direction by the family business ,  not least perhaps his father 's  shadow hanging over him ;  and the preferences of his mind and ever prolific imagination in the other. Accordingly , he read arts in his first year ; commerce ( which included accounting , commercial law , political science and a couple of doses of mathematics ) in his second ; arts ( though strangely retaining political science ) for his third and fourth years , to which was <head>added</head> zoology . The choices are both a reflection of his inner confusion ,  and a statement of his determination to let his curiosity run wherever it would  -  and that long before mixed courses were popular .

It lay along the  lines of Layton 's  understanding of the poetic function  which exists somewhere between fact and imagination ,  as Eli Mandel said of him. Not pure fact ,  not meretricious research ,  which observes and tames the insightful - prophetic thrust ;  not mere imagination or mental excitement  but the fruitful intercourse between the two ,  in an artistic equilibrium .  Leonard could be fastidious to the nth degree in completing his own work he has always said that he works one word at a time , and can spend months , even years , in <head>adding</head> finesse to it ; he is nevertheless dismissive of anything approaching scholarly exactitude , still more so pedantry . It is not clear where this comes from .  There is certainly an element which highly values the proprieties of artistic freedom :  a work of art must be a work of free spirit ,  untrammelled by rules and regulations ,  wherein absolute consistency  or conformity of any sort  is out of place .

For such ,  God only frowns on the world ,  and stirs it to judgment ;  the butterfly cannot break loose into flight ;  it merely expires ,  as Leonard expressed it ,  ending its life in three flag - swept days.

The BeSHT became so influential that the leaders of the people ,  the power - manipulators and self - appointed guardians of the Law ,  had no alternative but to do what their like has always done to those who broke loose ,  butterfly - like :  They excommunicated him ;  marginalised his usefulness ;  neutered his religious potency :  A prophet is not without honour Now one of the interesting cameos of God 's  providence ,  prominently found in the Talmud and among the Hasidim ,  is the idea that in every generation are 36 tsadihim  ,  pious or righteous men ,  who  ( though unknown )  keep the world going .

I have seen some fine players who compete at a high level bring in another line ,  between the service line and the baseline .

It is also advisable to take a vitamin B supplement to aid in the digestion of the carbohydrate .  Once the carbohydrate has been consumed it is stored as glycogen in the muscles and stays there until it is required for energy .  This storage of glycogen in the muscles <head>adds</head> to the overall size of the muscles . Once training is underway the glycogen is gradually removed from the muscles to produce energy and is replaced by blood ,  that is the muscles are pumped .  After training has finished the blood supply is reduced and the pump disappears ,  resulting in the muscle being smaller than before the exercise started .

In mainland Europe the spacing between tracks and reversible signalling enables engineers to work on one track in complete safety while traffic continues to pass on the other. Here the engineers have to carry out most of their work on Sundays when traffic is light ,  but this often entails diversions and extended journey times followed by temporary speed restrictions for a few further days at the beginning of each week .  To compensate for these temporary speed restrictions additional recovery time is <head>added</head> to daytime schedules . Following studies by Eastern Region 's  engineers ,  a new tracklaying strategy was introduced in 1987 whereby  with the use of a new machine called the Dynamic Track Stabiliser  tracks could be handed back by 06.00 on Monday morning at the full 125mph line speed ,  eliminating the need for a temporary speed restriction and associated recovery time allowance .  Removal of these recovery allowances made possible a general acceleration of East Coast 125mph services from May 1987 .

The stereotyped Spanish style is possibly seen at its best in Petipa 's  Don Quixote  ,  most particularly in the famous pas de deux  fur the ballerina and her partner .  The tone is set by the continual use of the pose with head held high ,  back slightly arched ,  arms in closed 4th or a stretch fully upwards in 5th sur les pointes  for Kitri or on demi - pointes  for Basil .

Only when they have examined what hands ,  arms ,  legs and feet ,  body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story ,  theme or music ,  can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture ,  with the right quality ,  mood ,  emotion ,  action and character .  The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and ,  when needed ,  help to create the atmosphere and mood of the whole .  Choreographers must then decide how many and which details they need to <head>add</head> to disclose the particular features of the story , theme and/or music that they wish to communicate . The exploration of what each part of the body can express in isolation and then in co - ordination with the rest is possibly the most important aspect of a choreographer 's  work if it seeks to be modern in spirit and technique .  Different fields of research have disclosed the many different factors that can affect both physical and mental behaviour .

There is a major difference between real ale and keg beer .  Keg ,  which includes lager ,  is known in the industry as brewery conditioned beer .  Instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to <head>add</head> a full , mature palate , keg beers are killed off in the brewery by filtration , chilling and pasteurisation . The aim is to produce beers that are sterile ,  have a long shelf life and are highly profitable .  In the case of keg milds and bitters when fermentation is complete they are conditioned for a short period under gas pressure and are then filtered to remove yeast solids and pasteurised .

The sugars dissolve into the water and the sweet liquid ,  called wort ,  is pumped to a copper .  The flowers of the hop plant add bitterness to beer and the oils in the plant also guard against any infections during the brewing process .  As the wort is boiled in the copper with the hops many brewers also <head>add</head> sugars , such as glucose or cereal syrup , to encourage a strong fermentation . CAMRA would prefer beer to be brewed solely from barley malt but the use of sugar dates back to the 19th century and many renowned beers ,  such as Marston 's  Pedigree ,  have recipes that include 10 per cent or more brewing sugars .  When the hopped wort has been cooled it is run to fermenting vessels where it meets its destiny with yeast .

When the hopped wort has been cooled it is run to fermenting vessels where it meets its destiny with yeast .  The type of yeast strain used for ale is known as top fermenting .  It works at a warm temperature and vigorously turns the sugars in the wort into alcohol and carbon dioxide , producing at the same time ripe fruity aromas that <head>add</head> to the pleasure of ale drinking . The great head of yeast created during fermentation is cropped off and after a week the remaining yeast is overcome by the alcohol it has produced and sinks to the bottom of the fermenter .  The liquid is now officially called beer but it needs a few days further conditioning in the brewery ,  to purge some of the rough alcohols ,  before it is ready to leave for the pub .

Unfortunately releasing these into the wort requires mutually  incompatable  conditions .  Flavours rapidly evaporate from hot wort while bitterness requires up to an hour to fully develop .  Brewers have been aware of this issue for centuries and have developed the practice of <head>adding</head> copper hops early in the boil to provide bitterness and aroma or late hops towards the end of the boil for flavour . While whole hops are repeatedly claimed to produce the best hop character in a beer ,  problems may be encountered .  First is the liability of hops to deterioration by oxygen in the air .

The voltages in  (  C3 ,  C2 ,  and C1  )  ,  each charge CL  through two diodes in series ,  but the charging path through C4  has only one diode ,  D11  .  This configuration results in a higher surge current through D11  and C4  and a slightly higher negative output voltage ,  unless you add a diode in series with D11  .  You can change the output voltage by <head>adding</head> or subtracting sections ; C1 , D1 , D3 , and D2 constitute one section , for example . Make the series capacitors equal in value and the total value of these capacitors equal to the load capacitor :  CL = 1/2Vrf  ,  where I is the load current ,  VR is the maximum allowed p - p ripple voltage ,  and f  is the output frequency .

However ,  the weaker the magnetic field ,  the lower the frequency needed for a given ion mass .  The weaker the AC electric field ,  the longer it takes to build up the power of those ions ,  but the build - up is unavoidable if the particle mass ,  the magnetic field strength and the AC signal frequency satisfy the formula for resonance .  In a cyclotron the energy of the particles is deployed into an orderly spiral motion around the axis of the magnetic field and the pumping action of that weak pulsating electric field progressively <head>adds</head> to that energy and causes a pressure build - up at confining surfaces as the particles are driven in spirals of larger radius . A cyclotron is fine - tuned to a resonant frequency specific to one chosen ion type .  In the blood stream ,  as in any ionised plasma ,  gaseous or liquid ,  there is a mix of positive and negative ions .

In America fashion can actually be enforced .  A few years ago ,  as part of an annual round - up of critical books for Encounter  ,  I reviewed an interestingly speculative work on modern fiction by an American academic .

A year or so later I chanced to meet him and he acknowledged that this was just criticism ,  but that he had been obliged to insert these names so that his book would look like a truly up - to - date ,  intouch work of scholarship .  In 1982 at Stanford I heard similar accounts of academic publishers requiring appropriate names and references in books .

The contradiction has long been lived with in practice ,  and students become adept in faking responses .  Nevertheless ,  it points to a flaw in the aesthetic defence of literary education ,  and one which implicitly encourages culturalist claims to take it over .  I should <head>add</head> that my own understanding of literature is largely in aesthetic terms ; at least , of poetry ; where fiction and drama are concerned , aesthetic approaches can , at best , only be partial . The idea of aesthetic education ,  as formulated by Schiller ,  seems an entirely noble one ;  the difficulty is in accommodating it to contemporary pedagogy .  This dilemma has been present since the beginnings of institutionalized literary study .

By JOHN PIENAAR ,  Political Correspondent PENNED - IN by steel barriers between a noisy crowd of gay liberationists and the lonely emissary of the oppressed African Dinkas ,  few of the street - corner causes besieging this week 's  conference seem as hopeless as the campaign for Labour to organise in Ulster .  About 15 mainly Protestant and professional Belfast - based activists have made the trip to Brighton this year , <head>adding</head> their voices to the clamour as the largely indifferent stream of Labour delegates pours from the conference centre at lunchtime . The speaking invitation to Gerry Adams ,  the Sinn Fein president and MP for West Belfast ,  and vague expectations that a Tory Party branch may be recognised in North Down ,  have provided little encouragement of a parallel shift by Labour .  It is an absolute bloody shame that the Labour Party wo n't take this thing seriously ,  David Morrison ,  45 ,  a systems analyst and secretary of the campaign of 200 - 300 members ,  said .

World title boxing ,  he suggested .  But traditional British classics ?  If it was big enough , attractive enough and our viewers would like it , he <head>added</head> . We 're not averse even to putting major sport on our movie channel ,  as HBO  ( a US cable company )  do with Wimbledon .  Already one or two phone calls have been made to the Test and County Cricket Board ,  according to Dave Hill ,  the Australian whose production of World Series Cricket for Channel 9  ( remember floodlights ,  yellow balls and pink shirts ?  )  ruffled so many establishment figures and who is now Murdoch 's  man running Eurosport .

I 've told Peter Johnson  ( his agent )  to do what everybody else is doing .  I 'm really sick of it .  he <head>added</head> . I do n't agree with many of the things that are going on .  He refused to elaborate ,  but is known to have expressed dismay at a proposed increase in prize money for doubles which would give singles only a 70 - 30 advantage .

However ,  the type of cynicism greeting the arrival of Haines ,  who was officially introduced to the media yesterday on his second day in office ,  smacks very much of a Pavlov 's  dogs response which assumes every move the Club makes is anachronistic and autocratic and therefore automatically to be shot down in flames .  Haines himself admitted that as an outsider his preconception had been that the Jockey Club was An old - fashioned ,  creaking organisation of part - timers .  However , he <head>added</head> : On my few visits prior to my appointment , and in my short time here since , I have found it very far from that . I have been extremely impressed by the professionalism of the Jockey Club .  Haines ,  50 ,  should certainly know exactly what it takes to run a multi - million - pound industry ,  having climbed through the ranks to become chairman of the United Sugar Merchants Association .

Manchester United .  .  0 Portsmouth .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  0  ( United win 3 - 2 on agg )  THE NEWS for England is excellent .  Bryan Robson ,  doubtful for the World Cup match against Poland 24 hours ago ,  returned for United last night to cruise for 20 minutes before erupting into Captain Marvel ,  never shirking a tackle and being denied two goals only by the crossbar and a brilliant diving save from Alan Knight .  The news for United 's vast following is less euphoric ; a subdued crowd of 26,698 , the backlash to the Derby defeat , saw them fail to <head>add</head> to the three goals of the first leg . Portsmouth must take some of the blame for the stalemate for they came defensively formed and defensively minded ,  and content to rely on breakaways to snatch an equaliser and ,  faintly possibly ,  a winner .  They almost achieved the former on the stroke of injury - time when Kevin Ball headed against the underside of Jim Leighton 's  bar .
