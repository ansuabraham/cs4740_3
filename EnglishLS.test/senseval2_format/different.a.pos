If the two girls compare notes one day ,  the New Yorker will complain about the useless articles she read ;  the newspaper articles were almost always short ,  written maybe by hard - pressed critics who were only allowed short articles ,  further cut down by sub - editors .  Still ,  by reading ,  and looking at Lee Krasner 's  pictures in New York galleries ,  she was able to defend an independent liking for her SoHo artist .  In London , it was a rather <head>different</head> story , since the literature available needed discrimination , much of it being historical and iconographic , establishing data of little interest to the art student . To her surprise ,  there proved to be perceptive judgements about qualities in Michelangelo 's  work ,  almost hidden in catalogue entries ;  more than one art historian ,  apparently ,  was not only learned but had an eye .

A teacher 's  list for analysing pictures may be something like that of the American educationalist Thomas Munro :  first impressions of the picture as a whole ,  line ,  light and dark ,  colour ,  mass ,  space ,  unity of design .  Books on art appreciation will also concern themselves with formal questions ,  as they have done since the beginning of the century .  In a book called How to Appreciate Pictures by R. C. Witt , written in 1902 , the chapter headings are not so <head>different</head> : drawing , colour , light and shade , composition , treatment , methods and materials . A supplementary approach to school art instruction is to draw attention to the types of subject in art ,  such as portraiture ,  narrative ,  landscape .  This thematic method is combined in many introductory courses with formal analysis which is closer to the way that many artists describe pictures .

In discussing Drer ,  he treated him as the most versatile artist of a triumvirate ,  whose other members were Marcantonio Raimondi and Lucas van Leyden .  Of the latter he wrote ,  Lucas van Leyden is an artist of frailer calibre than Drer ,  and prone to lose himself in imitation of stronger men ,  each of his contemporaries in turn dominating his style .  Another book about the age of Drer , but on a <head>different</head> topic , is The Limewood Sculptors of Renaissance Germany , by Michael Baxandall , published in 1980 . The author started his career in the Victoria and Albert Museum ,  where there is an important group of this sculpture ;  his book had a double origin in a museum exhibition and a series of lectures .  Divisions in the book are unusually clear ,  separate chapters being given to topics such as function ,  the market ,  or the historical and political background of the subject .

When I see the Giotto frescoes at Padua I do not trouble to recognise which scene in the life of Christ I have before me ,  but I perceive instantly the sentiment which radiates from it and which is instinct in the composition in every line and  color  .  The title will only serve to confirm my impression .  In a <head>different</head> context , but also on the issue of religion , an American book on the Aztecs by the archaeologist Vaillant commented tartly : The Aztecs did not have a term for fine arts ,  nor did they speculate about aesthetics ,  nor make objects to be contemplated for their beauty alone .  They had none of the socially sterile attitude towards art which we adopt in our own culture .

Instead ,  he put a rich range of clear rainbow colours on his palette ,  replacing the dirty ochre colours with light and more luminous chromium colours ,  with the addition of Veronese green ,  ultramarine and lacquer colours ,  and following the Impressionist recipe in not mixing these colours with anything except white or closely allied colours .  Interpretation of the artist 's  work ,  however ,  depends on the artist 's  own account ,  since Nordenfalk had the deliberate intention of presenting Van Gogh the writer and thinker .  The sober intentions of his book were very <head>different</head> from the novels , plays and films which have created a mythical figure in modern culture of the artist as isolated and neglected , recognised only after his death , and whom the phrase genius and madness are near aligned seems to fit . The novel Lust for Life  by Irving Stone ,  published in 1934 ,  is the most famous of these productions ,  popularising a vein of interpretation established early in the century by some of Van Gogh 's  first advocates ,  such as the taste - maker Julius Meier - Graefe ,  who defended Van Gogh in 1906 ,  and went on to write a book in his praise in 1921 called Vincent  .  But this was a drama ,  the story of the circumstances of Van Gogh 's  life ;  No attempt has  been made ,  wrote Meier - Graefe ,  to make a critical analysis of the pictures ,  which enter upon the scene only in so far as they concern the drama directly or indirectly .

Sculpture parks are an enjoyable innovation of the late twentieth century ,  or perhaps it would be better to say a welcome adaptation of an existing practice .  In the seventeenth century Louis XIV had a sculpture park at Versailles ,  but it surrounded his palace ,  and was more formally designed by Le Ntre ,  who needed sculptures for the focal points of his avenues .  Twentieth - century sculpture parks are less rigidly planned , and intended to accommodate sculpture by artists in many <head>different</head> styles . The site can be adapted to suit the sculpture ,  which has a dominant role ,  unlike sculpture destined for the decoration of palatial gardens .  Commemorative figures in city squares ,  portrait busts ,  tomb or cemetery furniture have also been traditionally restricted by the terms of commissions .

A first broad division between types of exhibitions needs to be made .  There are shows which could be grouped under the heading of historical exhibitions ;  there are mixed exhibitions and group exhibitions of works by living artists ;  and there are exhibitions in dealers '  galleries ,  notably solo shows .  The catalogues which accompany these events have rather <head>different</head> characters , for although there are entries for the exhibited works in each sort of catalogue , and usually an introduction , historical catalogues often have additional essays . Catalogues of major shows have also become bigger and more expensive in recent years ,  usually through the help of national ,  industrial or commercial sponsorship .  A characteristic historical exhibition may be called something like The Age of Rembrandt ,  or Shock of Recognition ;  the landscape of English Romanticism and the Dutch seventeenth - century school ;  both of these are actual titles .

The nature of Burne - Jones 's  aims and predilections in art are well - enough known by this time ,  and have been defined by himself absolutely fitted to this thought :  I mean by a picture a beautiful romantic dream of something that never was ,  never will be  in a light better than any light that ever shone  in a land no one can define or remember ,  only desire .  If any one element in his style is to be singled out as predominant ,  it is that haunting expression of far - away desire never absent from the eyes and lips ,  and conveyed in every gesture ,  feature and attitude .  Giacometti was an artist with very <head>different</head> artistic aims , clearly expounded by Valerie J. Fletcher in a catalogue for an exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden , Washington , in 1988 . Writing about a small bust on a column ,  a thin sculpture in a series of four busts of which the others were fuller in form ,  she comments that the extremely thin proportions of the head contrast with the solidity of the base .  So delicately modulated are the forms of the head that the human element appears ephemeral .

Mathematical perspective of a Renaissance sort had not been used in European medieval art ,  where the size of a figure often derives from the person 's  importance ,  God the father never being small .  A perspective may be used which reverses the convergence of lines in the distance ;  instead ,  lines of perspective converge in front of the viewer ,  an unexpected phenomenon for a twentieth - century spectator used to photographs .  Again , in Chinese art perspective is <head>different</head> from its treatment in the West . There is one sort of Chinese perspective ,  seen as in the West from a level viewpoint ,  but this is only one of three treatments of space representation .  It can be identified with p'ing yuan  ,  when one is able to see from the near parts to the furthest parts .

The point of making these comparisons is that artistic practices affect how a critic should describe a landscape .  Suppose a scene is said to be in correct perspective ?  This description could mean several <head>different</head> things . Yet such a comment may need to be made ,  nevertheless ,  to point out the quality of a picture .  The critic who pays little notice to perspective or other means of representing the natural world will deprive a reader of help in enjoying the exceptional beauty of the natural appearance of Impressionist pictures ,  whose qualities are inspired by scientific understanding of light and its effects .

Perhaps this is the more important in the late twentieth century now that this means of image - making is so familiar that some people actually imagine that a photograph shows the world as it is .  In truth ,  the camera is a ruthless editor of visual information ;  this can be made plain by looking at a picture ,  say of the eighteenth century ,  and comparing it with a contemporary print ,  perhaps an aquatint ,  and a modern photograph .  The images carry <head>different</head> information . The physical make - up of dots in a photograph differs from the lines and granular surface of the aquatint ;  the aquatint 's  variations describe the picture more eloquently .  The art of civilisations other than that of the West are now more readily visible through photography ,  and within the limitations of the medium ,  usefully so .

But the literal Levi is a writer who has his own way of interesting himself in the contrasts which have been attributed to Babel .

There must be some affinity between you and the man or woman on the printed page  something that you recognise not because you are just like that but because you feel that you can interpret the situation with those words .  Let us look at Romeo and Juliet  .

Bernard Shaw once described Romeo and Juliet  as the impetuous march of music ,  and if ever there was a play of rich language ,  this is it .  The music of the words is there to be used  but not at the expense of the sense and emotional content .

They can be reliably dug out again only by averaging over many presentations so that the random background fluctuations cancel each other out ,  leaving just the potential shifts that are linked in time to the triggering event .  Averaging of this kind was first done at the National Hospital in London in the 1940s by George Dawson ,  initially using a technique of photographic superimposition and then later a system of addition using banks of condensers ,  but it was the electronic processing and computing power of the 1960s and 1970s which made the accurate timing of these averaged potentials possible ,  resulting in a rapid expansion in ERP research .  Since then , correlations have been reported between potential shifts and a wide variety of <head>different</head> events , ranging from simple and complex sensory stimuli to whole sequences of behaviour or even internally generated mental events . It is now being claimed that the ERP allows the objective monitoring of well specified mental activities .  As Fergus Campbell has suggested ,  if the ERP can tell us whether or not the subject has seen a light ,  it takes the psycho out of psychophysics .

Some of these changes will be related to neural processes that have little psychological relevance .  Nor is there any reason to suppose that the peaks and valleys of the fluctuations have greater neural or psychological significance than any other intermediate point .  So sorting out what is going on in an ERP is like untangling a complex bundle of many <head>different</head> strands of similar wool with one hand tied behind the back . Given this ,  the progress that has been made is remarkable ,  particularly in relating components of the ERP to attentional processes .  Whether or not we perceive an event in the world around us  depends on three things .

In both cases it is the position of the lips that conveys much of the vital information .  If it is the simple physical characteristics of a stimulus that play the key role in generalizations about behaviour ,  then we might expect to find patients who have lost the ability to lip - read and lost the ability to judge expression ,  but not patients who have lost only one of these two abilities while retaining the other. According to the functionalist , of course , facial expression and lip - reading are likely to be dealt with by distinct parts of the information - processing system because the nature of the information that they convey is so <head>different</head> . Therefore the dissociation which Campbell and her colleagues have demonstrated between lip - reading and expression analysis makes perfect sense from a functionalist perspective .  Phenomenology

The basis of these unities does not seem to lie within the nervous system as it is currently conceived .

But the scattered activity of <head>different</head> parts of the nervous system seems to converge only at the cost of merging , and so losing , the components that come together in the process of convergence , rather in the manner of snowflakes joining a drift . There is no neurophysiological model of the kind of convergence that would seem to be necessary for the many different sensations of the moment to be brought into synthetic unity ,  without loss of their individual distinctiveness and specificity ,  into the instantaneous sense of being here ;  or of the manner in which experience of many different moments can be synthesized into a sense of continuing self without those moments losing their separateness in memory .  As for the recovery of consciousness ,  or wakefulness ,  there is no imaginable physiology of this light dawning over the whole .

I mean it 's  important but it 's  not the only important thing .  I 'm Irish and you 're my child ,  so you 're Irish .  You 'd have been born in Ireland if things , history and all had been <head>different</head> . She was on firmer ground again .  She hurried on .

He 'd expected it ,  he added ,  since he noticed that I had my own plate and cup at work ,  and bought tea for whoever was sitting with me .  I smiled ,  nodding my head ,  not unhappy that he 'd jumped to the wrong conclusions ,  but surprised that he did n't know the secret of paying by instalments .  He flung himself down on my bed , trying it out in <head>different</head> positions . How clean it is !  he exclaimed .  How comfortable !

The cutting head is a router with a variable speed control  ( 030,000rpm )  which is attached to the same shaft as a stylus .  As the stylus is moved over a pattern ,  the router duplicates the original .  Movement can be in any one , or a combination of five <head>different</head> ways , so allowing intricate shaping and undercutting with very little experience . A pattern can be almost any material ,  even plaster which has had a layer of sealer on it .  It is also possible to modify the original by adding or omitting parts ,  or even combining different patterns into one carving .

It is hardly surprising that there is confusion over the names and numbers which describe the shapes .  Not only does the cutting edge vary in shape ,  there are a variety of patterns of shanks ;  the metal behind the blade .  Just to add to the confusion there are also <head>different</head> types of handles . However it is not necessary to own all the available shapes ,  some have very specific uses which may only needed on rare occasions .  When a special tool has been developed ,  it is usually because nothing else will do the job as well .

The key to it is choosing the problem correctly .  Are you handling 8x4ft sheets of MDF or are you handling dirty great 12ft boards of ash or ,  like our friends the chair - makers in Harland ,  are your components hardly ever longer than 24in .  Given a large enough supply of machine catalogues and enough flexibility of mind to give yourself <head>different</head> problems , an inventive woodworker could spend the entire winter playing this game . Think of it as the woodworker 's  equivalent to Dungeons and Dragons .  There are ,  of course ,  several traps .

You see ,  when you are working in plan like this it is difficult to bear in mind that machine table heights can work in your favour and they can also work against you .  For example ,  if you have the situation where you want to put two occasionally - used machines quite close to one another ,  it may be to your advantage that their heights are exactly the same so the job can run across both tables .  The converse of this can apply if your table heights are at <head>different</head> levels . Most bandsaws ,  for example ,  have a table considerably above the common machine table height which may enable you to cast long jobs above other machines .  Most planer - thicknessers have a thicknessing table below common machine height ,  so position your thicknesser very carefully .

Most planer - thicknessers have a thicknessing table below common machine height ,  so position your thicknesser very carefully .  For instance ,  we know in our workshop if you want to plane and thickness timber for a solid wood dining table that is longer than 10 feet ,  we have got to do it somewhere else .  When it comes to choosing which machine to buy I would suspect that our requirements would be rather <head>different</head> from your own . This a busy commercial workshop .  Each machine is probably used by half a dozen different people every day .
