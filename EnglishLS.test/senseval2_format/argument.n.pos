Or ,  the effect of a painting may be compared with those of other means of communication ,  such as photography ,  film or television .  there is every reason to welcome such studies ,  though a reader hoping for judgements about quality may be disappointed by a theoretical writer 's  greater stress on interpretation .  Theorists may also be more difficult to follow in their <head>arguments</head> because of a current of polemic with which a reader may not be familiar . For example ,  the writing of Rosalind Krauss has mainly been published in two journals ,  the American October  and the French Macuba  ,  both advancing a special interpretation of twentieth - century art .  This stance is partly a reaction against what Krauss saw as a dominant position in American criticism ,  by which the art of the last hundred and thirty years ,  the art of modernism ,  is not being well served by writing that promotes the myths through which it can be consistently misread .

A difference between Morelli and Friedlander is that the former explains his method ,  while the latter does not. More than a hundred years have passed since Morelli started writing ;  in that time many problems of authorship have been solved ,  while about others tacit agreement has been reached .

Doubtless some protestant paramilitaries  though there have been fewer religious persons among them than in the case of the provisionals  hold to similar religious understandings of the necessity of violence under certain circumstances .  Covenant theology itself empowers the people to take action against the state in certain and specific circumstances ,  and Ian Paisley and many of his supporters both within and without the Orange order have frequently used bully - boy tactics ,  and approved paramilitary processions ,  marching ,  and drilling .  From Carson to Paisley one finds the <head>argument</head> that it is legitimate to fight to regain one 's fundamental freedom if the sovereign with whom one has covenanted one 's allegiance betrays that allegiance and conducts one into slavery . The argument is clearly inspired by a religious motivation and shows Ulster protestantism to be a vigorous form of political religion ,  approving whatever defensive measures are necessary to avoid submission to Rome rule. Ulster protestantism is not contained within churches but spills out on to the streets .

Despite what brewers '  architects often allege ,  the life expectancy of such plastic window units is proving remarkably short  as little as five years for the fittings ,  and twenty years for the plastic itself ,  which is exhibiting distinct tendencies to warp and discolour with age .  Thus the arguments for easier maintenance and greater longevity of plastic windows appear to have little foundation in fact an <head>argument</head> often ignored by the brewers . Given their prime location in the centre of towns and on major thoroughfares ,  Georgian coaching inns are frequently prime targets for refurbishment .

Most fieldwork is simply episodic ,  made by an outsider moving in for a period to assess observed social behaviour .  In this case ,  however ,  I have been unable to make the separation and the  fieldwork is both empirical and continuous ;  it is diachronic and retrospective ,  taking in the historical with the contemporary .  And as Mary Douglas ( 1973 : 15 ) had pointed out , if we cannot bring the <head>argument</head> back from tribal ethnography to ourselves , then there is little point in starting it at all . Like Douglas ,  I see no point in setting up a false theoretical dichotomy between us ,  and them ,  creating separate realms and polarities of modern and archaic thought ,  for I anticipate my inclusion of the concept of self can help link the tribalism which haunts the police defensiveness to an understanding of their modern beliefs ,  modes of thought ,  and action .  Hopefully this will allow the ethnography to extend on the interpretive analysis which Kuper  ( 1973 )  termed neostructural and which has since combined aspects of a feminist ,  semantic ,  and symbolic framework to generate what may well be a short - lived disciplinary ism of post - modern anthropology  ( Young 1989 )  .

At first sight this looks like an uninteresting stipulation about how to use the word fact  uninteresting because the anti - materialist could as well state his case using some such term as feature or aspect ,  and it is difficult to see how ,  once having allowed that there is something called what it is like to see which one only learns by seeing ,  one could refuse to describe this as a feature or aspect of mental life .

So perhaps my overkill misses the target :  perhaps the behaviourist analysis of perception is sound ,  even though a general behaviourism is not ,  and what BS lacks is not knowledge of the nature of certain mental states ,  but only the ability to respond spontaneously to visual stimuli ,  that is ,  to respond as a result of actually seeing them .  Reflection on the nature of the argument against behaviourism in general ,  however ,  reveals that the argument refutes the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular .  That <head>argument</head> showed that knowledge of the external world cannot be reduced to behavioural dispositions , for the very idea of a disposition functions only in the context of an unreduced grasp on the physical world . But there is nowhere else that we might get our conception of the physical world from ,  other than perception .  It is the content specifically of sense - perception that must be taken non - reductively ,  if the contrast required by our concept of disposition is to be maintained .

The situation would be different from this only if the internal discriminations carried with them some experiential feel that was not to be identified with some physical process of which BS could know .  But this is just what the physicalist cannot allow .  The second and more important point is that the general <head>argument</head> against behaviouristic theories does take in functionalism and is not merely directed against traditional behaviourism : it works against any theory that analyses one 's conception of the world simply in terms of the way one functions that is , behaves in the world . The addition of internal discriminations within the nervous system adds nothing relevant to this ,  unless the internal discriminations really possessed semantic properties ,  so that they somehow contained in themselves a real description of the world .  But it is accepted by physicalists of all kinds that the meaning  or semantic value  of internal states must be analysed in terms of their causal relations to stimulus and response ,  just as it is for the behaviourist 's  dispositions ,  and is not something they possess in their own right ,  or of themselves .

This predicament arises out of the demise of consciousness ,  when only consciousness ,  understood in a traditional way ,  can bring us face to face with ,  and hence give us any grasp on ,  the qualitative ,  as opposed to relational ,  properties .

This is not merely a very bare conception of the world , but <head>argument</head> supports intuition in pronouncing it an incoherent one . It reduces language to an uninterpreted formal system .

At the first ,  input - process level ,  we do not encounter philosophical problems in the classic sense :  these are problems of mental engineering ,  of cognitive science  in the current jargon .

For deconstruction ,  however ,  this erasure of the world is crucial .

In Bowie 's  words ,  Future sociologists of knowledge will no doubt study the mechanisms whereby an enfeebled Lacanism ' has come to loom larger within the intellectual life of a society than the original  ideas and texts .

Yet there are affinities ,  as Frederick Crews points out :  In Althusser 's  and Lacan 's  hands ,  then ,  both Marxism and psychoanalysis exchange an adaptive materialism for allegory .

Leavisism assumed that its rewriting of the canon had a once - and - for - all quality ,  so that it was inconceivable that anyone could come to admire Shelley again ,  though this is precisely what has happened under the influence of Harold Bloom ,  who is dedicated to overturning the Eliot - Leavis version of poetic history .

There are certain academic precedents ,  particularly the uncontroversial establishment in a number of universities of degrees in drama ,  which do work previously thought of as belonging to an English degree .

Not wanting to seem too negative ,  I have outlined ways in which the discipline of English as currently constituted might divide ,  to the benefit of both parties .  But knowing how the academic mind works ,  I am not optimistic about change .  As Noel Annan wrote in his life of Leslie Stephen : The ingenuity in <head>argument</head> , the subtlety in drawing distinctions , the dexterous prevarications , the imperative reasons for procrastination , perpetually bewilder and confound the novice in university administration . In this respect ,  at least ,  little has altered since the nineteenth century .  The most likely future is no overt change ,  with the discipline of English becoming less and less coherent ,  riven by feuds and revolts ,  but still presenting the external appearances of a large ,  well - established and respectable academic subject .

And so I think it is worth recalling what W.H. Auden wrote of Beerbohm in 1965 :  Greatly as I admire both the man and his work ,  I consider Max Beerbohm a dangerous influence  just how dangerous one must perhaps have been brought up in England to know .  His attitude both to life and art , charming enough in him , when taken up by others as a general cultural ideal becomes something deadly , especially for the English , an intelligent but very lazy people , far too easily bored , and persuaded beyond <head>argument</head> that they are the Herrenvolk . One may be amused  though not very  that after living in Italy for forty - five years Max still could not speak Italian ,  but such insularity is not to be imitated .

By SARAH HOGG The Chancellor is trying to convince his political audience that Britain 's  deficit  ( now running at close on 4 per cent of national income )  is not a problem ;  and to convince the markets not to sell sterling .  In both <head>arguments</head> , the next two weeks which include a probable German interest - rate rise and an unavoidable Conservative Party conference will be critical . If Mr Lawson can hold off a base rate rise at least until he can blame the Germans ,  that will make his political task a fraction easier ;  but not much .  The balance of payments is a circular identity of inflows and outflows ,  which must necessarily match each other.

If Mr Lawson can hold off a base rate rise at least until he can blame the Germans ,  that will make his political task a fraction easier ;  but not much .  The balance of payments is a circular identity of inflows and outflows ,  which must necessarily match each other. You can start the <head>argument</head> at any point on the circle . Viewed from one angle ,  a current account deficit is merely the necessary counterpart of a capital account surplus ,  and it is from this point that Nigel Lawson 's  defensive intellectual outworks run .  Britain 's  kind of deficit arises not because the Government needs to borrow ;  the public sector itself is in heavy surplus .

Why should a good deficit not get even better ?  The first reason the Chancellor gives is that there is some bad froth on the good deficit :  that is to say ,  evidence of excessive domestic demand .  This <head>argument</head> starts from a different point on the balance of payments circle , with the excess of imports over exports . Even here ,  something can be found to say for the deficit ,  as a safety valve for inflationary pressures .  But it still has ,  willy - nilly ,  to be financed by attracting capital inflows .

The rise is particularly interesting because it confounded expectations .  The Economist Intelligence Unit concluded in its World Commodity Outlook 1989 :  Short of climatic intervention  to which tea is less vulnerable than most other major crops  a continuation of the downtrend seems unavoidable :  we expect London auction prices to average 1/kg ,  or even less ,  in 1989 .  At the beginning of the year , however , the trend <head>argument</head> was much more plausible than it is today . World production of tea  ( black and green )  grew from 2.27m tonnes in 1985 to 2.34m tonnes in 1987 ,  and rose again in 1988 .

THE MAGAZINE Private Eye will have to wait two to three weeks to find out whether it has won a retrial on libel damages of 600,000 awarded against it to Sonia Sutcliffe ,  wife of the Yorkshire Ripper .

In his final <head>arguments</head> in the three - day hearing , Gavin Lightman QC , for the magazine , said that if a retrial was ordered it intended to subpeona the editor of the Mail on Sunday , Stewart Steven , and two senior journalists from the company in an effort to discover the truth behind a 25,000 payment to Mrs Sutcliffe . Mr Lightman claimed that if the jury which had awarded the 600,000 had known that Mrs Sutcliffe was not adverse to taking money for her story ,  the outcome could have been different .  He said evidence of private conversations between journalists of Associated Newspapers about the secret deal ,  and of Mrs Sutcliffe 's  deliberate concealment of The Mail on Sunday 's  actions ,  could throw completely new light on the case .

Both countries are being bled dry by the poachers who supply the ivory trade .  Both countries also enjoy the full support of Britain and the US  a point you chose to ignore .  The <head>argument</head> that a ban will drive ivory trading underground is plainly absurd , since up to 90 per cent of all ivory currently in trade has come from elephants illegally slaughtered by poachers . Nor can an ivory ban be compared to attempts to stop trade in alcohol or tobacco .  Nobody ever got high on elephants '  teeth .

Political persuasion was required to keep up the political momentum ,  and given the changing age profile of the electorate  many of whom had not been adults a decade ago  Sir Geoffrey warned :  We 've got to choose the style to match the mood of Britain .  He said the Conservatives had to win a reputation for being a listening party ,  showing a willingness ,  where necessary ,  to reappraise .  The party had to show that it was good not just at winning battles , but at winning <head>arguments</head> and friends . Sir Geoffrey said that at Labour 's  Brighton conference last week ,  hope had been nurtured that the Thatcher generation of voters ,  like youngsters offered a sickly - smelling cigarette at a party ,  will experiment as their elders did with the notion that Labour knows best .  We must be sure that they are alive to the evidence here ,  no less than in the East ,  that socialism does not work .

But ministers would almost certainly prefer such a green tax ,  designed to limit planetary damage ,  to be introduced according to international agreements ,  rather than by Britain alone .

Mr Patten said that , just as there was an overwhelming moral <head>argument</head> for prudent management of the economy , so there was also an ethical argument for prudent management of the environment .

Improvements in the handling of appeals The year had seen two separate and different initiatives .  The first was announced in a Practice Direction  ( 1989 )  1 WLR 281 ,  which provided for the much earlier delivery of skeleton arguments which would be studied by the judges before they sat to hear the appeal .  The primary purpose was to reduce the costly time spent on oral <head>argument</head> in so far as that was not necessary for the proper determination fo the appeal . It was too early to reach firm conclusions as to the direction 's  effectiveness .  The need to monitor that experiment and the conviction that the court would benefit from improved lines of communication between it and those who used the court ,  either as practitioners or as litigants ,  had led to the establishment of a Court of Appeal Users '  Committee ,  representative of both ,  which would have its first meeting later this month .

Routine policing in Easton is the responsibility of the uniform branch ,  which is divided between organizational units known as sections and the neighbourhood and community relations teams ,  as well as the plain - clothes units like the CID and CDU  ( Crime Detection Unit )  .  Our attention was almost entirely focused on uniformed police ,  although some community relations work ,  such as juvenile liaison ,  is done out of uniform but was also within our brief .  Chapter 4 deals with community policing in its various forms , so that the <head>arguments</head> in this chapter and the next apply to routine policing by the uniformed sections . Easton station operates four sections  ( what in other police forces is called a relief )  ,  each working in turn one of three shifts ,  with the fourth week off .  There is a great deal of competitiveness between the sections ,  sometimes not always friendly ,  with each thinking itself the most efficient and best at policing .

Nothing much can be done about missing pets ,  but the impression of diligence and earnestness they leave with the bereft alone is a comfort .  In the occupational culture of Easton station most of these incidents are rendered afterwards into humorous stories ,  retold to new recruits and outsiders to demonstrate the funny side of policing ;  and the familiar RUC term all is regular ,  used to signify that a call has been attended to ,  has obvious humorous connotations for one of the community welfare tasks described here .  Another type is problem - solving calls , such as helping owners with injured dogs ( provoking enough interest for subsequent enquiries to be made about the dog 's progress ) ; giving impromptu lessons on road safety to young children who have narrowly avoided accidents ; and dealing with <head>arguments</head> between neighbours ( usually over noise ) and family disputes . Often the section police mop up the after - effects of problems ,  such as attending calls to fires ,  suicides ,  natural deaths ,  domestic disputes ,  and road traffic accidents .  The police on the British mainland do not attend many of these incidents unless a crime has been committed ,  but the RUC do so in order ,  as one said in relation to domestic disputes ,  to prevent crime .

The research design was not intended to display how ordinary Easton 's  police are as people ,  although the topics about which they talk show a concern with the same mundane things as other people  family ,  sport and leisure ,  television ,  sex ,  work ,  overtime and the bosses ,  the in - laws ,  friends ,  the cost of living ,  holidays ,  pregnancies ,  the house and DIY ,  politics ,  and so on .  But their ordinariness as policemen and women is indisputable .  The previous <head>arguments</head> have pointed to two ways in which policing in Easton is ordinary . Police duties in Easton are similar to those in non - divided societies ,  and the manner in which these tasks are viewed and accomplished parallels that elsewhere .  The routineness of police work in Easton is thus reinforced by the interpretative processes and practical reasoning that Easton 's  police share with policemen and women in other societies when doing routine police work .

Whale  ( 1977 ,  p. 80 )  has justified unregulated commercial control of the press by arguing that a newspaper controlled by a commercial group writes inhibitedly about a handful of concerns at most ;  a paper owned by the state ,  the effective alternative ,  would be guarded in its outlook on whole areas of the national life .  His critique of the alternative is more convincing than his defence of the status quo .  His <head>argument</head> is that newspapers may be inhibited about discussing the commercial interests of their proprietors but otherwise they exercise independent judgement . In particular there is anecdotal evidence to show that they are willing to expose the faults of other companies ,  including those that buy advertising space in the paper .  But Whale is wrong .

The partial recovery of the economy after 1983 was to show that some of it was misplaced ,  and that fears about national ungovernability and inability to adapt were ill - founded .

The arts continued to flourish , amidst growing <head>argument</head> over the role of the Arts Council , the right balance to be struck between the metropolitan and the regional , and between private and public funding . British higher education remained another source of national pride and complacency ,  with the high international standing of British universities and polytechnics generally assumed ,  even though the  differential fees imposed on overseas students in Britain ,  first by the Callaghan government ,  and later by the Conservatives after 1979 ,  somewhat eroded this appeal .  Above all ,  there was a general belief that ,  after three decades of social welfare and redistributive taxation ,  the spirit of Beveridge and fair shares was not dead ,  and that Britain was a far more equitable society than before the war ,  with more genuine opportunity for different classes and races .

Mrs Thatcher 's  international stature also rested on the curious chemistry of her relationship with President Gorbachev of the Soviet Union ,  but the rigour of the Prime Minister consorted somewhat uneasily with the fluid world of perestroika  ,  democratization throughout eastern Europe ,  German reunification ,  and moves towards international disarmament .  It seemed ,  in the wake of rival expulsions of alleged spies from London and Moscow ,  that Anglo - Russian relations were not as buoyant or as important as the British Prime Minister had claimed .  Meanwhile in the European Community , even with old <head>arguments</head> over the budget and farm policy removed , the British government looked like a somewhat negative force . The Prime Minister argued strongly against any form of federalism that would undermine the sovereignty of the nation - state .

The worms in Lucretius explanation of inflation works as follows :  a trade union ,  because of its bargaining strength with monopoly powers ,  secures an increase in the remuneration of its members ,  say ,  5 ,  10 ,  15 per cent  what they call excessive or unjustified .  Then ,  says the theory ,  this naturally causes all the other wages and prices to go up too .  Now , the beauty of this sort of explanation , where you have everybody on your side , when you are dealing with somebody who is unpopular , when you are all desperately anxious to find a scapegoat , is that your <head>argument</head> is unlikely to be at all jealously scrutinised .

So it is ,  say I in my simplistic fashion ,  that the plain ,  screaming absurdity of the statement that trade - union action causes a general rise in wages and prices escapes scrutiny .

The attribution or assumption of this identity marks the creation of the homosexual .  Alan Bray and Jeffrey Weeks have given historical support to this view ,  though not without qualification ;  I remarked in Part 1 some further reservations .  Additionally , we should recall that , before the nineteenth century , the meanings of terms like sodomy and buggery might have been even wider than is suggested by Foucault 's <head>argument</head> . Sodomy was associated with witches ,  demons ,  werewolves ,  basilisks ,  foreigners ,  and  ( of course )  papists ;  and it apparently signified a wide range of practices including prostitution ,  under - age sex ,  coitus interruptus ,  and female transvestism .  Socially ,  sodomy was repeatedly equated with heresy and political treason ;  metaphysically ,  it was conceived as sexual contusion in whatever form ,  a force of anarchic disorder set against divine Creation ,  not a part of the created order but an aspect of its dissolution .

In a bizarre and disavowed way this antiquated pseudo - scientific theory of male and female sexuality might usefully recall something remarked more recently by Gayle Rubin ,  namely that modern sexual difference theory ,  far from being an expression of natural differences ,  actually involves the suppression of natural similarities  ( Traffic in Women ,  179  80 )  .  But it is not my intention to rehabilitate this theory ,   or to suggest that it is allegorically preferable to current theories of sexual difference .  My <head>argument</head> does not even assume that it was a dominant way of thinking in earlier periods . Rather I cite it here as a historical antecedent whose very strangeness alerts us to several facts relevant to what follows :  first ,  and most obviously ,  that sexual difference is not a biological given so much as a complex ideological history ;  second ,  that current theories of sexual difference are of relatively recent origin ,  and quite probably still haunted by older views ,  including this one ;  third ,  it suggests that before sexual difference the woman was once  ( and may still be )  feared in a way in which the homosexual now is  feared ,  that is ,  not so much ,  or only ,  because of a radical otherness ,  as because of an interior resemblance presupposing a certain proximity ;  the woman then ,  as the homosexual in modern psychoanalytic discourse ,  is marked in terms of lesser or retarded development .

Compared to these two cultural moments ,  even the political revolutions and great wars in modern European history are ,  I would venture ,  of the surface  (  Real Presences  ,  101 ,  94  6 )  .  Steiner and Sontag are in a sense correct about the centrality of homosexuality to modern culture .  But the <head>argument</head> of this book is that its centrality is quite otherwise than they suggest . Steiner 's  ludicrous generalizations stem in part from the very notion of defining cultures and history in terms of a sensibility .  Even a cursory look at gay history and culture suggests that the sweep and conclusions of his argument are questionable at virtually every turn ,  as indeed is the very notion of a homosexual sensibility .

So when it is argued today that the sexual deviant challenges sexual difference by denaturalizing it through parody ,  the realization of the early modern transvestite that both the deviant and the difference are effects of culture rather than nature is being revived and sophisticated .  But a residual effect of the privatizing of sexuality ,  and in particular of the construction of sexual deviance as an identity ,  a pathology of being ,  rather than a kind of behaviour in principle open to all ,  is that the challenge to this construction often itself remains imprisoned by the public/private dichotomy .  So while the whole point of the <head>argument</head> , and rightly , is that when gender is understood as culture rather than nature we see that gender is implicated in all aspects of culture , in practice the argument rarely gets oft the bed . As we shall see shortly ,  the way out of the bedroom is via the wider cultures ,  rather than the specific sexual acts ,  of transgressive reinscription  for example ,  the writings of Wilde ,  Genet ,  and others ,  the subculture from which they emerge and help to form and transform .  First there is another objection to be considered :  do deviant identities and sexualities really denaturalize through theatrical parody as straightforwardly as is sometimes suggested ?

There is a long list of sacked ministers who have objected to her style .  Sir Ian Gilmour mourned the downgrading of Cabinet government .  David Howell complained that in Cabinet there was too much <head>argument</head> and not enough discussion and regretted the trend towards a huge argument where tremendous battle lines will be drawn up and everyone will be hit on the head . After the damaging Westland affair and the loss of two senior Cabinet ministers ,  there were even Conservatives who thought that it might be time to change the leader .  In its aftermath Mrs Thatcher apparently took greater care to consult the Cabinet more fully and was overruled by it on the proposed sale of British Leyland to the US - based General Motors .

The King could reasonably take the view that he was doing no more than exercising the right to encourage ,  one of Bagehot 's  famous trinity of rights ,  and that he was encouraging his Prime Minister in achieving his aims ,  rather than pressing MacDonald to adopt a course which was unwelcome to him. Moreover ,  there was a case for suggesting that the change of ministry in August required the endorsement of the electorate .  This was the <head>argument</head> voiced by The Times on 8 October : The working of parliamentary institutions , of democratic responsibility , and of constitutional practice , demands it . And ,  since the King had played some part in securing the formation of the National Government in August ,  the election would ,  in a sense ,  validate the King 's  action as well ,  Of course you are going to vote ,  the King said to Sir Maurice Hankey ,  the Cabinet Secretary ,  on 2 October ,  before the Cabinet had alighted upon the doctor 's  mandate formula which made the election possible .  When Hankey explained that ,  since the war ,  he had rather made a point of not voting ,  to emphasize his detachment from Party politics ,  the King replied ,  But this time it is different .

( This point will be returned to below .  )   The debate on overseas government expenditure in the crucial period leading up to the sterling crisis of 1947 can be characterized ,  in broad terms ,  as a battle between Dalton and Attlee on the one side ,  and Bevin and the service chiefs on the other. However , Attlee 's position was a complex one : he was more ready than anyone to criticize strategic <head>arguments</head> used to justify such expenditure , but was never willing to push the arguments to the extent of causing a serious rift with Bevin , who was perhaps the key minister in the government after Attlee . When Keynes 's  memorandum was discussed in Cabinet in February 1946 ,  defence expenditure for 1946/7 had already been cut by 14 per cent .  But there was a marked reluctance to accept that the situation was as serious as Keynes portrayed it  ( a portrayal broadly supported by a paper from the Balance of payments Working party )  .

There was ,  at this stage and in this forum ,  no discussion of the direct foreign exchange costs of those overseas commitments .  Attlee was not content simply to urge the need for economies .  He also challenged the central premise of the service chiefs ' and Bevin 's <head>argument</head> : the belief that the Mediterranean was absolutely crucial to Britain s international position . He hoped that the strategic assumption that it was vital to us to keep open the Mediterranean and that in fact we could ,  should be re - examined .  He did not see how we could possibly do so under modern conditions .  ' The ensuing debate encapsulates much of importance in the evolution of overseas expenditure in the early years of the Attlee government .
