Hamadi Jebali 's  sentence was confirmed on 6 March 1991 by the Cassation court .  This is the only court of appeal for cases tried by the military court ,  and looks only at points of law and not at facts and findings ,  thus providing a restricted appeal .  In October 1990 , Hamadi Jebali , who is a member of the executive council of Hizb al - Nahda , had received a six month 's <head>suspended</head> sentence and a fine of 1500 dinars for publishing an article entitled The people of the State or the State of the people ? in Al - Fajr in June 1990 . This sentence may be added to the new one - year term .  Please send courteous letters appealing for his immediate and unconditional release to :

has brought together ,  accumulated and assimilated by means of the physical materials of his art a host of desires ,  intentions ,  and conditions coming from all regions of his mind and being .  Sometimes he was thinking of his model ,  sometimes of the mixing of his pigments ,  his tone ,  his oils ;  sometimes of the flesh itself and sometimes of the absorbent canvas .  But , though independent , these objects of his attention coalesced , inevitably , in the act of painting when all the discrete , scattered moments , followed up , caught on the wing , <head>suspended</head> or elusive , were in process of becoming the picture on the easel . Even such richness may not be enough for a theoretician .  Victor Burgin explained ,  for example ,  in The End of Art Theory  that he was unwilling to be limited to an aesthetic response to the art object  ,  which in turn is representative of the sensibility of the artist .

Not only does seeing a chair as a three - dimensional object have this character ,  but so does seeing one line as longer in the Mulier - Lyer illusion  ( in which two lines of equal length look unequal when differently slanting lines are drawn at the tips )  despite our knowing that the two lines are really the same length .  Visual illusions are an excellent illustration ,  in fact ,  of the division between a  specialized and autonomous mechanism for seeing and the cognitive system which determines whether we should believe what we see ,  as Helmholtz pointed out over a century ago. We can disbelieve the evidences of our senses , we can <head>suspend</head> disbelief , as well as believing the world is such - and - such with no sensory evidence at all . So ,  to introduce Fodor 's  terminology ,  the mechanisms for delivering up packaged information about the world  ( a parsed sentence ,  a representation of a three - dimensional object )  he calls the input systems  .  What I have been referring to vaguely as the knowledge system ,  Fodor calls the central systems  .

Political balance cannot be achieved by criticizing one party during the mid - term of a parliament and another at election time .

Mr Badran ,  who was seeking a vote of confidence from the newly elected parliament ,  said :  I announce that martial law is now considered frozen until such laws are constitutionally abolished in the near future .  Under martial law , which was imposed by King Hussein after the 1967 Arab - Israeli war , freedoms have been restricted and the Jordanian constitution was practically <head>suspended</head> . Almost all candidates in last month 's  general elections ,  which were also the first in more than 22 years ,  called for lifting of martial law and defence laws and demanded the freedom of the press ,  freedom of association ,  and the legalisation of political parties banned by law since 1957 .  Almost all aspects of life suffered under martial law which was used by consecutive governments to ban large public meetings and to crack down on any political groups and political parties working underground .

A spokesman said staff at two divisional centres , New Malden and Bromley , agreed to the instruction but seven at Ilford and 21 at Kenton were <head>suspended</head> . He went on :  They are normally engaged in planning non - emergency journeys but since there have not been any it was felt that they have just been sitting around socialising when others are working long hours .  This was considered unfair and they were stood down.

Many of the 55 defendants arrested or convicted by the squad since 1986 who have made formal complaints to the inquiry team are black .  It is understood there may also be evidence of discrimination against Irish suspects .  At least four of the 55 members of the squad <head>suspended</head> pending the investigation , took part in the inquiry which led to the conviction of the Birmingham Six . If allegations of discrimination against Irish suspects were sustained ,  the pressure on the Government to re - open the Birmingham Six case would be intensified .  The question of racial discri mination was first raised in correspondence between Mr Michael Day ,  the chairman of the commission ,  and Mr Francis Petre ,  his counterpart at the complaints authority .

One witness had disappeared ,  two more had been intimidated ;  doubts were aroused about the ANC 's  commitment to the rule of law. Mr de Klerk is making progress ,  but towards what ?  The basis of the new accord is the agreement of last August , whereby the ANC undertook to <head>suspend</head> its 30 - year armed struggle and related activities . Did those words imply a halt to recruiting and training guerrillas ,  as well as to shooting and bombing ?  The government insisted that they did .

Unless this business is settled ,  the Americans are unlikely to agree to a Bush - Gorbachev summit .  Americans were bothered not only by the Baltic crackdown in January but by the Soviet reaction to American complaints about it .  These complaints were pretty mild , and aid was not <head>suspended</head> . But the Soviet foreign minister ,  Alexander Bessmertnykh ,  called America 's  reaction to the bloodshed purely emotional ,  and gave warning that Soviet - American relations were in a fragile state .  In March Mr Gorbachev himself remarked on this supposed fragility .

Hammersmith 's  auditor has argued in three courts that the deals are not enforceable ,  since councils had no power in law to engage in such deals .

On January 24th the law lords annulled not just Hammersmith 's  swaps ,  but more than 1,000 others arranged between banks and 130 councils over the past nine years .  Banks are aghast .

Such cases are not trivial .  They are nonetheless a big comedown from the 1960s ,  when federal trustbusters took on giants the size of ATT and IBM and broke up a merger of Procter  Gamble and Clorox .  They also sit oddly with the vow of federal trustbusters to put an end to the years of neglect when President Reagan virtually <head>suspended</head> the nation 's antitrust laws by cheerfully failing to enforce them . And they sit uncomfortably next to the strident calls for antitrust laws and enforcement to be relaxed in order to help American firms take on Japanese and European rivals .  When they are accused of timidity ,  trustbusters bristle .

The second field of investigation was mesmerism .  Sleep had always been regarded as being in some way analogous to death ;  the hypnotic trance was seen as having aspects of both conditions .  If , under its influence , normal physical functions could be <head>suspended</head> , perhaps the hand of death , too , could be stayed . This was the theme ingeniously exploited by Poe in his tale ,  The Facts in the Case of   M. Valdemar  ,  in which a semblance of life was related as having been preserved in a man mesmerised when at the point of death .  The story ,  published in the USA in 1845 ,  was reprinted in England as a pamphlet with the title ,  Mesmerism in Articulo Mortis  ,  and was widely held to be an account of a real experiment .

The nylon stocking was still <head>suspended</head> from a constricting girdle of unyielding firmness , a fortification virtually impossible to bypass without active collusion , and preferably plenty of time . Unpremeditated impulses were often frustrated by such hurdles .  The frustrated resorted to petting as a substitute .

There was talk of developing a clean bomb with little fall - out ,  a chimera at that time ,  which simply produced a lot of Carbon - 14 which does not decay for literally thousands of years .  But by August 1958 both sides realized that world opinion was turning against them ,  partly as a result of the scientists '  warnings ,  partly out of revulsion and fear ,  partly because nuclear disarmament had begun to be a popular political issue  and nothing makes a politician have second thoughts faster than the awareness that he might be losing votes .  So , after that year 's very comprehensive tests were finished , Eisenhower announced he would <head>suspend</head> American tests for a year , with extensions if the Russians and the British followed suit . The pause was to last for three years .  It was not as altruistic as it may have looked .

Frankie was an expert .  He hoisted the rope to the very top of the hill ,  leaped into space with his bare feet wedged against the big knot and soared like an eagle over the tree tops .  At its farthest point , that spot where he hovered high in the air before the rope changed direction , he knew that he was <head>suspended</head> sixty feet above Mucky Beck and the perimeter wall . The danger of killing himself in a fall was very real ,  but this was a fear he had learned to master ,  even to enjoy .  It was the unseen  ,  the quiet menace  that defeated him.

They were policy ,  but of a highly odd and experimental kind .  Large numbers of people had wind of them ,  indeed opposed them ,  but did not wish to admit that they even knew what was going on .  From the very beginning , therefore , witnesses to the operations and players within them <head>suspended</head> their disbelief . In this cloudy world ,  where so little seemed dependable or real ,  moral values were frequently suspended too .  This chapter investigates how that world appeared to the players and the lookers on ,  both at the time and afterwards .

Letter to the Editor :  Treaty sell - out SIR  Since Peterborough reported that the Maastricht Treaty was being sold by HMSO  ( March 19 )  I have been trying to obtain a copy without success .  HMSO says all copies have been sold and no more will be available as publication has been <head>suspended</head> on instructions from the EC . If the Danish Government was able to distribute 300,000 copies of the Maastricht text through newsagents and libraries ,  who has decided here ,  or in Brussels ,  that the British public should not be allowed to find out for themselves during the election what the small print of the treaty contains ?  If ,  as Lord Bruce of Donington points out  ( letter ,  April 2 )  ,  the new Parliament will be presented with a Bill before most members have themselves been able to read the text of the treaty ,  this is presumably in the hope that they will railroad it through before the British presidency commences in June.

Owen Teale 's  comic and original Hotspur brings much more to the part than the usual hellcat warrior .  Sylvestra le Touzel ,  his forbidding English wife ,  is in stark contrast to the Celtic sexiness of Lady Mortimer  ( Jane Gurnett )  ,  who gabbles away in Welsh under the paternal gaze of Bernard Kaye 's  Glendower ,  the crashing bore .  With a shrine <head>suspended</head> from the ceiling and with Jerusalem evoked in Henry 's opening speech , the guilty spiritual stain of Henry 's usurpation certainly makes itself felt amid the play 's comic carry - ons and pisspot humour . It is the sense of an England bloodily engaged in bashing out a national destiny from the tribal chaos which is best conveyed in this rich ,  poetic panorama .  It leaves you eager for the sequel .

The verdict of the commission is now legally binding .  Although the IAAF do have a three - month ban for minor offences like using ephedrine ,  manipulation of a test is equivalent to a fully - fledged steroid offence  a point Mr Emig twice missed during the proceedings .

Tormented by allegations of adultery ,  draft evasion ,  and venality ,  he has limped through to victory with an empty campaign ,  crafted to avoid giving offence to anybody .  Over a quarter of the votes went in protest to Mr Paul Tsongas , who had already <head>suspended</head> his campaign . Sixty per cent of Democrats still hope that a more substantial figure will be drafted to replace Mr Clinton at a brokered convention .  But that is wishful thinking .

The race is also being used by Poland ,  Mexico ,  Norway and Denmark as their trials for the Olympic Games and though the field is not so strong at the front ,  it looks to be a proving ground for the visitors ,  in an effort to beat times already set by their countrymen to enable them to go to Barcelona .  Among the Polish runners is Antoni Niemczak ,  their fastest competitor at 2941 ,  the fifth best in the race .  He was <head>suspended</head> for two years after he tested positive for drugs when finishing second in the 1988 New York race . Niemczak can compete in the London race ,  because the British Athletic Federation have lifted their ban on such competitors who tested positive and served their suspensions .  The women 's  race looks set for the second successive year to be at the mercy of Rosa Mota ,  a winner at Olympic and world level as well as the three times European champion .
