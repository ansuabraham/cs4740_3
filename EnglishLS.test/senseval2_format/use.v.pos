As this is over the inheritance tax threshold ,  it would bring a tax bill of 4,800 .  By leaving 5,000 to ACET ,  however ,  the taxable  value of your estate is reduced to 135,000 and this would give a tax saving  of 2,000 .  What form of words should I <head>use</head> for a legacy to ACET ? It might be helpful to take to your solicitor a form of words to cover your gift to ACET and we suggest the following :  To ACET of Paramount House ,  71/75 Uxbridge Road ,  Ealing ,  London W5 for its general purposes  ( one of these alternatives )  :  1 .

British Medical Journal  ( Source :  BMJ 1991 )  ;  302 :  2037 )  The cause of death figures are also changing beyond all recognition .  In 1986 , the classical pneumocystis pneumonia <head>used</head> to be the final event in the disease process in almost half ( 46 % ) of AIDS related deaths . While pneumonia continues to be a common occurrence ,  by 1989 improved treatment had reduced the numbers dying as a result to only 3 %   .  Instead ,  people are developing other problems are developing other problems such as cancers which give rise to the need for long - term community support .

The guards on the frontiers between art history and art criticism shoot neither intruders nor escapers .  Indeed ,  there are some who feel that there should be no border ,  thinking back nostalgically to days when there was only one domain of art .  In some writing today , too , it is possible to find the words critic and historian being <head>used</head> interchangeably . Art is after all the subject of attention for both critic and historian ,  even though the functions and methods of the two sorts of writer have drawn apart .  Fifty years ago they were in closer touch .

On Dada he wrote :  With robust iconoclastic  humor  the Dadaists mocked what they considered the sorry shams of European culture .  They even attacked art  especially modern art  but while they made fun of the pre - War Cubists ,  Expressionists and futurists ,  they borrowed and transformed many of the principles and techniques of these earlier movements .  Barr , in what <head>used</head> to be a general policy for museum curators , was not writing a passionate defence of the work his museum exhibited . Rather ,  the Museum does not intend to sponsor a particular aspect of modern art ,  but rather to make a report to the public by offering material for study and comparison .  Barr 's  European equivalents flourished in the 1950s rather than the  1930s  Jean Cassou at the Muse d'Art Moderne in Paris ,  Wilhelm Sandberg at the Stedlijk in Amsterdam ,  Pontus Hulten at the Modern Museum in Stockholm and then at the Pompidou Centre in Paris .

No prizes can be offered for pointing out that at a given moment there are artists of several generations working and in very different ways .  A further ,  and rather extreme way of dealing with a chronological survey of art is to eliminate the artists .  Art history without names was a phrase <head>used</head> by Heinrich Wlflinn , in his introduction to The Principles of Art History first published in 1915 . Wlflinn was Burckhardt 's  successor as professor at Basel ,  but his later successful career took him to Berlin ,  Munich and Zrich ,  a major art historian whose interests were primarily in the Renaissance and the Baroque .  Wlflinn was naturally not ignorant  of artists ,  but the famous phrase indicated an interest in the sequence of art seen as forms which develop as if of their own volition .

This extended critical evaluation is a rarity in a survey ,  but very welcome in the way it spells out a connoisseur 's  response in formal terms to a work of art .  It has the added value of being firmly rooted in a thorough understanding of technique .  Surveys of painting , it has to be admitted , are more fallible in this respect , partly because of the relative simplicity of the means <head>used</head> . Differences exist between the media of tempera and oil ,  or oil and acrylic ,  but they do not have the importance of contrasts in other material processes .  Nevertheless ,  there is one group of surveys of painting which have a special interest :  those which form part of handbooks or ,  more grandly ,  treatises on how to paint .

It is modestly titled About Prints  .  In it this English master printmaker wrote lucidly and well about the range of possibilities in his profession .  His memories of his Paris studio add spice to his account , for the facilities there were <head>used</head> not only by his students but in addition by such major artists as Mir and Picasso . The technical survey is above all a category of book in which the writer will have closely observed the material discussed .  This observation has direct bearing on questions of authenticity ,  since a detail may be the way that the true can be separated from the false .

Only dealers sell on the steps ,  while private owners prefer the more certain floor of a landing of clearly established prices for a category of work .  Correct descriptions are important to auctioneers ,  as can be exemplified by the coding used to list paintings .  This is the system <head>used</head> by Sothebys : ( a )  references to signatures ,  inscription and dates refer to the present state of the work ;    ( b )  the term bears a signature and/or date and/or inscription means that in our opinion the artist 's  name and/or date and/or inscription have been added by another hand ;   ( c )  the term signed and/or dated and/or inscribed means that in our opinion the signature and/or date and/or inscription are from the hand of the artist .  Such caution is prudent in a business where errors of judgement can be extremely expensive ;  at least the reader of an auction catalogue knows clearly what view has been taken by the cataloguer on a number of questions .

He is a writer of rare gifts ,  and among his gifts is a capacity to wound .  He had previously written a journalistic piece about the killings ,  in which De Freitas figured as shabby and contemptible ,  and Gail Benson as a silly upper - class woman whose accessibility to the knife might almost have been construed as a last desperate act of Sixties modishness :  an antic exported from Swinging London .  In a second article on the killings , Naipaul 's wife Patricia <head>used</head> the word antics to characterise the behaviour of the De Freitas set , which she firmly separated from the serious politics of the Caribbean . I knew Gail Benson slightly when she was a schoolgirl ,  and remember a pretty moon face ,  big eyes ,  a freckled complexion deepening to russet ,  dark hair parted down the middle  a nut - brown maid and modern miss who must have wanted to be away from the French Lyce in South Kensington ,  shy ,  uneasy ,  wound - up. I was curious to see what shrift she would receive in Naipaul 's  novel :  the work of a man who has been spoken of by an old friend ,  the novelist Paul Theroux ,  as having in earlier times been merciless ,  solitary ,  and  ( one of his favourite words )  unassailable .

The airmail letters which he exchanges with his liberal friends in England tell a worse story of them than they  do of him ,  and hark back in fine style to that golden time when such friends used to kneel in London mosques with Michael X and other celebrities ,  squinting up at the Heavyweight Champion of the World 's  effulgent arse .  Jane is unlikely to earn much sympathy by virtue of the attention given to the environment which produced her dabbling in eventfulness and her poor kiss ,  and yet the two environments have more in common than would once have been thought possible .  It is a quite Caribbean Britain that has made her : a Britain at the end of the world which it <head>used</head> to rule. Ahmed 's  revulsion from Jane sometimes seems to be shared by the writer .  It is possible to think that this plebeian has been lent some part of Naipaul 's  aristocratic fastidiousness ,  some part of his hostility ,  while also suffering the consequences of an exposure to these qualities ,  and to recall that both Ahmed and the author of An Area of Darkness  are preoccupied with the hanks of human shit that litter certain landscapes .

It should not be despised ,  Bombay talkies ,  any more than Mizoguchi despised the melodrama he took from the Kabuki theatre .  On the contrary ,  it offers great possibilities .  Here too , Ghatak made use of Jung in his thinking about popular culture , looking for ways of <head>using</head> psychoanalytic concepts , unconscious motifs and images , in order to affect the audience at a deeper , less conscious level than most committed film . At the same time ,  Ghatak believed in experiment ,  in the need for an experimental cinema .  He was interested in the work of Norman MacLaren ,  the Surrealists ,  Godard .

Having saved the sports car company and turned himself in at the end of series one ,  Clive Owen led off the second series in 1991 completing the last days of a prison sentence and abandoning the city slicker lifestyle for a battle to save a bankrupt stately home .  The producer ,  Sarah D Wilson comments the public and press reaction was so strong that we developed another seven programmes to conclude the story .  We had recently finished with the Douglas car company but wanted to keep the series topical and so developed a new setting in which our hero <head>uses</head> his amoral cunning to preserve part of Britain 's disappearing heritage . A success both in front of the box and on the critics '  pages CHANCER created a vogue out of a rogue  the identity of Stephen Crane  ( Clive Owen 's  role )  catching the attention of the country and reflecting the social changes in the early 90 's  as the enterprise culture began to take a tumble .  Leading the presentation of CHANCER will be Ted Childs  ( Executive Producer ,  Head of Central Films )  ,  Sarah D Wilson  ( Producer )  ,  Simon Burke  ( writer )  ,  Alan Grant  ( director )  .

The European Commission 's  MEDIA programme 's  main thrust is to enhance the strength of the national audio visual industries to member states by encouraging greater collaboration between them and wider distribution of their products .  Support is offered for script writing  ( European Script Fund )  ,  animation  ( CARTOON )  ,  independent production  ( EURO - AIM )  ,  independent producers  ( EAVE )  etc. All the MEDIA projects are run on the basis of offering limited seed money to be <head>used</head> as a means of attracting further funding . This will be the first time that an introduction to the range of MEDIA initiatives will have taken place in the city .  Lori Keating ,  who was the MEDIA programme UK press consultant in 1989 ,  and who now heads up Mediation UK ,  will be the seminar 's  main speaker .

Jeff still rates as one of the nicest people I have ever met .  The boys all liked him ,  too  and some of them resented being placed under my care because of the fun they knew they could be having next door .
