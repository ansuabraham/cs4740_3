A sense of mystery and futility is imparted by events at the Grange and on the Ridge ,  and that sense is heightened by what takes place in the city when the party catches fire and rioting breaks out .

On this occasion she is at a posh <head>party</head> , where she has taken a glass of champagne , but only to be sociable a motive which in anyone else would have driven Patrick to contemplate another of the umpteen blows he feels like unleashing when the novelist unleashes one of his phonological jokes , which play on vagaries of pronunciation . A man ,  back from Spain ,  addresses her in tones that approximate to what the Independent  thought was the well - educated voice ,  and to what the Guardian  thought was the assured accent ,  transmitted by the Intelligence chief responsible for the shooting of the IRA bombers in Gibraltar which preceded the arrival of the novel .  Jenny understands him to say that he has had trouble on his travels with the Reds .

1986 )  indicates a separating out of protestant and catholic ,  with the catholic population drifting westwards and vice versa .  The majority of the Roman catholic remnant in the North still believe in a united Ireland .  They demonstrate this partially by their support for the two nationalist <head>parties</head> , Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour Party , though support for the latter does not necessarily imply nationalism . Despite the official socialist tendencies of these two parties ,  a substantial number of their voters do not appear to question the maintenance of a capitalist - type class structure in a new Ireland .  The Workers '  Party still fails to command many votes in elections north or south of the border .

Up to the late 1960s ,  catholic nationalists were split between two main political groupings .  There was the Nationalist Party ,  a weak organization for which local priests had to provide some kind of legitimation .  As a <head>party</head> , it really only exercised a modicum of power in relation to the Stormont administration . Then there were the republican parties who focused their attention on Westminster elections .  The disorganized nature of catholic  nationalist politics was only turned round with the emergence of the civil rights movement of 1968 and the subsequent forming of the SDLP in 1970 .

Wallis ,  Bruce ,  and Taylor  ( 1986 )  list this mainly landed gentry among the cosmopolitans of Ulster society .  Also cosmopolitan in outlook are a variety of traditional professions ,  particularly university lecturers .  Many of these moved their allegiance to Ulster 's alliance <head>party</head> on its foundation in the mid - 1970s . The limitations on the power of these liberal groups within protestant loyalism are demonstrated by the fact that they have only been allowed to function among the leadership of the people so long as they obeyed the basic tenets and values common to the alliance as a whole .  This is shown in the protestant  loyalist rejection of Terence O'Neill and O'Neillism ,  and of his successors ,  Major Chichester - Clark and Brian Faulkner ,  as prime ministers of Northern Ireland  ( 196874 )  .

One can also add that there is something in the present policies of the SDLP which suggest a need to maintain a somewhat fragile unity in respect of the national question .  Seamus Mallon ,  MP of the SDLP may have seen the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 as a step towards a united Ireland ,  but some of his co - politicians in the party would not share that view .  Perhaps one should note the care with which the present leader of the <head>party</head> , John Hume , chooses his words over the future of the North . He is careful not to promote the theme of reunification ,  but talks of discovering a new way ,  setting up structures of co - operation in the North between the two Northern Communities ,  with the support of the Southern government .  However ,  the policy is seen as ambiguous .

In both cases ,  democracy is invoked .  But it is the theory of democracy as the right of the majority to rule which is seen as central ,  rather than democracy as the preservation of minority rights .  In the North , the belief comes via the British parliamentary tradition of the two - <head>party</head> system and its accompanying electoral process of first pass the post . For protestant loyalists ,  the majority means themselves .  In addition ,  protestant  loyalist politics has always been a zero - sum activity :  one either has a monopoly of power or concedes it to the opposition .

Later the hierarchy made it clear that the basis for their objections was the increase in power by the state vis -  - vis  the liberty and self - reliance of its citizens which such legislation would entail .  Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the whole affair is the way Dr Browne handled it .  The members of his <head>party</head> appeared to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the earlier Bill , and Dr Browne only found out in October/November 1950 . When he was told of the hierarchy 's  opposition to any bill of this kind ,  Dr Browne ,  himself secularly inclined ,  submitted his proposals and arguments to the hierarchy for approval ,  just as a previous Health Minister ,  Dr Walsh ,  had consulted Archbishop McQuaid on a similar matter in 1946 .  If a man of such convictions felt it necessary to follow this course ,  how much more would have his religiously  devoted colleagues .

In reality only the major nationalist parties participated .  Loyalist <head>parties</head> refused to join in , and the Provisional Sinn Fein was excluded by the fact that the ground rules for the forum only allowed parties accepting constitutional , nonviolent politics to participate . The forum completed its consultations and reported in the Summer of 1984 .  There was one vital breakthrough for the nationalist consciousness ,  though there still remains some doubt as to how deep this was for the Fianna Fil party :  all the parties committed themselves to the recognition of the protestant  loyalist group as having legitimate aspirations and affirmed the need for the recognition of two sets of legitimate rights coexisting in the island as a whole :  Constitutional nationalists are determined to secure justice for all traditions

The speech of Dr Woods of Fianna Fil was a particularly important intervention .  It indicated that Charles Haughey in particular ,  and Fianna Fil in  general were moving behind the anti - divorce lobby .  One might be forgiven for thinking that the bishops letter had something to do with it and that Haughey was intent on constructing an alliance between those heeding the teaching of the hierarchy and the <head>party</head> faithful . In early May ,  two - thirds of Fianna Fil TDs from the West had already indicated they would campaign in their constituencies against the amendment  (  Irish Times  ,  2 May 1986 )  .  The Woods '  speech also introduced an important new argument which may have had some considerable effect on Irish voters .

The first few times ,  the pup gets his food for free to demonstrate to him that people are nice ,  but after a few treats he has to sit for his stranger and for his supper .

The most common reason why so many families come to such a harsh decision is because their dog has behaviour problems they ca n't control .  It is far easier to prevent behaviour problems from developing than it is to correct them once they have become entrenched habits .  By providing patients and their owners with organised puppy <head>parties</head> , I can save more lives than I will with drugs or scalpel . This case is one which emphatically supports the old axiom :  Prevention is better than cure .  SCRUFFS

In this situation ,  the question had to be raised :  can a radically different work still be carried on under a single heading or department when there is not just diversity of approach but more serious and fundamental differences about the object of knowledge  ( despite overlapping of the actual material of study )  ?  For reasons which are much more pragmatic than ideological , I have come to think that a separation of Cultural Studies from English , though not easy , would be the least damaging way forward for both <head>parties</head> . It would represent a realignment within the humanities ,  not a diminution of them .  Cultural Studies would be visibly plural and fragmented ,  involving the study of literary texts ,  alongside others in history ,  philosophy ,  politics ,  sociology ,  film ,  and other disciplines .

Few want the wholesale repeal of industrial relations legislation .

They see themselves exercising the restraining ,  moderating role they played in the 1940s and 1950s .

Perhaps unwittingly ,  the new statue hints at a deeper truth underpinning the hardline triumph :  the worker ,  the peasant and the intellectual gaze wistfully towards the Forbidden City ,  the grandest monument to the genius of Chinese civilisation ,  but the soldier has his eyes fixed in a different direction  down the Avenue of Eternal Peace towards Zhongnanhai ,  the walled compound where party leaders live and work .  For as Mao decreed ,  if power grows from the barrel of a gun ,  it is the party that must control ,  and if necessary use ,  that gun .  Four months after the People 's Liberation Army stormed central Peking with the loss of hundreds of lives , few can have any doubt about the <head>party</head> 's determination to enforce this Maoist maxim . As many as 100,000 soldiers are still encamped around Peking .  Soldiers stand guard on street corners and roam the city at night .

Imitating the students ' tactics , the <head>party</head> has ordered shops and houses be strung with banners praising the great and glorious Communist Party of China . And ,  again like the students ,  it has issued an official list of permitted slogans ,  ordering citizens to memorise 40 different chants to mark the 40th anniversary of communist rule. Not as stirring as the protest movement 's  shouts of long live democracy ,  down with autocracy ,  they include cumbersome chants hailing the great achievement of socialism and warmly hail the victory over the turmoil and counter - revolutionary rebellion .

Bruce Kent ,  chair of CND ,  was cheered when he declared his belief that nuclear weapons did nothing for Britain 's  security .  They are suicidal and nuclear threats by anybody are wicked .  But he maintained that was not the purpose of the composite he moved on behalf of the Tottenham constituency <head>party</head> . It aimed at reducing defence spending to the European average and transfering the savings to the health service ,  pensions ,  housing and education .  If we pass this policy we can save at least 5bn to help to put this country on its feet again and to make decent lives for ordinary people possible ,  he said .

Supporting the review ,  Tom Burlison ,  northern regional secretary of the GMB general union ,  said the public would expect a Labour government to use whatever was the most effective means of eliminating nuclear weapons .  Let 's  have the courage to admit that there is no betrayal in providing the next Labour government with the scope to give Britain a leading role in a movement to a non - nuclear Europe ,  he said .  Martin O'Neill , the <head>party</head> 's defence spokesman , said the road to arms control now lay through the process of negotiation . It would require patience and a Labour government would have to continue to meet its obligations to Nato ,  to service personnel and to workers in the defence industries .  Most of all we cannot renege on our responsibilities to our own people ,  Mr O'Neill said .

By JOHN PIENAAR ,  Political Correspondent GERRY ADAMS last night discounted the anger and embarrassment of Labour leaders as he used a party conference fringe meeting to defend IRA terrorism ,  including the bomb attack on the Royal Marines at Deal ,  Kent .  The Sinn Fein president 's appearance , and the invitation of the unofficial Labour Committee on Ireland , was condemned by senior <head>party</head> figures , and was met with a candlelight protest by local Conservatives . Inside ,  about 12 demonstrators ,  believed to be National Front members ,  were ejected by police after attempting to disrupt the meeting .  Mr Adams scotched speculation that he might take up his Belfast West parliamentary seat ,  and use parliamentary privilege to overcome the broadcasting ban against Sinn Fein .

KEN LIVINGSTONE was yesterday knocked off Labour 's  national executive in a vote which took the Brent East MP and his left - wing associates by surprise .  The likeliest explanation of his defeat in the executive 's  constituency section vote is that party activists wanted to rebuke him for publicly rocking the boat during the passage of the policy review .  Robin Cook , the <head>party</head> 's health spokesman , who retained his executive seat by coming second , said the vote showed the degree to which the party wanted to elect people who devoted their energies to helping Labour to win the next election . Ken Livingstone 's  problem is that he is always on the television slagging the party off .  It may also turn out Mr Livingstone lost because more constituencies this year balloted their full membership ,  rather than leaving it to their activist general committees to decide .

His defeat gives a further boost to Mr Kinnock 's  already overriding executive majority .  The confirmed hard left on the executive is now reduced to two :  Tony Benn ,  and Dennis Skinner .  Mr Livingstone was replaced by John Prescott , the transport spokesman , who came third and said he would work for organisational and campaigning reforms in the <head>party</head> . He added :  Of course I 'll support Labour policy and the leadership ,  but I also believe constructive criticism has a role to play .  Mr Kinnock said he was delighted at Mr Prescott 's  election ,  adding he was a dear and close friend .

But Mr Kinnock 's  delight with the defence statement victory was marred by the successful left - wing rearguard action ,  calling for a cut in defence spending ,  initially to equal the average level of other West European countries .  Proposing the resolution ,  Mr Kent said it would mean a cut of at least 5bn  a quarter of this year 's  defence budget .  Before the debate , Gerald Kaufman , the <head>party</head> 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticised the resolution for its imprecision in not giving a time scale , and for ambiguity in not defining the precise level of spending required . He also warned :  I prefer it not to be carried because the Conservatives ,  who are desperately clinging at straws because of the popularity of our policy ,  against the irrelevance of theirs ,  would do what they could to make mischief about it .  In the event ,  the resolution was carried by a two - to - one majority .

A party spokesman then suggested that it would be ignored ,  saying :  Future levels of defence spending will be considered by a Labour government solely in the context of implementing the policy review .  In the debate itself ,  some of the behind - the - scenes tensions were reflected by party spokesmen attempting to discredit Mr Benn 's  contribution ,  pointing out that he had served in Labour governments which maintained nuclear weapons .  In spite of the setback on the defence spending vote , Mr Kinnock later scored a further advance with the results of the national executive elections , which saw Ken Livingstone replaced by John Prescott , the <head>party</head> 's robust transport spokesman .

However ,  co - operative agreements and alliances ,  which represent far less risk while still providing access to markets and information ,  are much more common than MA activity as yet .

The expectations of the two <head>parties</head> may be very different , as may be the amount of time and effort they each put into the deal . The enormous losses of at least 10m apiece that the big four securities houses ,  Nomura ,  Yamaichi ,  Daiwa and Nikko ,  made in the US in 1988 can be seen in two ways .  Either they show that the Japanese magic touch is concentrated mainly in manufacturing ,  or ,  more worryingly for the West ,  they demonstrate the costs of entry into unfamiliar markets that Japanese firms are willing to pay .

This was the first year since he became leader of his party six years ago that Mr Kinnock was relieved of his preoccupation with an ungovernable party and was able to turn his attention properly to the government of the country .  Hence ,  this was the first of his conference performances which was aimed primarily at the nation .  It was a severe test for him , for it is a widely held view that his talents as a <head>party</head> manager are not matched by his capabilities as a potential Prime Minister . How did he do ?  Not badly at all ,  given the immense difficulty of restoring credibility to Labour as a party of government .

As Mao 's  personal secretary and speechwriter for over 30 years ,  Chen was one of the Great Helmsman  's  closest confidants ,  writing countless tracts and playing a key role in the Cultural Revolution ,  Mao 's  catastrophic campaign to purify the Communist party hierarchy and revive what he imagined to be China 's  fading revolutionary ardour in the 1960s .  Born in the coastal province of Fujian in 1904 ,  Chen began serving Mao in Yenan ,  the remote village in northwest China where the Red Army took refuge and regained its strength at the end of the Long March in 1937 .  While holding no important posts within the <head>party</head> and often dismissed as little more than a colourless clerk of little talent by Mao 's colleagues , he distinguished himself as a devoted and tireless servant both of Mao and his new wife Jiang Qing qualities that would later prove far more important than any formal title . After the Communist victory in 1949 ,  Chen followed Mao to Peking ,  where he worked quietly and largely anonymously for nearly a decade .  But ,  as Mao grew increasingly suspicious of and isolated from more distinguished revolutionary veterans ,  he turned increasingly to his secretary for help as he tried to rally support for more radical ,  leftist policies .

In 1966 ,  however ,  when Mao began his dramatic bid for absolute power ,  using young Red Guards to discredit and persecute his old rivals within the party ,  Chen again rose to the occasion ,  acting as a mouthpiece for Mao 's  increasingly scrambled thoughts and policies .  Chen is even said to have written ,  or at least supervised at Mao 's  behest ,  the Cultural Revolution 's  best - known tract  an hysterical call to arms against counter - revolutionaries printed in the People 's  Daily in April 1966 under the title Sweep away all ghosts and monsters .  To carry out a wholesale purge of the <head>party</head> apparatus , Mao appointed Chen as head of the Cultural Revolution Group , a kitchen cabinet of loyal disciples , including Mao 's wife Jiang Qing , that was to lead the assault on the party hierarchy . The group was finally disbanded in 1969 ,  by which time China had been plunged into virtual anarchy and economic collapse .  Again forced to moderate his ambitions ,  Mao called in the army to restore order .

The group was finally disbanded in 1969 ,  by which time China had been plunged into virtual anarchy and economic collapse .  Again forced to moderate his ambitions ,  Mao called in the army to restore order .  During his nearly three years as effective day - to - day leader of the Cultural Revolution , Chen , along with Jiang Qing and Mao 's security chief Kang Sheng , helped orchestrate campaigns of vilification and persecution against thousands of <head>party</head> cadres , including the then head of state Liu Shaoqi , who later died alone in a bank vault used as a cell . In a move for which he would later pay ,  he called for the persecution of Deng Xiaoping ,  who was banished from office and attacked as second only to Liu as China 's  leading capitalist roader .  Perhaps still smarting from his lowly position and lack of respect in Yenan 30 years before ,  he publicly condemned Deng as arrogant and dangerously ambitious :  To discuss with Deng Xiaoping as equals is more difficult than to put a ladder against heaven .

The significance of the defeat on Monday of Ken Livingstone ,  Brent East MP ,  could only be calculated for the first time yesterday when the detailed voting figures were published .  The left - wing former GLC leader said yesterday that left - wing opposition to the leadership remained strong .  But he accepted that his defeat revealed a general reluctance in the <head>party</head> to see that opposition voiced too vehemently in public . Mr Livingstone argued that the move towards unity was merely the normal pre - election loyalty which the party usually showed ;  the only difference this time was that it was happening 18 months earlier than normal .  But the Labour Co - ordinating Committee said that there was clear evidence of a cultural change .

The policy review had produced relevant and practical answers that offered the kind of socialism the British people understood and supported .  It was the kind of socialism that insisted the NHS was not split up or sold off ,  that resented the injustice of the poll tax ,  and opposed the centralisation ,  control and censorship which had eroded civil liberties over the last 10 years .  He predicted the Conservatives would hit back with personal attacks on Labour leaders , by ordering civil servants to waste time trying to cost the <head>party</head> 's programmes and then , next week at Blackpool , with the Team . At the back of the stage would be the new Tory slogan  The Right Team for the Future .  Margaret Thatcher 's  team  that 's  a bit of confusion in terms is n't it .
