Most have been convicted since 1988 under Indonesia 's  sweeping Anti - Subversion Law ,  accused of attempting to establish an independent state of West Papua .  Amnesty International believes that their trials were unfair .  The <head>organization</head> has already adopted two of the prisoners as prisoners of conscience and believes that some 80 others may be POCs . Among the possible prisoners of conscience are 37 people sentenced to up to 20 years '  imprisonment for their involvement in a peaceful flag - raising ceremony in the town of Jayapura on 14 December 1988 .  A woman alleged to have sewn the flag was sentenced to eight years in prison and her husband ,  who led the ceremony ,  to 20 years .

Sadly ,  one thing has not changed in 30 years :  certain governments of the world still falsely imprison ,  torture and execute their citizens ,  regardless of internationally agreed standards that expressly forbid such abuses .  Around the world today ,  more than 100 countries still retain the death penalty ,  and two out of every three human beings live under governments that use torture and other cruel ,  inhuman and degrading treatment against them .  For this reason the campaigning elements of the <head>organization</head> and that includes many of the 80,000 British members who undertake to be active on Amnesty 's behalf have increased and refined their methods over the years . In practical terms this means that  although letter - writing to governments regarding prisoners continues to be the cornerstone of the campaign work other methods have been introduced to enhance the effectiveness of the hundreds of thousands of letters that Amnesty members write each year .  The Regional Action Network illustrates how campaigners have refined their methods .

Based in the Sinhalese south of the island ,  the Mothers '  Front has nonetheless stated its intention to embrace those affected by the thousands of disappearances in the Tamil - dominated areas of the north and east of the country .

The occasional independent unionist and independent Orange - lodge representative in politics were a feature of politics from 1880 to 1972 .  The Northern Ireland Labour Party also was the principal organization representing protestant trade unionists .  But none of these groupings ever came near to threatening the dominance of Unionist Party <head>organization</head> , much less the solidarity of protestant loyalists , which always appeared total on the issue of incorporation into a united , independent Ireland . It was only with the Troubles ,  from 1968 ,  that unionists  broke ranks .

What the protestant loyalists in effect seek to maintain is protestant  loyalist domination within a flexible territory ,  one which they feel justified in calling their land and ruling according to their conscience .  The Key Mythical Structures of Protestant  Loyalist Popular Religion It could be argued that the myths of Ulster protestantism and the institution of the Orange order take the place of the more centralized clerical <head>organization</head> of Roman catholicism in providing some element of overall religious unity among protestant loyalists . By myth is meant here what has generally come to be accepted within sociology and social anthropology since the work of Levi - Strauss :  an account of the origins of a society or of particular crucial events in its life ,  which unite the cosmos to the social structure by actively shaping everyday life perceptions .  The historical consciousness of Ulster protestants in this sphere is also a  faith consciousness .

Returning to academia he can recall the spatial remove as being out there in the field ;  so that much of the current anthropology at home may still only be practising in its own backyard ,  pursuing an exploration of exotic cultures at home rather than looking into its own front room  ( Cheater 1987 :  166 )  .  Sarsby ,   ( 1984 :  1301 )  echoing Cheater ,  points out that anthropologists have tended to study people whose values and life - styles are different ,  even in their own society seeking the unfamiliar at home as well as abroad .  An assumption remains inherent in the literature that anthropology is academically based , funded by some research <head>organization</head> , presented in seminar , taught to students , and then written up and published . It exists largely as a product of the institutions of higher education  ( Sarsby 1984 :  132 )  and has only recently begun to surface in policy and practice .  As Okely  ( 1987 :  67 )  observes ,  the urge to create publications is not always as crucial to others as it is to the academic .

It can be quite painful ,  for the insider is studying his own social navel ,  with the potential always present that he will recognize this to be only one of a number of arbitrary possibilities and perhaps also find that many practices are built on the flimsiest of moral precepts .  Such special knowledge holds further difficulties ,  for it highlights the specifically political nature of any ethnographic account  of such an institution ,  bringing to the forefront those expectations of loyalty which the executive demands of any individual who has hold of the account .  Ethical problems will surface , for no power - based <head>organization</head> likes to have its idiosyncrasies made public , and the anthropologist who is a member of the family and not merely a temporary visitor to the backyard exotica can find that writing anything at all becomes crucially problematic . Expectations of confidentiality and silence prevent many accounts from reaching fruition ,  for as the revelations of Spycatcher   ( Wright and Greenglass 1986 )  revealed ,  it is not necessarily what is written which causes the pain ;  rather it is the breach of the convention which requires members in various arms of the executive to say nothing about their practices .  This returns us to Arendt 's  observation that secrecy is a prerequisite of totalitarianism ,  for those involved in the executive use of power know that to reveal is antagonistic to its maintenance .

The observing participant insider is consequently torn between self and scientism ,  for he knows the strengths of an inculcated approval for quality of restraint which sustains the police mind .  It should come as no surprise ,  therefore ,  to find that most insider participant observation of policing is almost always confined to discussion on management techniques and to the implementation of new systems .  Philosophical reflexivity is not high on the agenda and in an <head>organization</head> which makes much of the concept of loyalty but really means subservience , the insider can find it hard to bite the hand that feeds and reveal any unhealthy aspect in the agenda . When the research is carried out by academics from outside ,  critical analysis creates enormous tensions .  Barrie Irving ,  director of the Police Foundation ,  indicated this antipathy in his title to a paper given to the British Psychological Society ,   Research into Policy wo n't go  ( 1983 )  .

As Crick  ( 1976 :  123 )  has argued ,  criminology  ( like anthropology )  ,  is largely concerned with systems of classification .  In consequence ,  police modes of thought build up into classifiable systems of praxis which are the product of dealing with the extremes of social experience .  These in turn become massively overdetermined , regenerative and self - justifying , creating an institutional mind which , although allegedly acting on behalf of society and the majority population , comes to regard that same group as outsiders and potential antagonists who are never to be accorded easy access to the processes of the <head>organization</head> . Such a world view is the product of a perception conceptualized to contend dramatically with the instant experience of dealing with highly emotive ,  personal conflicts at street level ,  or the tensions of ritual battles with criminals .  Inevitably in such circumstances ,  the detail of practice suffers a reduction to enable these charged and emotional situations to be handled more easily and to allow the complexities of social events to be reduced to the simplicities of narrative necessary for the file of evidence .

Police culture is omnipotent is structuring such views of critical research .  Historically it has homed in on sociology as the generic symbol of reformatory zealousness ,  regarding its practitioners almost as folk devils or bogeymen .  Such a view of sociology sets up another binary derived from the police preference for a Manichaean world created on homologies of good evil , and further reflects the ferocious resistance to and fear of change which permeates the <head>organization</head> ( see for example Weatheritt 1986 , Butler 1984 , and Adams 1988 ) . Certainly the social sciences are seen to be the arbiters of revolutionary change which might somehow dismantle the police institution and its processes ,  and this has led it to negate the reforming social scientists ,  keeping them as outsiders beyond the system .  A further example from the Police Foundation Oxford Conference gives some indication of the different perspectives which exist for the analytic researcher and the practical policeman :

For over a decade I lived with this new knowledge and with the ethical dilemma surrounding my own pursuit of insider research .  During the creation of a doctoral thesis and preparation of papers for seminars ,  I had to face the conscious problem of writing about a system which I know  prefers silence and links such reticence to ideas of respect ,  order ,  and discipline in an all - encompassing paternalism .  And of course I knew that this hierarchical <head>organization</head> offers the possibility of reward and incorporation into the highest ranks to those who conform to such dictates . The dilemma followed me through the publication of a few accounts of my researches .

One of the consequences of the RUC 's  dual role is that it has features typical of most police forces and qualities special to it .  This is reflected in the respondents '  sensitivity towards the police management ,  an enduring theme in the conversation of ordinary policemen and women in any force ,  and towards the terrorist threat ,  which is not faced by others to the same degree .  The latter makes what is already an internally homogeneous <head>organization</head> even more enclosed and protective . As one constable put it ,  I do n't mind you being here ,  I do n't mind you taking notes .

This declaration proved to be premature ,  although a recommendation that there should be a longer term for the candidate stage towards full party membership must have provided a useful mechanism for sifting the wheat from the chaff .

Indeed since eight of the eleven cell members were not peasants ,  they probably fell easily into this view of their own roles .

All local funds ,  which had been cut as a result of the introduction of NEP ,  were poured into famine relief .  There was even less money available for education after September ,  when many new famine duties and financial burdens were shifted from Moscow on to local authorities .

Churches ,  like the schools ,  were abandoned .

Eliot instances the activities of Dyak headhunters the production of whose carvings is at once a task utilitarian and sacred .

Eliot moves from such a primitive <head>organization</head> to discussing Greek drama , following the movement of Harrison , Cornford , and the other anthropologically influenced classical scholars whom he had read . He sees that conflict between various elements in highly developed society can be creative ,  but that eventually deterioration will follow if connections are not preserved between the various areas of life which ,  in the primitive model ,  are integrated .  Without naming names ,  he goes on to outline the situations which had so interested him in the cases of the Melanesians and the Tari Furora ,  as he points out that to tamper with the pattern of primitive culture at one point is to endanger the whole structure .

Fforde locates the rise of collectivism in the last quarter of the nineteenth century ,  equates collectivism with socialism ,  and views collectivism as symptomatic of the triumph of materialism .  All of this has a distinctly Diceyesque ring ,  for in the introduction to the 1913 edition of his Law and Public Opinion  Dicey portrayed any extension of state activity as socialist ,  and denounced the welfare collectivism of the new liberalism as an attempt to bribe the electorate with state benefits .  However , Fforde 's acceptance of Dicey 's basic agenda reveals the weakness of his central argument , a weakness which is confirmed by his comment that the LPDL , an <head>organization</head> with which Dicey had close links , espoused the pure milk of Conservative orthodoxy . Fforde 's  error  ( and Eccleshall makes the same mistake )  is simply that the orthodoxy which Dicey and his friends in the LPDL espoused was not Conservatism but classical mid - Victorian Liberalism .  It is true that Dicey ,  the LPDL ,  and later the BCA ,  allied themselves with the Conservative party ,  but this was not because they considered themselves Conservatives .

For example ,  Cortzee shows that contemporary tales of the tariff reform millions ,  are not borne out by the relatively impoverished state of the Tariff Reform  League ,  and he demonstrates that the variety of industries and economic activities which were represented in the TRL defy any attempt to produce a simple definition of its interest base .  On issues like this Coetzee 's  sensitivity and grasp of detail are shown to good effect :  but with regard to the broader historical significance of these organizations he is less assured ,  and he leaves untouched some of the more important questions raised by his work .  The leitmotif of Coetzee 's book , as suggested by his title , is that the <head>organizations</head> he has studied faced an ongoing dilemma : whether to function as adjuncts of the Conservative party or to claim that their aims were national and therefore above party . In fact ,  as Coetzee demonstrates ,  the personnel of the TRL ,  the NL ,  and the ASU were predominantly Conservative ,  and in this respect their claim to be non - party was always weak .  Yet Coetzee also makes clear that ,  for two reasons ,  the non - party idea should be taken seriously .

The Conservative  Party was thus preserved intact ,  and the fact that it was able to provide a rallying point for the middle and lower middle classes was arguably one of the main bulwarks against political extremism in the 1920s and 1930s .

The above argument is predicated on Coetzee 's assumption that the disruptive potential of the new <head>organizations</head> had been contained and that the crisis of Conservatism was over before 1914 . Yet it is not obvious that this was the case .  Between 1912 and 1914 the Conservative Party was distinctly unsettled .

Marx carried the criticism of Hegel 's  position much further ,  and he is equally critical of the young Hegelians .  He argues that ,  far from the State being the prime mover of history ,  the State itself is simply an aspect of a particular type of society .  What Marx meant by a particular society was an <head>organization</head> of people making a living together . In this perspective political reform of the State was therefore largely irrelevant since what had to be reformed was the complex order of which the State and law were only epiphenomena .  By arguing this ,  Marx therefore redefined the task of the revolutionary .

This Germanic organization remains extremely vague in Formen  and the reason seems to come from the paucity and dubiousness of Marx 's  sources for the construction of this mode of production .  In The German Ideology  Marx had used Tacitus as his source for tribal German society ,  but by the time of Formen  he became influenced by the nationalist and romantic nineteenth - century tradition of German historiography ,  a tradition which was to influence him even more later on ,  and which was to have a dramatic and harmful effect on Engels .  This tradition stressed how true Germanic society was still to be found in the <head>organization</head> of ancient local communities . It was egalitarian and free from the weakening and divisive influence of the Roman world and of urban society .  Within the local community it had survived during the Middle Ages and even to a certain extent right up to the nineteenth century ,  in spite of a foreign overlay of feudal institutions coming from western and southern Europe .

One very significant change from Morgan we can attribute to Marx .  Morgan 's  work is divided into four parts :  1 The growth of intelligence through inventions and discoveries ,  which deals in great part with agricultural technology ;  2 the growth of the idea of government ,  which is mainly a discussion of descent groups and how they ultimately give way to state organization ,  particularly the Roman state ;  3 the growth of the idea of the family ,  largely a discussion of types of marriage and types of kinship terminology ;  and finally 4 the growth of the idea of property .  Marx in his notes changes this order and brings the discussion of property forward into the discussion of descent groups and family <head>organization</head> , while he keeps the discussion of the rise of the State till last . This new order accords with the logic of Marx 's  thinking ,  as we have seen it in all the works we have discussed so far .  It also forms the basis of the organization of Engels 's  book .

There is however an implied point in the discussion of the gens which ,  I believe ,  is justified in all societies principally organized by descent group  ( though not necessarily all societies where descent groups merely occur as one among many other social institutions )  .  In such societies one does not find internal differentiation based on differential wealth ,  and if such differentiation appears to develop ,  it is resisted .  This means that in a very general way there is a contradiction between class <head>organization</head> and descent groups , and that this contradiction is actually perceived , though not in theoretical terms , by the members of societies based on descent groups . The exaggeration or over - simplification of the notion of commonality within the gens as regards ownership of property is also apparent in the discussion of kinship and this led equally to a fundamental misunderstanding .  In part Morgan believed that ,  in systems based on descent groups ,  spouses were held in common because ,  in such a society ,  people often talk of wives or husbands as having been married to such and such a gens .

He had not won an election ,  sung an aria ,  or even built up a business empire .

The most useful contribution he could make was to turn up on the right day in the right uniform ,  cut ribbons ,  and make cosy speeches .  When he did try to make some real contribution to society ,  it seemed that all he got for his trouble was The Prince was too sensitive ,  too intelligent ,  to play the part mapped out for him ,  the part that his courtiers were there to help maintain .

Here were people who shared his ideals and had the financial support of government and industry ,  while his endeavours had to rely on the begging bowl .  And here were people who wanted him not just for the name on the letter - head ,  but because they thought he could make a positive contribution .  Here , as it has turned out , was an <head>organization</head> where he has found he is seriously good at something , and where all the disparate strands of his life have come together with extraordinary clarity . The day you think I am not useful ,  he said to one of BitC 's  directors ,  tell me .  I want to be involved in the growth of something .

For Diana ,  coping with the life she had taken on ,  and with motherhood ,  was simply too much SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT When an <head>organization</head> invites the Prince or Princess of Wales to make a speech on their behalf , it is customary for them to write a draft , incorporating any appropriate facts and figures or particular message that they want conveyed in the speech . The Department of the Environment provided just such a draft when they invited the Prince ,  as the United Kingdom 's  patron of the European Year of the Environment ,  to open the Second International Conference on the protection of the North Sea in November 1987 .  It was a prestigious event ,  attended by ministers and top delegates from all over Europe ,  and the speech delivered to the Prince 's  office was straightforward and bland ,  essentially a pat on the back for Britain in all she was doing to keep the North Sea clean .

By that time DeFries had an office in Park Avenue which was very much like the old Gem offices in London .

A great many green ideas were produced by Labour that summer ;  a green bill to show up the deficiencies in Tory legislation ;  making the quality of life the central theme in the 1990 local elections ;  the mobilization of public opinion through the development of a network of environmental ,  countryside and energy organizations .  The Trades Union Congress weighed in with a Green Charter ,  which included the right to hold green strikes over issues like the importation of toxic wastes .  But by the end of the year the green bill had been quietly dropped and the environmental network had vanished into a general belief in the need for good , informal relations with Friends of the Earth and other environmental <head>organizations</head> . It was no longer necessary to upstage the Green Party ;  and it was becoming harder ,  too ,  to find a straightforward ,  easily defined green issue on which to challenge the Tories .  Mrs Thatcher had established her environmentalist credentials in several speeches and had replaced the true - blue but ungreen Nicholas Ridley with the practically viridescent Chris Patten as Environment Secretary .

The mood and issues of the 1990s are bound to be different from those of the 1980s .  Climate change is already more important than acid rain ,  genetic engineering a more topical issue than saving whales .  Changed issues do not necessarily throw <head>organizations</head> into an anxious state of transition ; if they are any good , they are always in transition . That certainly applies to the three biggest international green campaign organizations :  Greenpeace ,  Friends of the Earth and the World Wide Fund for Nature .  They continue to grow in size and influence and they appear to be still some way from peaking .

It has had ,  since its inception ,  an adversarial relationship with governments and its activists are not the sort of people with whom Conservative governments easily make friends ,  particularly when they block the outflow pipe of nuclear processing plants such as the one at Sellafield in Cumbria .  Greenpeace 's  cultural origins are Quaker .  It was founded in 1970 by two American Quaker couples in Vancouver , British Colombia , who fell out with the Sierra Club , the long - established American conservationist <head>organization</head> , over its cautious stand on nuclear power and its refusal to become involved in big international issues . They recalled that in 1958 Quakers had made an unsuccessful attempt to interrupt atmospheric testing of H - bombs at Bikini atoll in the Pacific .  The approaching US nuclear test at Amchitka in the Aleutians offered the chance of making a similar sea - borne protest .

Its population is approximately the same as Britain 's  but its Greenpeace has 600,000 members ,  double the British membership .  Looked at collectively ,  the green movements in Britain are already numerically impressive .  To coincide with World Environment Day on 5 June 1989 , The Times published a survey which showed that the membership of fifteen green <head>organizations</head> was climbing towards parity with the membership of unions affiliated to the TUC . If the current growth rates continued ,  it would be close to 6 million by 1992 ,  with the TUC at 8.8 million and declining .  It was an unfair comparison ,  of course .

But these were the health service politicians and happily they were not typical .

Instead of privatizing the health service ,  I wanted to modernize it so that it could better tackle the problems of the 1980s and 1990s .

The records of local Labour parties reveal that Labour 's  feverish organizational activities were not confined to the national party alone .  This was abundantly clear in the textile district of the West Riding .  Here , the detritus of pre - war Labour politics was quickly absorbed into the more unified Labour Party <head>organization</head> which emerged after 1918 . Constituency parties were formed for all the major industrial constituencies .  The rather amorphous Huddersfield Labour movement was transformed into the more clearly defined Huddersfield Divisional Labour Party in the spring and summer of 1918 .

It believes that the Country needs a return of the sane principles of peace ,  retrenchment ,  and reform ,  which formed the basis of Liberal policy a generation ago. Indeed , few annual reports of Liberal <head>organizations</head> missed the opportunity to reiterate the need for free trade , peace , sound finance and a modicum of reform . From 1917 onwards ,  many referred to the need for proportional representation and some charged the Labour Party with fomenting class warfare through its parliamentary and municipal campaigns .  By 1926 and 1927 local Liberal parties were beginning to note that the Labour Party was responsible for dark passages in the history of Liberalism .

The Spanish Medical Aid Committee reviewing the situation at the end of the first year had sent out forty - seven ambulances ,  eighty trained personnel ,  had constructed two base hospitals and several field hospitals and had set up a convalescent home  the Ralph Fox Memorial Home in memory of a well - known author and critic who had died in action in Spain during 1936 .  About ten months later ,  in a report to an  International Congress at Paris it was stated that the Spanish Medical Aid Committee had helped to set up nineteen hospitals throughout Republican Spain ,  some front - line hospitals and seventy - two ambulances .  There were in fact many <head>organizations</head> supplying help to the Republican government . They raised money in a variety of ways ,  from auctioning sketches of Picasso 's  Guernica  to showing ,  up and down the country ,  the films The Defence of Madrid and Spanish Earth  .  British miners raised 80,000 for Spain ,  the Labour party Spain Committee collected 49,000 .

The effectiveness of the Labour Spain Committee was impaired both by the fact that it was  was  associated with the movement in the constituency Labour parties and also because it was effectively advocating a  a  popular front against fascism ,  which the Labour Party continued to reject throughout the 1930s ;  after the political disasters of 1931 it wanted no treating with its political enemies whether of the left or the right .  The Labour Party leadership also felt that the British people were not ,  as yet ,  ready for war :  In Great Britain the position was that no Government would be able to secure public support for any action which the people believed would lead to war .   Nevertheless , whilst a joint campaign with the Communist Party and other political <head>organizations</head> was entirely out of the question , the Labour leadership felt compelled to adjust its policy with regard to Spain . Shortly after the Edinburgh Conference ,  the National Council of Labour ,  which brought the executives of the TUC and the Labour Party together ,  agreed that the Spanish government should have its commercial rights restored .  By June 1937 the National Council of Labour ,  effectively speaking for the Labour Party ,  decided to reverse its Edinburgh policy and to oppose non - intervention .

They were Commies .  They were Red sons of bitches who should have died long ago. The columnist Westbrook Pegler must have approved that passage , for he wrote : The only sensible way to deal with them is to make membership in Communist <head>organizations</head> a capital offence and shoot or otherwise put to death all persons convicted of such . For a long time it seemed impossible to refer to Communists without using the words conspiracy and sons of bitches .  But the Cold War was fundamentally one of history 's  wars of religion ,  and there were those who realized that the struggle to preserve American Ideals from the ideas of Marx and Lenin had to be conducted on a religious or moral plane .

The new town development was not sited on Londonderry but between the largely Protestant towns of Lurgan and Portadown .  Certainly one would have to agree that O'Neill did little to change either the reality or Catholic perceptions of their subordinate position in the polity and the economy but his failure almost certainly owed more to his lack of power than to his lack of desire .  Farrell uses the fact that O'Neill joined the Apprentice Boys of Derry and the Royal Black Preceptory ( two Protestant fraternal <head>organizations</head> similar to the Orange Order ) to portray him as a closet die - hard unionist but in so doing misses the glaring point that O'Neill had to join these organizations because he was not already a member . Any genuinely orthodox unionist would have been a member since late adolescence !  O'Neill 's  suspect views were known to many unionists and the conservatives did not have to wait for the fruits of O'Neillism ,  however timid they may have been .

O'Neill 's  minor reforms or ,  as Utley perceptively describes it ,  his government by gesture i served only to politicize further the frustration of the Catholic population ,  without making it any more committed to the Northern Ireland state .  O'Neill also failed to appreciate the extent of Protestant misgivings ,  preferring instead to see Paisley and his supporters as a small and unrepresentative rabble .  Dismissing Paisley 's support as a fascist <head>organization</head> masquerading under the cloak of religion deluding a lot of sincere people hell - bent on provoking religious strife in Northern Ireland , he seemed unprepared for the reaction against him within his own party . While attempting to respond to the civil rights movement and to the pressure from the Wilson government in London ,  O'Neill was being threatened from within the Unionist camp .  Although the first revolt was crushed ,  Desmond Boal could still raise thirteen Unionist backbenchers '  signatures for the removal of O'Neill ,  and Lord Brookeborough ,  only three years after handing the premiership to O'Neill ,  was leading a whispering campaign against him.

In March of the following year ,  when the feuding between the UDA and the UVF reached the point of tit - for - tat assassination ,  Paisley called on Protestants to withdraw all support from the paramilitaries and accused them of committing crimes just as heinous and hellish as those of the IRA .  Fred Procter ,  by then a DUP Belfast city councillor ,  was shot ,  apparently by the UVF ,  who objected to his spirited criticisms of  gangsterism on the Shankill Road .  The fighting between the UVF and UDA , and the struggles for power within the UDA , did much to damage the reputation of the working - class loyalist <head>organizations</head> and to permit the professional politicians to regain control after the UWC strike . What also helped to undermine their credibility were the claims that the UDA and UVF were socialist or communist .  Few accusations ,  if they can be made to stick ,  are more damaging in the context of Northern Irish politics where leftism has traditionally been associated with nationalism .

Whatever initial reasons people had for being attracted to Ian Paisley as a politician ,  the main reason for their support was their commitment to the principles he enunciated .  In the end they were committed ,  as he was ,  to the preservation of a Protestant Ulster ,  to the suppression of what they saw as a republican rebellion ,  and to the restoration of majority rule in Northern Ireland .  The leaders and the activists were no doubt also motivated by personal ambition and by a jealous regard for their own <head>organizations</head> but , at various crisis points , many were willing to subordinate their own ambitions to the greater goal of saving Ulster . The 1977 Strike and the Collapse of the Coalition Most of the leaders of the 1974 strike felt that they had achieved their goal when Faulkner 's  power - sharing executive was forced to resign .

Vanguard had little <head>organization</head> in East Belfast and the Official Unionists gave very little assistance . Craig 's  campaign manager therefore was the young leader of the DUP in East Belfast ,  Peter Robinson .  With the collapse of the coalition ,  Robinson felt free to challenge the man for whom he had previously campaigned and he won the seat by the extremely narrow margin of sixty - four votes .

It should be clear from the preceding chapters that the Free Presbyterian Church is no ordinary evangelical sect  ( using that term in its sociological rather than pejorative sense )  .  The political crisis which vastly increased its recruitment could not help but give it an unusual character .  Other religious organizations , such as the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa , have played important parts in providing religious legitimation for political ideologies , but few modern churches have had so many of their personnel actively involved in one particular political <head>organization</head> . This close association of religion and politics has also given the organizational vehicle for the politics  the DUP  an unusual character which I now wish to explore by examining the tensions caused by the presence in a political agenda of religious attitudes .  In theology ,  Free Presbyterians are Calvinists .
