While numbers of new AIDS cases reported officially each month have remained relatively steady ,  there has been a big increase in those needing expert medical and nursing advice at home with a 24 - hour on call back up. The numbers with pain are also higher .  Those at home often need opiates ( morphine - like medicines ) for pain , while one in five will also need a special battery - <head>operated</head> syringe pump , especially if they are too weak to swallow . Specialist care The picture then has changed and we now need to plan for increasing numbers of those with chronic illnesses needing specialist community care  not just volunteers ,  although volunteers continue to have a vitally important role to play .

( See Amnesty  Oct/Nov 1990 )  .  The four members of the National Police were arrested in June 1990 .  At their trial , the judge is believed to have added 25 per cent to each sentence specifically because the police had carried out the attack while <head>operating</head> in their official capacity . In April AI learned that warrants had been issued for the arrest of two police officers and a civilian in connection with the killing of 17 - year - old Anstraum Aman Villagrn Morales .  Anstraum Villagrn was shot and killed on 25 June 1990 in Guatemala City by two uniformed police officers .

Perhaps he will be back  next time .  The novel 's  third scene or zone is the city itself .  The automobile has turned the city inside out , ranging new communities around the periphery and letting the centre rot : not far from the centre is an old slum district where the gangs <head>operate</head> . They are a reality ,  whereas the guerrillas are only a dream  phantasmagorical .  But they are a reality which Naipaul treats in such a way that they ,  too ,  can at times seem phantasmagorical .

Above all you need new audience experience now you are out of drama school .  And ,  although nobody wishes to be exploited with low wages and very difficult conditions ,  it is frankly better to find the ways and means of presenting yourself somehow ,  than not perform at all .  The new actor is generally <head>operating</head> in top gear and if this momentum is stopped it can be very damaging to the morale and can result in an actor 's technical skills going rusty something to be avoided at all costs . To speak of further training programmes now may sound like a mere desperate remedy ,  but it does n't mean anything as arduous or as expensive as the full training of your drama school .  Actors who are serious about their work always look on the voice and movement class as an important part of their life .

As the table on page 88 shows ,  there is a huge choice of pasta as an ingredient .  For many years caterers could obtain only dried pasta .  But since the early 1980s , chilled fresh pasta has also been on the market , from large and small suppliers <head>operating</head> on both national and regional bases . In the past five or six years ,  foodservice companies have also been able to supply frozen pasta .  John Bray ,  senior brand manager for Nestl Foodservice ,  which supplies both dried and frozen pasta ,  is keen to dispel any thought that one type of pasta is better or worse than another .

The job paid quite well and I could perhaps at that stage have afforded somewhere slightly better to live ,  but I 'd got used to my new home and I was still keen to try and build up some savings again .  The building I was now working in housed a number of statutory and voluntary social - services organizations .  My job was to <head>operate</head> the telephone switchboard , sort the morning post , direct house - callers to the appropriate organization , and that was about it . The telephones kept me just about busy but the potential for job satisfaction in the tasks I was required to do was almost nil .  This was ,  I kept telling myself ,  just a staging post .

First open the brakes or spoilers fully ,  checking them visually whenever this is possible .  Then close them with a firm push on the lever in order to establish the habit .  The pilot should be able to feel the geometric lock <head>operating</head> just after the airbrakes are flush with the wing surface . In some cases there is a gate for the lever to go into once the brakes are correctly locked .  This operation needs to be explained and demonstrated to every student .

Merely pushing the lever forwards as far as it will go is not enough because the lock may be very stiff .  Modern gliders usually have spring - loaded caps which are pulled down firmly to prevent air leaking into or out of the wing .  This makes the lock much stiffer to <head>operate</head> than on the earlier types of glider . A geometric lock which requires no force to lock is seriously out of adjustment .  It may allow the airbrakes to open during a launch if the lever is knocked or if one side is unlocking a little before the other.

Competence The first essentials for any cloud flying in large cumulus are that the glider must be properly equipped for serious flying ,  and the pilot must be competent and experienced enough at instrument flying to be able to regain control from any attitude without having to use the airbrakes .  Because of the risk of a failure of the battery - <head>operated</head> Artificial Horizons , I always insist that pilots are competent to fly on the Turn and Slip Indicator before even trying a Horizon . Many pilots find that they manage safely on their first few short cloud climbs but that they soon get tired and lose their concentration .  It is after they have lost control for the second or third time that the real difficulties appear .

Anthropological modes of enquiry are therefore programmed to steer us through the assumptions of police society ,  so that contradictions no longer remain incomprehensible .  The cultural baggage which any social group ,  tribe ,  or institution such as the police acquires over time can thus be translated to reveal just what sustains it ,  and furthermore reveal what the society itself may not even have understood .  Where there does exist a genuine public expression of concern about the way the police <head>operate</head> this cannot just be dismissed as a matter of misunderstanding or be written off as the foolish ramblings of that police folk devil the loony left , who would dismantle the system for their own political ends . Such a mood of concern has existed now for more than a decade and seems to mirror uncertainties of role occurring elsewhere in society .  For example ,  it can be argued the expansion into amalgamated police units has enlarged the organization to a point where it is no longer accessible to the man in the street ;  alternatively ,  it may be that the use of a centralized computer and complex technical aids has alienated the public even at the same time they are increasingly fed a diet of violent news snippets which reinforce a fear of crime and generate another folk devil of criminal menace ,  which demands the impossible :  a policeman on every corner .

Our modes of dress and consequent loss of deference to the rigidities of rank and other previously respected apparatus of the hierarchical system were all influenced .  Deference to concepts of order based on such signifiers as exact time keeping ,  definitive shift systems ,  spatial purity ,  clearly demarcated terms of address ,  and other measures designed to maintain the systems of control were irrevocably loosened .  In addition , we became experts in a new and complex world where everything from the intricacies of a changing semantic of underground language to the knowledge that tetrahydrocannabinol ( THE ) was the active ingredient of cannabis separated us from our previous associations and took us into a world where few in the organization could begin to <head>operate</head> with comfort . Inevitably ,  over such a long period ,  I became less institutionalized ,  more able to function as an individual in relation to belief and action and not merely accept the organization 's  definition of things ;  and this is a profoundly un - police like state of affairs !  There was no predetermined police model to follow in dealing with our counter - cultural clients ,  no previous police experience to allow us easily to slot hippie behaviour into any comfortable niche .

I tell a small group about a noted professor who was spotted at a tutorial wearing one red and one green sock .  He was described by one of his students as being a brilliant man but so practically inept that he needed help to cross the road safely .  A detective listening to this story nodded gravely , for it confirmed his beliefs , and as he said , these academics cannot <head>operate</head> in the cut and thrust of the real world , can they ? When policemen label one of their colleagues with the term academic it is always a derogatory term of reference ,  while college  man is another derisory phrase used to define that tiny percentage who gain accelerated promotion through one of the special course or graduate entry schemes generated through the police staff college .  Whitaker  ( 1979 :  229 )  records how these college men are described sardonically at police station level ,  as plastic men  who know all about how to hold a knife and fork ,  but nothing about how to catch villains .

If I had no grasp on the shape of the maze ,  that is ,  at least its basic spatial properties ,  I could  not understand any ascription of behaviour to the rat .  This leads to problems when I try to conceive of my own knowing ,  believing or thinking in behaviourist terms .  I cannot think of my own knowledge of the physical world in terms of my dispositions to behave , but only as my dispositions , construed as <head>operating</head> in the world of which I conceive without reference to my dispositions .

The external obliques are situated either side of the rectus abdominis ,  and run diagonally from top to bottom .  It is the obliques and abdominals which create the well trained look .  Thus because there are stomach muscles which <head>operate</head> vertically , diagonally and horizontally , complex bending and twisting movements are possible , and support for the vital abdominal organs is provided . One of the most popular myths in weight training is that higher reps produce bigger abdominals .  However ,  in order for the abdominals to grow you must treat them like any other muscle group ,  and work them hard for 8 to 12 reps using 3 to 4 sets .
