It stands as a sympathetic appraisal by a critic who is trusting largely to his own intuitive sense of quality :  He wants to suggest the exclusive nature of that subliminal world  to dwell there ,  and to forget the conscious world .  He wants to escape to the world of memory - residues , of disconnected <head>images</head> , for that is the world of fantasy , the world of fairy - tales and myths ( Klee 's  art )  denies the reality or sufficiency of normal perception The eye of the artist is concentrated on his pencil ;  the pencil moves and the line dreams .

A demonstration of the point is to compare Civilisation  by Kenneth Clark in its forms as television and book .  The television series is a much richer visual experience ,  and filming has a completely decisive advantage in being able to explore architecture ,  inside and out .  Nevertheless , the limitations of writing a script to accompany <head>images</head> on the screen become clear on the printed page . The pace of television favours simplifications ,  generalised statements ,  witticisms ,  and short sharp judgements on artists '  performances .  A presenter ,  after all ,  knows that a viewer has the visual evidence to check on what is being said .

This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's  writing ,  since it tempts the rash into speculation ,  while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons .  A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .  Again , much interest attaches to interpretation , as an impassive hierarchical <head>image</head> of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure . The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have difficulty in deciding how far the picture needs  to be considered as devotional imagery ,  and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits .

Some are connected with writings about literature ,  philosophy and politics which are called post - modern or post - structural .  Post - structuralist texts expose the role of language in deferring meaning and in constructing a subjectivity which is not fixed but is constantly negotiated through a whole range of forces  economic ,  social and political .  They have undermined long - cherished views of the writer or artist as a unique individual creating in the <head>image</head> of divine creation ( in an unbroken chain that links father and son as in Michelangelo 's God reaching towards Adam in the Sistine Chapel frescoes ) , and the work of art as reducible to a single true meaning Now artistic intention can be seen more clearly as just one of many often overlapping strands  ideological ,  economic ,  social ,  political  that make up the work of art ,  whether literary text ,  painting ,  or sculpture .  The most difficult theoretical surveys are those which seem to promise to answer difficult questions about art in general ,  perhaps especially in the modern world .

Secondly ,  the formal analysis which is second nature to a Western critic can be fruitful ,  even though it could be argued that this is a way of interpreting the objects of an unfamiliar culture rather than a description .  A further type of difficulty arises in descriptions of works produced in far Eastern cultures .  While a Western eye is familiar with the process of looking , as it were , through an <head>image</head> to what it represents or means , an Eastern critic looks also at the surface of a painting or a drawing , in which a poem or other calligraphic element may form an integral part of the work . Chinese painting and calligraphy are visual arts on much of an equal footing .  A Japanese example is the surimono  ,  a friendly greeting for the New Year through a drawing and a message which complement each other.

Perhaps this is the more important in the late twentieth century now that this means of image - making is so familiar that some people actually imagine that a photograph shows the world as it is .  In truth ,  the camera is a ruthless editor of visual information ;  this can be made plain by looking at a picture ,  say of the eighteenth century ,  and comparing it with a contemporary print ,  perhaps an aquatint ,  and a modern photograph .  The <head>images</head> carry different information . The physical make - up of dots in a photograph differs from the lines and granular surface of the aquatint ;  the aquatint 's  variations describe the picture more eloquently .  The art of civilisations other than that of the West are now more readily visible through photography ,  and within the limitations of the medium ,  usefully so .

Nowadays ,  nearly every young person has probably had some experience of basic improvisation at their school or through the extensive TIE  ( Theatre in Education )  tours .  In drama schools ,  improvisation is about finding a way of expanding the imagination and liberating the senses ,  which can get too confined if students work entirely from a text all the time .  The use of impro in training has gone through many phases ; it still conjures up the traditional , hackneyed <head>image</head> of a student being asked to be a tree or an icecream . But it 's  possible to go way beyond these limited ,  obvious exercises ,  and impro can be immensely exciting for young actors ,  allowing them to grasp situations and emotions imaginatively ,  perhaps for the first time .  Here is an example of an impro exercise for two actors :  An actor is asked to assume the character of a close family friend who arrives at the house with the news of the death of the wife 's  husband in an accident .

The broader tradition is a typically nationalist one ,  seeing national liberation through war as honourable and singularly justified .  To a degree it is widespread among many not just in the provisional movement but also in the Fianna Fil party ,  and in general among those who see their history as one of liberation through blood .  The statue in the market square at Dundalk , a Provisional Sinn Fein memorial , of the Irish liberator rising up behind the phoenix , is an <head>image</head> with much wider appeal . The Easter rising of 1916 as an act of national liberation ,  unquestioned in the dominant catholic  nationalist culture from 1922 until well into the 1960s and 1970s ,  still holds a cherished place in the hearts of the majority of the people .  It is possible for such sentiments of approval of this past to coexist with abhorrence for most current acts of violence .

This ,  so far as it concerns Leonard ,  simply goes too far .  He was not trying to organise anything !  He was speaking from a mind full of ideas and <head>images</head> , which all offered insight in varying ways , which he sought to reflect on over several years . It is placing an artificial ,  not to say architectonic ,  view on the whole work so to argue ;  it is to take his mythology too seriously ,  too literally ;  to fail to see that the excess was part of the message .  It is unfortunate that the influential Dudek could only illustrate Leonard 's  work by quoting from the admittedly despondent poem Rededication ,  without a reference to the many other elements of positive delight that the book  and Leonard 's  work elsewhere at that time  demonstrates .

Hume described Berkeley 's  attack on abstract ideas as the most important development of late in the republic of letters .

It is tempting to think of it as a felt  tendency ,  so that one is somehow aware of where the mind is going .  This will not do ,  for it is no different from saying that when one experiences red one thinks or conceives of the colour ,  whereas the point of the theory was to explain what such thinking ,  or conceiving ,  is .  It is similarly tempting to think of the colour <head>image</head> as hovering in the background , somehow anticipated by the mind ; but this is a metaphor , for the image either is or is not in consciousness . And ,  contrary to Hume 's  contention ,  being very dimly  in consciousness is not the same as being thought of .  The tendency of the mind to move from one thing to another has to consist in the straightforward fact that one thing usually follows ,  or is caused by ,  the other ;  the tendency or association cannot be thought of as some experienced  feature of the situation without reviving the original situation of having an unanalysed conception of the mind 's  ability to reach out and apprehend things .

From the point of view of the experiencing subject ,  the meaningfulness is not something of which he is conscious ;  all he experiences is ,  first the word red ,  then a mental image :  there is nothing that could count as his internally and introspectably associating them which does not reintroduce the mysterious generality of thought .  It does not help the associationist to press the concept of resemblance to his aid .  It might seem that it would , because it might seem very natural to think that one red thing or <head>image</head> might be taken as standing for red things in general because of its natural resemblance to the other members of the class , this constituting the most fundamental sort of association . But resemblance cannot explain how a thinker could experience one object as standing for another ;  for how could the fact that a particular  datum is similar to other things mean anything to a thinker unless he experienced it as  being like many others  that is ,  unless he grasped it ,  not just as a particular but as  an instance of a kind ?  But this is the very ability for which we are trying to account .

Use of line Designs composed of small masses of veneer forming a readable picture ,  correspond roughly in looks ,  if not in colour ,  to subjects as they actually appear to the eye ;  they seem to be in 3D even though they are flat ,  and to a degree they are naturalistic .  There is another branch of graphics , however , in which an <head>image</head> is produced by the use of line rather than mass . In its most basic form the technique involves merely an outline ,  or when it is filled in ,  a silhouette ;  but of course it can be much more elaborate than that .  Linear representation of solid form has always been a valid artistic technique ,  especially in drawing  ( as distinct from painting )  ,  and it can be used in marquetry work also provided the nature of the material  ( ie .  wood )  is not ignored .

Each memory block is called a bit plane ,  and supplies one of the bits needed for each pixel .  This is illustrated in Fig. 6 ,  showing typical mapping from the start of the four bit plane base addresses and the first line of pixels on the screen .  The main body of a bit <head>image</head> file consists of data bytes with bit mapping similar to figs 3 to 5 . Bit image files normally have a fixed format header giving general information about the file and its format .  One way to handle different bit mapping schemes is to include in the header details such as the number of bit planes ,  bits per pixel ,  pixels per scan line ,  and the number of scan lines .

This untypically flashy Icelander ,  who has lived most of his life in Las Vegas ,  and worked on Mr Bush 's  election campaign ,  has recently been in charge of polishing the images of Frank Sinatra and Donald Trump ,  the New York city real estate person .

The Rogich plan is to sharpen up the focus ,  as well as the pace .  Does Mr Bush foresee some sort of crisis during which his <head>image</head> will suffer unless boosted ? Economic troubles ,  perhaps ?  Or is he really planning to speed up his reaction to Gorbachev and Eastern Europe ?

You could say the secret is location ,  location ,  location .  That one small doubt became a huge question mark two days later when ,  before the opening home game with Arsenal ,  Knighton took the field in a United playing strip  ( having refused the previous day to be photographed holding a United shirt )  and juggled ,  headed and kicked a football in front of a at first incredulous and then delighted Stretford End .  There is nothing illegal nor immoral in a club chairman 's demonstration of ball skills but the contrast , in a day , between the <head>image</head> of a shy , reclusive , multi - millionaire property tycoon and that of a terrace tearaway was too sudden to digest . Within days rumours began to circulate that Knighton would have difficulty in raising the 10m he needed to buy out Edwards ,  the 10m reserved to buy out other shareholders and the 10m pledged to the rebuilding of the Stretford End .  It also emerged that United 's  new No. 1 fan had tried to buy Bolton Wanderers in 1988 .

The latest argument deployed in Whitehall yesterday was not only that sanctions hurt the worst - off sections of the South African community  the ones they are designed to help  but that financial measures against South Africa might induce the country to default on its international commitments .  Mrs Thatcher has emphasised that to avoid the troubles which have afflicted other African countries ,  a majority - ruled South Africa must be based on a sound economy .  The British line has been that there is a huge difference between the <head>image</head> of Britain accepted in South Africa and the reality . Officials said that President de Klerk was severely shaken by his meetings with Mrs Thatcher and Sir Geoffrey Howe ,  then Foreign Secretary .  There seems to be an idea in South Africa that Britain will protect the country in the Security Council and fight against the imposition of sanctions .

The Berkeley Square Gallery ,  for example ,  maintains a second outlet in Tokyo ,  as a vital part of its operations .  Japanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints ,  because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage .  They do not make the distinction between an <head>image</head> on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious indeed axiomatic to Europeans . They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists  Hokusai ,  for instance ,  and Hiroshige  made print - making a primary creating medium .  Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image  to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing .

This is fairly easy to answer ,  but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again .  A recent major commercial show of Miro 's  work ,  for example ,  took all his prices to a new high .  A big coloured <head>image</head> , such as the aptly named Le Samourai , will now cost 25,000 .

So do major prints by Sam Francis  ( who lived and worked for a while in Japan )  .  The benchmark here is over 50,000 .  Matisse and Picasso , who form the backbone of the market in classic modern prints , bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the <head>image</head> and its attractiveness . A beautiful odalisque by Matisse ,  such as Torso with a Jug ,  typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s ,  will bring 35,000 or more .  Images from Picasso 's  eternally popular Vollard Suite ,  which dates from the early 1930s ,  bring between 8,000 and 12,000 plus  but these ,  though easy to like because of their smooth neo - classical style ,  are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition .
