Each feels sorry for himself .  Each is lyrical .  But the lyricism of the character Klima can be considered an element in the lyricism of Ivan Klima , and be thought to <head>encounter</head> there its own critique . As for that business of going to the police ,  I am sorry I mentioned it .  There is nothing in the stories to suggest that either of these lyrical Klimas has the makings of the hero of the state imagined by Kundera .

The signals from the two switches are fed to two operational amplifiers configured as simple RC low - pass filter/integrators .

The only issues to be explored systematically are those of negotiating access  ( for example ,  Fox and Lundman 1974 ;  Holdaway 1982 )  ,  and the effects of gender on practice in the field  ( for example ,  Easterday et al  .  1977 ;  Hunt 1984 ;  Warren 1988 ;  Warren and Rasmussen 1977 )  .  However , until very recently , the leading ethnographers of the police made few disclosures on the difficulties they <head>encountered</head> , implying that their entry into the field and relations with police officers were unproblematic . Although often studying less controversial forces than the RUC ,  this panglossian portrayal has to be disbelieved ,  especially as the authors often indicated in an occasional footnote ,  or in a revealing preface or aside ,  that they faced problems in the field similar to our own  ( for example ,  see van Maamen 1981 :  479 ,  492 ;  Westley 1970 ,  p. vii )  ,  even when the research was covert  ( Holdaway 1982 ,  1983 :  12 )  .  The only exception to this is the discussion of the likely reactive effect caused by the presence of observers  ( McCall 1975 ;  Policy Studies Institute 1983b :  1115 ;  Reiss 1971 ;  Softley 1980 ;  Southgate and Ekblom 1986 ;  Steer 1980 )  ,  although no serious doubt is put on the validity of observational data on the police .

On one level ,  it did not prevent some respondents expressing disparaging remarks about Catholics ,  nor dissuade them from giving opinions on controversial political issues .  On a deeper level ,  however ,  as we shall see in later chapters ,  the identity category Catholic is ,  for the majority of policemen and women ,  not an all - inclusive typification in which every Catholic is categorized alike .  Most members of the RUC we <head>encountered</head> used an interpretative process which contains a set of typifications for distinguishing between good and bad Catholics , as for good and bad people generally . Once the field - worker was categorized as conforming to their typification of a good Catholic  ( the meaning of which we will outline elsewhere )  ,  then her religion was no longer as important as it appears at first sight ,  although the extent to which it had a residual effect is impossible to estimate .  But it only remained of crucial importance to that small minority of bigoted constables who classify all Catholics as equally evil and nefarious .

Police work involves so much bloody paperwork these days and a lot of boring stuff that a family row can quite spice up a night .  ( FN 4/12/86 ,  pp. 23 )  In contrast , the effect of dealing with domestic disputes can be traumatic on some policemen as they momentarily place their own children and family in the situation of emotional horror they <head>encounter</head> . However ,  it is generally the case that violence against women provokes no strong emotion in policemen .  Faragher  ( 1985 )  found that police in Great Britain downgraded the seriousness of violence  against women in the home ,  for although formal regulations state that it is to be treated as an arrestable offence ,  policemen often redefined the incident as lying outside law enforcement  ( emphasized by Policy Studies Institute 1983b :  64 )  .

It would have been more accurate to say that all policemen and women should have such a role ,  for unfortunately many do not  ( see Trojanowicz and Pollard 1986 )  .  It was an attitude like this which made the individual transfer to community relations in the first place ,  as all those in Easton 's  Community Relations Unit did ,  one even from the Traffic Branch .  This self - selection process ensures that the Community Relations Branch attracts people with enthusiasm and the necessary personal qualities which make them enjoy work with youngsters , and not one member of the Community Relations Branch we <head>encountered</head> in Easton and elsewhere expressed anything other than pleasure and enjoyment from working with youngsters . Such enthusiasm makes them appear eccentric compared to policemen and women on the sections .  The marginality they experience within the force might lead them to exaggerate their job satisfaction ,  but this cuts both ways ,  for the unpopularity of community relations among many ordinary members of the RUC guarantees it will not appeal to any but the committed ,  and section duties already afford the work - shy many opportunities to hide .

Human existence ,  for Marx and Engels ,  occurs in terms of people 's  concepts ,  which are incorporated in their mode of life and their subjective experience ,  but it is from man 's  interaction with nature and from the history of this interaction that these ideas ,  beliefs ,  and values are created in the first place .  The argument runs like this :  at any particular time people apprehend natural material circumstances through their ideas ,  and they  therefore act in terms of these ideas ,  beliefs ,  and values .  Therefore , in history it is not nature and technology which makes human society but it is man himself , who in terms of his already existing ideas and values , makes his own history , as he <head>encounters</head> nature and the problems it poses . These already existing ideas and values are ,  however ,  themselves the product of previous encounters and answers to the challenge of nature .  This means that the relation of ideas and practical problems can only be understood as part of the process of history .

So it is not implausible for critics to say that the solid - state detectors are unreliable and somehow bring about a sharp distortion in the spectra .

A genuine but mundane antiquity can have its value increased enormously by the addition of a unique feature ,  or of a historical association such as a royal cipher .  Given the complexity of many of the objects ,  and the almost endless possibilities of treatment that could have befallen them ,  the scientist needs the collaboration of the art historian ,  in addition to a very wide experience of antiquities and knowledge of the technical processes of the past ,  in order to reconstruct as much as possible of a particular object 's  background history .  Some of the scientific methods and problems <head>encountered</head> are exemplified below by specific case histories . The main approaches to the scientific detection of fakes are :  the study of composition and methods of construction to see if they match the supposed age of the object ;  examination for evidence of aging ,  such as the formation of a patina ;  and the application  of archaeological dating techniques ,  which can at least give an indication of age and in some cases an actual date .

Plant fossils are often to be found in particular beds ,  reflecting conditions of deposition that were just right for their preservation .

Clearly a great deal of what religious traditions have to say about the Deity presupposes a personal God .  We think of a being who shows various emotions towards creation  love ,  wrath ,  anger ,  sorrow ,  mercy and so on  and who is associated with particular activities that we think of as actions taken by persons ,  such as judgement .

On 17 December Reynolds and his wife Anne ,  with Blake safely hidden away ,  left Britain on the Dover ferry to Ostend ,  drove across Belgium to West Germany and thence to a border crossing - point with East Germany where they arrived on 19 December .  Here Blake left them ,  identified himself to the surprised border guards and a few days later was flown to  Mosow  for a triumphant reunion with the KGB .  Travelling on a false passport made out in the name of James Richardson , Bourke travelled by train from London to Paris ( apparently without <head>encountering</head> any problems with the police who were searching for him ) , and thence by air to Berlin where he crossed into the eastern sector and shortly afterwards was flown to Moscow to be reunited with Blake . Bourke did not enjoy his time in Russia and on 23 October 1968 returned to his native Ireland .  The British government attempted to extradite Bourke for his part in helping Blake escape but after a long legal wrangle this was rejected by the Irish courts .

Hinkley Point A ,  for example ,  even with the benefit of the mechanized army so lyrically portrayed by The Times  correspondent ,  took seven and a half years to build instead of its projected five ,  and went about 25 per cent over budget  ( 34 million )  .

As each new AGR started construction , such serious engineering and design problems were <head>encountered</head> that the designers had to make major alterations to the next in the series . These proved extremely expensive .  But it has taken outside analysts to underline just how much public money was involved .

However ,  a number are household names ;  the obvious examples are the Severn and the Thames .  Like most other rivers ,  the Thames was harnessed to drive many mills .

Many of these local mills remain in name alone ,  having fallen into disuse and demolition .  The most important to have survived is Lower Mill  at Somerford Keynes .

And so the image is important :  it keeps the punters on the hook .

For Nicholson ,  success in this quarter is doubly gratifying  displaying his ability to attract women by means other than looks .  Unlike Beatty ,  who always had the advantage of being the living image of the role - model Hollywood leading man with dark ,  mysterious eyes ,  classic features and a huge mop of hair ,  Nicholson is the unlikely romantic hero .

But it was soon followed by another American study of the elderly ,  Margaret Clark and Barbara Anderson 's  Culture and Ageing   ( 1967 )  ,  attacking the idea that disengagement was typical or commendable .

We <head>encounter</head> the contrasts between at one extreme domesticated grandfathers , and at the other , elderly couples at war . We can see how family memory is socially shaped ,  and also the willingness to incorporate substitutes ,  not always related in any way ,  for absent grandparents .

On its simplest level the Zone denotes Germany immediately before and after military defeat ,  but it is much more than that .  The Zone is an area of ontological flux where the plots of the novel blur and where texts begin to proliferate .  We <head>encounter</head> a string of bawdy limericks , a dream - poem ( with woodcuts ) , a film - script , and the recording of a Kazakh singing duel , among others . In some of these cases Pynchon deals with the political dimensions of cultural representation :  print as a means of subjugating an oral culture ;  direction as a means of implicating actors in roles subservient to the director 's  fantasy  ( almost like a miniature history of German Fascism )  and so on .  The key term here is control whose biological and political connotations are applied to the ordering of Pynchon 's  text .

I especially liked the two stage ,  visual and audio ,  too fast ascent warnings .

A comforting aspect of wildlife watching in Scotland is that nothing is out to eat you .

Many of the indicators chosen are suspect ,  as Macnicol has shown for earlier periods ,  in that they simply count contact with state agencies ,  and it is a commonplace observation that the poor are more likely to be in contact with social workers because they are poor  ( Becker ,  1988 )  ;  young drug - takers in inner cities are more visible than wealthy socialites but drug - taking and drinking stretch across social groups  ( O'Bryan ,  1989 ;  Plant ,  1989 )  ;  desertion of women by husbands and the choice to remain unmarried are not restricted to the poor ;  and so on and so on .  All these signs of inadequacy are nothing of the kind but are indicators of poverty and powerlessness .  Only measures of material social conditions , unemployment , income , housing conditions , density of population , can usefully serve to characterize the deprivation <head>encountered</head> by those forced to live in these circumstances . The underclass is what the working poor become when they are not employed .  Once jobs arise and if they are paid for their labour ,  they become the workers again ;  sometimes they are just as poor but their class position has changed .

for these children the field is wide open to start all over again ,  and to introduce them to the idea of religion from scratch .

Children will <head>encounter</head> the Christian Church in the outside world , and will meet with Christianity among their contemporaries as they grow up , even if they have not met it at home . But the crucial point is that the history of Christianity is completely interwoven with the history not just of this country but with that of Europe and America as a whole .  It is central alike to a study of the arts and of such institutions as the monarchy and Parliament .

As a consequence of biological functioning animals have a variety of needs .

We have to know about the various behavioural and physiological changes which occur in difficult situations ,  and we have to understand adverse effects on body condition ,  growth ,  reproduction and so on .  Animals have a range of methods of trying to cope and there are various consequences of failure to cope .
