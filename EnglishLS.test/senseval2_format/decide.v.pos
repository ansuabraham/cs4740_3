By the end of 1961 there were 11 groups ,  nine in the UK ,  one in Norway and one in Australia .  In February 1963 there were already 180 groups worldwide .  The increase was even felt to be too great : in 1964 , when British groups reached 212 , it was <head>decided</head> to slow down the growth in the UK not to act upon the ephemeral enthusiasms of an odd individual , but to go for quality . There was also concern that groups were growing faster in the UK than in the rest of the world .  The number of UK groups reached 300 in the early 1980s and has remained around that level ever since  groups of very high quality and certainly not based on ephemeral enthusiasms !

In writing about Delacroix ,  he placed his hero in a pantheon of artists who were acknowledged masters of great decorative painting :  Which is the greatest of these great men who differ so much from one another ?  Each must <head>decide</head> as he pleases , according to whether his temperament urges him to prefer the prolific , radiant , almost jovial abundance of Rubens ; the mild dignity and eurhythmic order of Raphael ; the paradisal one might almost say the afternoon colour of Veronese ; the austere and strained severity of David ; or the dramatic and almost literary rhetoric of Lebrun . The critic ,  too ,  according to Baudelaire has a right to be independent ,  and to work without a system which is a kind of damnation which forces one to a perpetual recantation .  He wrote :

Again ,  much interest attaches to interpretation ,  as an impassive hierarchical image of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure .  The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have difficulty in <head>deciding</head> how far the picture needs to be considered as devotional imagery , and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits . An extremist view expressed by a twentieth - century artist is what Matisse had to say about his responses to murals by Giotto .  When I see the Giotto frescoes at Padua I do not trouble to recognise which scene in the life of Christ I have before me ,  but I perceive instantly the sentiment which radiates from it and which is instinct in the composition in every line and  color  .

The critic writing in a newspaper with very limited space needs such a label to give the reader a general idea of what is on display .  Using such a shorthand description leaves space for other topics .  Another consequence of the labelling of Impressionism and other groups by critics was that some artists naturally <head>decided</head> that they themselves could do the same job better than the critics . In Western art there  had been artistic programmes and manifestos before Impressionism ,  but in the twentieth century they proliferated .  Part of the critic 's  task in the nineteenth century ,  as now ,  was to interpret art for the lay public ;  but what ,  artists asked themselves ,  if we interpreted our own work ?  from such a thought sprang statements of artistic aims and manifestos ,  some using the new device of naming a group with a progressive title ,  such as futurism .

But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed ,  with clergy being left behind in some areas ,  the clerics remain the true cognoscenti  in religious matters ,  and are expected to be so by the laity .  This has always added to the clergy 's spiritual authority and status , and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals , with the high clergy <head>deciding</head> what constitutes matters of faith and morals . The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life .  The clergy were and still are in a special position ,  holding power over the laity because of it .

However ,  the earthly role of the community ,  be it protestant or catholic ,  is not seen as secondary to the religious message ,  but as either in continuity with or against it .  The Calvinist vision of an earthly city in which pastor and politician work in harmony to exclude evil from the lives of all those within the city walls remains a religious outlook for a significant number of protestant loyalists .  This is a totalizing view of society , and implies a certain anti - pluralism : freedom of belief and action within certain parameters , which are to be <head>decided</head> either by those who appear righteous in the sight of God or by those who , at least , conform in their lawmaking to the advice given to them by the righteous . The very drift of the account of Christian myth and religious political ethics has certain parallels of structure with the siege of Londonderry .  These should be noted ,  before one views the siege as baseline myth for the interpretation of everyday life .

A system failure has a knock - on effect throughout the hotel and adequate contingency plans must be in place to cope with such a situation .

We think it 's  a false economy ,  but we can understand that a seaside hotelier ,  for example ,  may not want to train casual ,  seasonal staff .

The most contentious issue among cutlery suppliers is that of quality .

The decision is not made easier by constant criticism by importers and suppliers of each other.

Perhaps the most important point is that ,  regardless of who may be at the launch point ,  the pilot alone bears the responsibility for accepting or rejecting the launch in the light of the situation as he sees it from the cockpit .  If he has the slightest doubt about his ability to launch safely ,  bearing in mind  such hazards as swinging to one side or a cable break at any stage ,  then he must refuse the launch .  Moreover , if a pilot <head>decides</head> not to launch in a situation like this , he must never be overruled or criticised for playing it safe . Accidents due to swinging on take - off and landing are so common that it is worth studying the causes in detail .  The behaviour of some modern gliders during take - offs and landings is very different to most of the training gliders ,  and it is vital to understand why they are more prone to swinging .

A successful team may have to go through a number of fights during the course of a day 's  competition so it is not at all unusual to see teams short - handed through injury in the final stages .  Never be tempted to forfeit the last two bouts of a male team match , or the last bout of a female team match if you have already seen your team take the <head>deciding</head> first three/two victories . Although the opposing team has no chance of winning ,  any attempt to withdraw your remaining team - member ( s )  may well be rewarded by disqualification of the entire team for bad sportsmanship .

The story of how the traditional management through the regions has been transformed into a marketing one based on the sectors is told elsewhere .  So Far as InterCity is concerned sector management has brought two major benefits :  overall responsibility for deployment of its rolling stock fleet ,  and the building of a national range of express train products .  The first example of equipment redeployment came in 1982 when the then director ( Cyril Bleasdale ) , faced with a serious downturn on Great Western sub - sector services out of Paddington , <head>decided</head> to move ten HSTs to the Midland main line so that a badly needed improvement could be implemented on this potentially profitable and much neglected route . Under the previous organisation it would have taken months of internal wrangling to resolve the conflicting aspirations of regionally based management .  Transfer of all Anglo - Scottish sleeping car services from the East to the West Coast main line from May 1988 was a similar decision based on a corporate rather than a regional viewpoint .

These were Milhaud ,  Poulenc and Auric whose music greatly influenced many later composers such as William Walton and Constant Lambert ,  many of their works remain in constant use today as witness MacMillan 's  moving interpretation of Poulenc 's  Gloria  .  When choreographers <head>decide</head> to commission music , they should first give the composer an outline of the plot , roughly suggesting the sequence of the action , the likely entrances and exits for the characters and the dances or brief scenes in which they are involved . Secondly ,  some description should be given of the characters ,  their moods ,  emotions and particular role in each part of the action .  Thirdly ,  it may be valuable to indicate the style or quality of the movements to be used .

As the critic Ernest Newman wrote :  Music can become dance when it is subjected to repetition ,  multiplication and abstraction using steps ,  poses and gestures with pattern and expression to appeal to both the eye and the intellect  ( see also page 47 )  .  The framework of a ballet Having <head>decided</head> on the story , theme or music , choreographers should consider some vital rules of theatre and construct their ballet in the same way that authors and composers work out their books and compositions . In other words ,  they must take into account another meaning of the word structure  ( see page 70 )  in the sense that it  is the basic framework fur the choreographic design .  As already stated ,  ballets can be roughly divided into the three different kinds usually danced by companies with a classical repertoire .

The pub ,  built around 1600 ,  was bought by a developer in 1988 ,  who wanted to turn it into housing .  The Coln St Aldwyns Society was formed to fight the closure .

The pub was then sold as a going concern and refurbished .  Now new owner Chris Knight is reported to be in financial difficulties .

A narrow track wound steeply up the lower slopes through dense forest ,  and then areas of bamboo and giant heather .  We kept a sharp lookout for animals and saw several waterbuck  timid ,  deer - like creatures  and colobus monkeys ,  with shaggy black and white coats ,  but there was no sign of anything large ,  grey and dangerous .  At about 10,000ft ( 3300m ) we broke out of the trees into an area of grassland that looked vaguely like a Scottish moor and <head>decided</head> to camp for the night . As we were pitching the tents ,  a herd of buffalo wandered by ,  this time plainly visible ,  less than 500 yards away .  They seemed unconcerned  by our presence ,  and the ranger said they were probably deliberately moving out of our way ,  but once again we were reminded that ,  even though this part of Elgon might look like Scotland ,  we were still most definitely in Africa .

Initially ,  that gaping space can be a little puzzling ,  but it 's  quite simple really .  The horizontal distance for the flight of steps can be divided equally to establish the depth of each step ,  correctly called the going .  This should n't be less than 225mm , but before <head>deciding</head> on a firm measurement , the same calculation should be applied to the vertical measurement , between the highest and lowest points . This will give a height  ( riser )  ,  which ideally needs to be around 150mm ,  but not more than 200mm .  From here it 's  a simple juggling act to find the best sizes to suit the application .

The operation had been far from easy ,  the cable being  manhandled out of the hold of a steamer ,  over a pulley and round a drum which measured the speed ,  and then several times round a brake drum before passing into the sea .5 Elsewhere too ,  river estuaries and narrow seas were interconnected by cable .  It was in the course of one such exercise the British engineer Frederick Gisborne <head>decided</head> to span the Atlantic Ocean by submarine cable . While seeking more financial support for the final leg of another project  that of connecting New York and Newfoundland by cable  Gisborne held discussions with American entrepreneur Cyrus Field ,  in the course of which the Atlantic cable was mentioned .  Field in turn ,  immediately sought advice on the feasibility of the concept from a US Naval hydrographer and oceanographer ,  Lieutenant Matthew Maury .

So a driver could listen ,  for example ,  to one of the BBC national networks ,  while the set automatically switches temporarily to a local station making a traffic announcement .  BBC has been testing EON on its local radio traffic experiment in south - east England and the Midlands for about two years ,  and several other European countries are already ,  or soon will be ,  implementing EON ,  although none of the 50 or so existing RDS models is suitable for this function .  BBC claims that it would not have <head>decided</head> to go ahead with EON on a country - wide basis unless it had received assurances that other firms will have suitable second generation RDS receivers on the market soon . DoT 's  rosy future In an IEE lecture :  Broadcasting traffic information ,  Simon Shute  ( BBC )  and Alistair Robertson  ( Dept of Transport )  presented a generally rosy view of the future of RDS .

By the late seventies some British academics were displaying a wary but sympathetic interest in early or classical structuralism ,  particularly as it was expounded in Culler 's  widely read Structuralist Poetics  ,  a lucid ,  urbane work which suggested that structuralism might ,  without too much difficulty ,  be adopted to existing academic practice .  I was partly convinced by Culler 's  power of persuasion ,  and for some time thought that the kinds of analysis he described could be assimilated to practical criticism and the English synthesis .  Eventually I <head>decided</head> that assimilation was not possible , given Culler 's lack of interest in the interpretation of particular texts and his commitment to the uncovering of the generalized principles of literariness . In Structuralist Poetics  Culler took an unenthusiastic view of deconstructionism ,  but he shortly  returned to the United States and succumbed to the deconstructive wave that swept through the American academy in the late seventies ,  and into which I did not feel inclined to plunge .  David Lodge was another established British academic and writer who took an early interest in formalist and structuralist methods and principles .

On many a winter morning I jumped out of bed and put a letter of his in the fire ,  feeling it would be wrong to allow it to survive ;  and when some years ago I was asked by a distinguished man of letters if I could help him to write an account of Maurice Hewlett ,  I rashly said I would send him some of the letters I had received from him. But when I looked over those I had kept , I <head>decided</head> I could not do so . If many of Hewlett 's  correspondents felt as Mrs Lowndes did ,  this explains why Hewlett 's  letters as edited by Laurence Binyon  ( 1925 )  make such unexciting reading ;  she herself records that of the three hundred letters printed by Binyon there was only one which I felt to be characteristic of the man I knew so well .  Binyon 's  volume does however bear out quite touchingly one point that Mrs Lowndes makes :  that Hewlett 's  ambition was to be known as a poet rather than novelist ,  though it was his historical romances in Wardour Street prose that brought him fame and money .

Louis Untermeyer ,  Robert Frost 's  correspondent who was to be an influential anthologist ,  wrote of Poems  ( The Freeman  ,  30 June 1920 )  that Eliot cares more for his art than he does for his attitudes ;  and that the exaltation which is the very breath of poetry  that combination of tenderness and toughness  is scarcely ever present in Eliot 's  lines .  When The Waste Land  appeared ,  Untermeyer had become more irate :  The Dial 's   award to Mr T. S. Eliot and the subsequent bookpublication of his The Waste Land  have occasioned a display of some of the most enthusiastically naive superlatives that have ever issued from publicly sophisticated iconoclasts .  The poem itself he found a pompous parade of erudition , and he <head>decided</head> that were it not for the Laforgue mechanism , Mr Eliot s poetic variations on the theme of a super - refined futility would be increasingly thin and incredibly second rate ( The Freeman , 17 January 1923 ) . Obviously a writer who is happy with super - refined  ( elsewhere he says that Eliot 's  Portrait of a Lady is extraordinarily sensitized )  is not a critic worth pausing on for long ;  and yet when Untermeyer cites all too patent imitations of Eliot 's  Sweeney Among the Nightingales in quatrains by Osbert Sitwell and Herbert Read and Robert Nichols ,  one can see good reason for him to think that Eliot s reputation ,  achieved so fast on such a slender body of work ,  was no more than modish .  And indeed it asks no great exertion of the historical imagination to recognize that ,  at a time when the Sitwells were taken to be modernists equal with Eliot and Pound ,  modish  was just what Eliot 's  reputation was .

Unless a man can put some thematic invention into vers libre  ,  he would perhaps do well to stick to regular metres ,  which have certain chances of being musical from their form ,  and certain other chances of being musical through his failure in fitting the form .  The one who was  doctrinaire was Williams ,  who regarded the iambic measure as a chief curse of the English legacy from which American poetry must free itself if it was ever to stand on its own .  However , Winters was to <head>decide</head> that Williams was wholly incapable of coherent thought , and when Williams tried to explain his own rhythmical procedures he invented the variable foot which is , as has been remarked , the equivalent of a rubber inch . Williams had a good ear ,  and since his death some of his admirers have made more sense of his procedures than he could ever make for himself ,  but the lamentable effect of his example has been to lead poets to trust their ear implicitly ,  thus discrediting the very notion of measure  .  The closeness of Pound 's  and Eliot 's  collaboration when they were young did not become clear Until 1972 .

Othello is larger - than - life and never more so than when determined to die ,  as White demonstrates in a nobly paced resumption of dignity in the difficult final scene .  But ,  with Iago ,  Nunn has opted for a congruence of scales .  He has <head>decided</head> that the reason Iago proffers for his villainy ( especially the absurd idea that both Casio and Othello have slept with his wife ) are genuine , if deranged convictions , rather than the dispassionately improvised rationalisations of a mind that cannot even account to itself for its limitless evil . Accordingly ,  bitter ,  accusing looks flash between McKellen and Zoe Wanamaker 's  excellent ,  bleakly disillusioned Emilia .  When Othello and Desdemona lovingly embrace ,  Iago grabs his wife in a rough ,  lewdly competitive clinch .

But the Dutch airline has had to agree to reduce its 400m investment in NorthWest to about 175m ,  or about a quarter of the equity involved in the takeover being led by Los Angeles businessman Al Checchi .  The 3.65bn buyout will increase the airline 's  debt - equity ratio from less than 50 per cent to 585 per cent and NorthWest operates one of the oldest fleets in the industry ,  but Mr Skinner 's  chief concern was the citizenship of KLM 's  representative on the NorthWest board .  I ca n't figure out why foreign investment is the battlefield he <head>decided</head> to pick , one official said on Friday . Washington 's  stance seems sure to complicate the United Airlines buyout ,  which was to close a few days after the 10 October deadline set by Mr Skinner for information on BA 's  involvement .  Though BA would have only 15 per cent of the voting shares in United ,  the second - largest US airline ,  its investment represents almost 80 per cent of the equity in the deal .
