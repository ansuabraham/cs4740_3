Despite the difficulties of getting into and travelling around many of these countries  due to poor roads ,  curfews ,  civil wars ,  monsoons  researchers often uncover information and testimony they would never otherwise obtain .  In the Philippines last year ,  an investigation team found two disappeared women who had been missing for several months .  The government had not acknowledged their arrest but the team had <head>heard</head> rumours of the women 's whereabouts in a military camp and in fact found them there . When Amnesty International visited Yemen in October 1990 to prepare for government talks ,  they heard reports of thousands of Yemenis being expelled from Saudi Arabia ,  some after being tortured .  The delegates went to the border and spent three days there screening hundreds of people and conducting in - depth interviews with many of them .

One may remove the words next slide please from the text ,  but not from the sequences of thought .  The publication of lectures is a well - known form of literary suicide .  I indulge in it now because the audiences who <head>heard</head> them endured , with much patience , extremes of heat and cold . I am grateful ,  and can only show my gratitude by giving them the text to criticise under more agreeable conditions .  A characteristic two pages of the text are given to Corot 's  landscapes ,  five pictures being cited ,  though the reader is less fortunate than the lecture audience ,  as only two are illustrated .

Salim buries his valuables  from another point of view ,  his ill - gotten gains  and an ominous silence descends on the town :  Sometimes I thought I could hear the noise of the rapids .  It was the eternal noise at that bend in the river , but on a normal day it could n't be <head>heard</head> here . Now it seemed to come and go on the wind .  At midday ,  when we shut the shop for lunch ,  and I drove through the streets ,  it was only the river ,  glittering in the hard light ,  that seemed alive .

At the beginning of the book a dear friend ,  Charlie ,  another immigrant boy ,  leaves for Russia with his family  for the land ,  they hope ,  of the free .  Ralph strives to address the high heid yins of Russia to solicit news of the family ,  and receives his letter back from the Embassy in London ,  stamped :  Communication not permitted .  And the family was never <head>heard</head> of again . Glasser orders his events thematically ,  while also wanting to tell a story and to spring surprises .  Charlie 's  departure is the first of several ,  and this event is succeeded by the announcement of a further theme when the rabbi 's  thunderings pass over the heads of his congregation and the writer notes :  in later years I would wonder how different my life might have been if a few people ,  those closest to me ,  had  been frightened  just  a little .

Revolution ,  and its betrayal by a regime which both prescribes and proscribes literature ,  are described in both works .  Both men are interested in the subject of remembering and forgetting .  In the books they write , music is <head>heard</head> in country places trumpets , fiddles , the cimbalom and love shows its face in country hotels , pleasant places , set down beside a stretch of water . Klima may perhaps be a common name in Czechoslovakia ,  and Kundera has become a common name in the conversation of Western readers ,  who are drawn to these reciprocal concerns of his .  In the days before glasnost   which his fictions may be thought to have rehearsed and predicted ,  but which could well mean that his fictions will no longer be for the West what they have been so far ,  when the thing that they deplore was still there in its entirety to be deplored  Kundera was forced into exile in the free world of the time .

Patrick has plenty to say on such subjects ,  and he says it in the lordly way which does much to furnish the book with its presiding idiom .  But are we meant to sympathise with what he says ?  Here and elsewhere , the method , for all that Amis would hate to <head>hear</head> it , is dialectical . In the novels I am thinking of he attributes certain ideas to certain characters and utters them in the prevailing manner of the novel ,  while also submitting them to question within it .  He can appear in so doing to have his opinions and to eat them too .

But whether the statement is rhetoric or reality ,  particularly for Mr Charles Haughey and the rest of the Fianna Fil leadership ,  we will have to wait and see .

While preparing an early draft of the present chapter , the writer <head>heard</head> Bishop Cathal Daly of Down and Connor , a leading moderate among the bishops , respected by all except PIRA , repeat the adage that the Irish constitution was secular , implying that there really was little to be done for the moment . This in fact was the main tack in the bishops '  attitude to the forum .  There appears to have been a general feeling among them that there was no real problem on this score .

With the franchise bids for Channel 3 close to completion and the date set for the advertising of Channel 5 franchises it is timely to look again at the possibilities in the new channel ,  and in particular at the potential for city television .  The arguments for the development of the media industries of regional cities has always had both economic and cultural aspects .  The 1991 Forum will look at Channel 5 both as an opportunity to provide employment and economic growth outside of London and the South East and as a means of making the non - metropolitan voice <head>heard</head> . Despite the minimalist parameters for the new channel set out in the Broadcasting Act ,  in profound contrast to the remit of Channel Four when it began a decade ago ,  we want to make an issue of the new Channel .  We see the allocation of the scarce resource of our last terrestrial channel as a matter worth serious discussion ,  and seek in it an answer to the perceived shortcomings of the existing Channels .

Evidently he had decided to finish on a note of grave and reproachful dignity .  For those were troublous times ,  he said on a downward - curving cadence ,  and such times have come again ,  but take heart :  for when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted ,  he said unto Moses ,  There is a noise of war in the camp .  And he said , It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the noise of them that sing do I <head>hear</head> . He finished ,  face raised and eyes closed ,  and at once gave out the final psalm .  Mr Menzies had enunciated them that sing with noticeable pleasure in the resonant properties of the words .
