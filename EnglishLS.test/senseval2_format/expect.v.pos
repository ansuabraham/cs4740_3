These factors help to explain why the total number of clients covered at any one time by our London 24 hour on - call service more than doubled from 70 in April 1990 to 150 by March 1991 ;  and why the provision of service has had to become so much more sophisticated .

Keats placed him among the stars ,  where Keats himself ,  for similar reasons ,  was to be placed by Shelley .  Chatterton became a topos ,  and the numbers lisped :  O Chatterton ,  how very sad thy fate ,  Flow gently ,  sweet Chatterton ,  Good for you ,  Chatterton .  Readers can be <head>expected</head> to spot which of these quotations are forgeries , and they must also have doubted in their time whether this writer was as good as the early tributes made out . It seems clear ,  however ,  that Chatterton needn't have had prodigious talent for the talent expended in the novel to take effect .  It is a novel which communicates the notion that talented and untalented meet in that country of the mind where everyone copies and steals from everyone else ,  where everything is reproductive or reminiscent of everything else ,  where one thing leads to another and this person passes into that .

All knowledge of life and lives ,  and indeed of history ,  is a good in itself ,  and seems likely to inform literary intelligence ;  and in addition Amis 's  novels would rather confuse if thought to be the work of an early Tudor writer .  Beyond this ,  the use of biography ,  its actual ability to throw light  ( rather than just to be entertaining and nice to have around )  ,  seems to be a fantasy .  Kenner 's fantasy is being discussed in terms of the view with which Kenner can be <head>expected</head> to be very familiar that the goals of a biographically - minded criticism are in some measure fantastic . Beyond this ,  however ,  leaves indefinite the point at which ,  or frequency with which ,  the use of biography deserves to be called by that name .  She is saying that this good thing ,  this knowledge ,  can be used  to tell us ,  for example ,  that Amis  is not a Tudor writer :  but she is rather more moved to say at the same time that it ca n't or can hardly be used ,  devoted as she is to the thought of a separation between ,  in this case ,  Amis 's  friendships and politics ,  his life  and his art .

She says ,  too ,  you have to relate the mental intention to the physical action .  Most drama training works on the assumption that there is something called standard English ,  which is generally considered to be the straight delivery of words without affectation or regional variation .  This means that actors are <head>expected</head> to be able to control any regional or foreign accent which is natural to them , and deliver a text in what may best be called the classical style . It does n't mean that your regional accent is going to be bullied out of you ,  so that you are unable to use it ever again  on the contrary ,  your accent may in all probability be your most interesting and valuable possession .  And good voice training will make your natural delivery sound ten times better than when you first started training .

Equity entry is of crucial concern to the large numbers of trained and talented drama school finalists seeking to enter the business every year .

The belief is still popular that such a race exists ,  rather than there merely being a cultural group based on nationalist ,  republican ,  and catholic religious sentiment .

Theoretically , one would <head>expect</head> the Northern catholic community and the six counties of Ulster to be considered a lost remnant , unredeemed from British rule , and indeed this is by far the most popular interpretation .

But there was in any case no doubt that the areas of the family ,  education ,  and public morality constituted part of the sacred sphere .  One explicit guiding principle of papal teaching which came to influence the Irish constitution and successive debates culminating in the church  state imbroglio of 1951 ,  dealt with below ,  was that of subsidiarity :  that no secondary institution such as the state should take on duties which primary and intermediate ones ,  such as the family ,  could assume .  Secondary institutions were also <head>expected</head> to assist primary ones in fulfilling their essential tasks . The principle took on particular importance in the light of the development of totalitarian communism ,  and the Roman church saw the threat to be endemic in the growth of the modern state apparatus ,  including its welfare institutions .  It is also important to notice how easily such a principle supports personal enterprise and property in its contemporary form ,  capitalism .

Pabulum Consultants '  Jennifer Rust comments :  Many companies will only invest in the minimum training required to get the system up and running ;  it is not surprising in these cases that the systems are not being used to their full potential .  Management should regard a full training schedule as part of the total cost of the system and include this total sum in the system 's  payback calculations .  The computer system will only bring the returns that the company <head>expects</head> if the people using it are using the system fully , which can be guaranteed through investment in adequate training . It must also be noted that the computer systems generate information and it is how this information is used that influences the returns on the total package .  The onus is on the company to ensure that staff are making intelligent decisions on the information that the computer system provides and this comes from in - house training .

Susceptibility to high g is greatly affected by the duration of the loading ,  and whereas most people can cope with 3 to 4 g for a few seconds ,  a sustained loading of that amount may cause loss of vision .

It is normal for this sensitivity to remain for a few flights and then gradually to disappear .  After a little more flying experience ,  beginners '  eyes interpret what is happening to the aircraft and the alarm signal is no longer sent on to the brain .  For example , as the stick is moved forwards a little , the eyes see the nose of the glider moving down , and the brain <head>expects</head> the sensation and understands what is happening . As there is no cause for alarm ,  the brain suppresses the sensation at source .  This is another reason to start off any flying training by emphasising visual references instead of the instruments .

He must come to terms with living with this consciousness and with the inherent problems he will face in revealing this knowledge to the outside in an ethnographic account .  Moreover ,  he must come to terms with a new awareness of what he has previously accepted ,  perhaps without thinking ,  which under the intense microscope of social enquiry may well seem to verge on the ludicrous or to be morally indefensible .  And having long been supported by the institution he will be crucially aware that it <head>expects</head> a degree of loyalty verging on deference or acquiescence . In such an archetypal world ,  where good is constantly and insecurely balanced in an eternal struggle against evil ,  the  objective explication of the rituals and symbols which surround and mystify police work can seem tantamount to a treasonable act .  In 1979 ,  James Anderton ,  the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester ,  described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from seditionist interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy  ( Thompson 1979 :  380 )  .

.  Again Douglas  ( 1966 :  138 )  has suggested there is a liaison which exists between the physical body and its use as an expression of the social ,  so that one becomes a paradigm for the other :  the human body is a model which can stand for any bounded system .  It should come as no surprise ,  therefore ,  to find that a well - disciplined human body with clearly defined parameters of correctness will provide a symbolic mirror of the  preferred police social formation in which the human condition can be enacted .  We can also <head>expect</head> to find that any discrepancy in this preferred social formation will be reflected and transferred to the physical body as a metaphor of chaos . These adjacent police forces were physically aberrant in nuance of bodily style and were therefore deemed to be socially incorrect .  In their metaphorical indiscipline they had gained new status and slipped across a boundary into marginality ,  for as Foucault  ( 1977 :  25 )  has suggested ,  the idea of discipline revolves around control of the physical body and proceeds from the distribution of individuals in space it is always the body that is at issue  the body and its forces ,  their utility and their docility ,  their distribution and their punishment .

Steffi Graf never makes excuses ,  never  its her most famous trademark after her forehand !  It would appear otherwise ,  at times ,  due to wording of newspaper articles .  The press apparently had <head>expected</head> Steffi 's invincible reign to last for several years when last year Graf had a bad year ( by her standards ) the men and women of the press understandably searched for reasons for it and voiced them . They were mostly sympathising with her loss of form and her problems .  This is not to be confused with her own personal feelings .

Time ,  even a fraction of it ,  possessed value in producing a better return .  More than coaching fundamentals ,  which Pancho Segura considers a different type of coach than himself ,  he was a coach for the championship performances .  I taught Jimmy the sensation of where to <head>expect</head> the serve of an opponent , plus where to plan to return that shot . I saw two shots ahead of the opponent 's  first shot .  Where could that particular player he was about to confront ,  volley the ball ?

It is ,  however ,  a lovely feeling to be cutting through timber with the slightest of pressure .  With a sharp edge this method of power carving offers a degree of control more difficult to achieve with conventional carving techniques .  I used it for areas hard to reach with chisel and mallet , and <head>expect</head> that when carving delicate work it has the advantage of not disturbing the workpiece with sudden strikes . The MAC750 is a smaller unit than the 650 I tested ,  and is recommended for that more delicate carving .  As a novice carver I found the MAC650 very useful for controlled shaping of curved pieces with flowing lines .

The pockets in the perfect grey limestone became smaller and more spaced ,  the footholds doubtful ,  sloping smears .

Perhaps it was a tiredness resulting from the previous 14 pitches ,  but I could see no way of free climbing it at less than E5 ,  and I was n't good enough for that ,  not now .

What is important is how humans react to it .  You should not tolerate your dog doing something you feel strongly against .  Also , if you allow the dog to sit on your settee , then replace that settee with a new one you do n't want the dog to sit on , you must not <head>expect</head> it to suddenly understand why it cannot sit there . If your dog shows a marked degree of aggression with which you cannot cope ,  you must get it to someone who understands the breed and can help .  If ,  after that ,  you ca n't get it to live amicably in a domestic situation ,  there is not much hope left ,  although Graham stressed he has had some success with temperament improvements by castrating the males .

On the other hand ,  there are those who have only an imperfect formal competence in a language but  who by a combination of guesswork and intuition can somehow make contact with the aesthetic qualities of a foreign poem .  Impressive translations have been made on such a basis ,  though usually by poets .  It is not a quality that it is sensible to <head>expect</head> in the generality of students . For those who do not have much real competence in other languages ,  there is the possibility of coming to terms with poems in the older ,  more remote forms of English .  Chaucer ,  I assume ,  would form part of such a programme anyway .

The other emerges when he remarks in the opening lines the regular yet halting rhythm ,  the smooth uncertainty of movement which may either proceed to greater regularity or fall away into improvisation .  This perception is picked up later ,  more than once ,  as Tate moves through the poem :  subtly and imperceptibly the rhythm has changed ,  there is constant and sudden change of rhythm ,  a broken and distracted rhythm .  If we read Ash - Wednesday through with Tate 's commentary at our elbow , we see at any given point what he means : he has a good ear , as we might <head>expect</head> from his own poems ( which are however metrical , as Ash - Wednesday is n't ) . And we may agree that what binds together the six parts of Ash - Wednesday is in large part something rhythmical .  It remains true that in Tate 's  criticism and since  ( for no advance has been made in this quarter )  rhythm and movement are wholly impressionistic  you hear what the critic is talking about ,  or else you do n't .

But quality teas ,  the best grade ,  have hardly changed at around 200p a kilogramme .  The rise is particularly interesting because it confounded expectations .

At the beginning of the year ,  however ,  the trend argument was much more plausible than it is today .  World production of tea  ( black and green )  grew from 2.27m tonnes in 1985 to 2.34m tonnes in 1987 ,  and rose again in 1988 .

Even if other antinuclear fundamentalists threaten to fight ,  fight and fight again ,  Mr Kinnock need have no fear .  The more firmly he tells them and the country that ,  as Prime Minister ,  he and not they will rule ,  the more likely it is that he will eventually reach Downing Street .

Although the policy review will be endorsed by the conference ,  giving Neil Kinnock the freedom to go on to the offensive against the Conservatives in the run - up to the next general election ,  there are a number of areas of potential conflict .

Ron Todd ,  the general secretary of the transport workers '  union ,  said that today 's  vote on the multilaterist nuclear defence policy would not yield the massive and overwhelming majority predicted by right - wingers ,  and he warned that party leaders could not expect everybody to goose - step in the same direction once the policy had been carried .

The deal will lift its share of the Spanish soft drinks market from 8 to 10 per cent and of the Portuguese market from 3 to 8 per cent .  The price paid for the acquisition ,  including a fruit plant near Valencia and a bottling plant in Barcelona ,  appears high since the businesses being acquired had sales of 29.6m in 1988 and trading profits of 2.2m ,  implying a p/e on conventional terms of almost 30 .  But Cadbury Schweppes , which last month completed the 141m purchase of Crush International from Procter Gamble , says the brand values being acquired justified the price and it <head>expects</head> to find synergy benefits with its own extensive bottling operations in Spain and Portugal . The Crush purchase boosted Cadbury Schweppes '  soft drinks volumes by 30 per cent to over four billion litres a year ,  which places it third equal with Dr Pepper - Seven Up behind Coca - Cola 's  46.5 billion litres and Pepsi 's  21.5 billion litres .

If the buyout , which is <head>expected</head> to offer about 160m for the Haig and Claymore whisky group , is completed before that date , Grand Met 's option would lapse . Brent Walker said it expected the buyout negotiations would be successfully completed shortly .  Brent Walker bought Whyte  Mackay from Lonrho earlier this year for 180m in a deal that included four French vineyards ,  which are also for sale for as much as 60m .
