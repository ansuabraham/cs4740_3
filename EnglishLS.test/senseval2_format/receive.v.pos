In response ,  AI sent out information packs on the case of Nahamn and people to write letters to the relevant authorities .  With letters still coming in ,  AI will be sending out information on other street children 's  cases in Guatemala  many of Nahamn 's  friends who witnessed the attack have been subjected to harassment from the police .

LETTERS DISTURBING MEASURES I have just <head>received</head> David Bull 's appeal for funds , with the short version of Amnesty 's report on Human Rights Violations in Iraqi Occupied Kuwait ( since August 1990 ) enclosed . I am afraid that by taking the extraordinary measure of stapling this report because some of the contents are so disturbing ,  Amnesty has again given credence to the belief that recent torture in Kuwait has been more terrible than in any other part of the world ,  whereas the repugnant patterns of pain - infliction described are all too familiar from Iran ,  from Myanmar ,  Amin 's  Uganda ,  a South America ,  South Africa etc. Although we may claim that we simply publish an objective report ,  the inference that exceptional evil existed during the occupation of Kuwait will naturally be made by those trying to justify the devastating Allied bombardment of Iraq ,  now retrospectively .

Unfortunately ,  it is often difficult to get agents to attend these productions .  Most drama schools final productions are staged over a similar sort of  schedule ,  which means agents are asked to see students '  work over a fairly compressed period .  Agents are notified of performances by the schools , and they also <head>receive</head> hundreds of letters from students inviting them to see particular performances . Remember ,  though ,  that badgering agents is quite useless ;  if they want to come they will come ,  but telephoning them and overselling yourself can be just as useless as not letting them know that you 're alive and working .  It will be the same story for many moons to come .

However ,  it suggested that the October holiday should replace an existing holiday .  Angus Crichton - Miller ,  managing director of the Rank Organisation 's  holidays and hotels division and a member of the study group said :  It is not an efficient system to have such changes between busy and quiet periods and it would be better if we could flatten prices over a longer season ,  rather than have such high - peak - season prices .  The October bank holiday proposal has <head>received</head> a muted response from Employment Minister Michael Howard , who said he was open to persuasion but had no plans to make changes . As well as suggesting an autumn boost for the tourism industry ,  the group also proposed changes at the beginning of the season by introducing a fixed - date Easter holiday .  By creating a more definite starting and finishing point to the season ,  members of the group believed that the growing trend of out - of - season holidays and short breaks could be accelerated .

Any suggestions for improvements in communications or any critical findings it may have contained were negated by institutional neglect and the silence which Arendt  ( 1958 )  argues is a primary tool of authority operated to effect !

They will normally be worked out automatically but see also Extra help for former non - ratepayers '  below .

In most cases the rates used in the calculation will be the same amount as the actual bill you <head>received</head> in 198990 . However this will not be the case if you no longer live in the property where you previously paid rates because it is the 198990 rates of the property where you now live which is used to calculate any reduction .  If you move on or after the 1st April 1991 you will normally lose the reduction although there are certain circumstances when this is not the case .

Railborne steel traffic suffered in proportion to the cutbacks in the steel industry itself ,  with complete withdrawal from one or two locations such as Consett in County Durham .  Interestingly ,  though ,  Railfreight also derived some benefit from the contraction of British Steel 's  steel - making activities .  The concentration of blast furnaces at a smaller number of plants meant that the rolling mills at Corby and Shotton , for example , would henceforth <head>receive</head> their raw steel from other parts of the country . This provided Railfreight with valuable contracts for long - distance bulk coil traffic ,  traffic which would not have materialised if the steel industry had survived the 1980s unscathed .  Another area of growth within the Metals sub - sector has been finished bright steel or cold reduced coil .
