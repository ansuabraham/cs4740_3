At no time will this be more true than in the 1990s ,  when the art critic confronts an increasingly international community of art .  Of course ,  surveys will continue to be written about American painting or German art ,  British sculpture or Australian print - making ;  this fact of publication does not mean that these activities have an inner coherence .  Any reader is entitled to ask what purpose such national anthologies serve ; their best justification is making art more accessible , enabling those living artists represented to find and hold on to <head>audiences</head> for their work . The reader can beware of an element of self - interest in such anthologies ,  whether in the form of books or exhibitions .  For one thing ,  a government agency may have commercial or political aims in commissioning surveys or anthologies .

The standards which can be obtained in colour reproductions today are high ,  but not always attained .  Comparison of illustrations of the same picture in several publications will demonstrate this truism ,  while the best test of looking at a reproduction in front of the picture itself can be a disheartening experience .  A lecture <head>audience</head> looking at a slide projection , incidentally , may also suffer from seeing distorted colours , though art museums take some care to sell transparencies of a satisfactory quality . Considerations of illustrations aside ,  the reader will be hoping for enlightenment from the text .  It is probable that this will have much to offer .

The quotation is from an article of 1954 ,  at a time when Picasso 's  reputation was very high .  Heron was anxious to point out Braque 's  qualities ,  so he trailed his coat openly .   To suggest , as I do , that Georges Braque is the greatest living painter is to remind a contemporary <head>audience</head> , fed to satiety on brilliant innovation , frenzied novelty and every sort of spontaneous expression , that , after all , permanence , grandeur , deliberation , lucidity and calm are paramount virtues of the art of painting The rival genius of Picasso has proved to the world that our age may be epitomized by works which  ( show )  his unfailing sense of visual drama ,  his protean invention and his power of investing his creations with a hallucinatory poetry .  Heron shows in his article a deep sympathy with Braque 's  work ,  which ,  incidentally ,  was a sort of painting he himself was seeking to practise at the time .

This is as unsatisfactory as reading about a picture which is not illustrated .  The crux of a personality article is that it aims to satisfy a reader 's  curiosity .  An editor 's directions to the writer of an article may be to take a populist approach , suitable for a wide <head>audience</head> . The article written to this brief is likely to have an element of sensationalism ;  curiosity about sex or money may be deliberately aroused ;  conflicts in an artist 's  life are likely to be dramatised .  An amusing parallel in the film business is an account given by the director Ken Russell of how he sold the idea of making a film about Tchaikowsky ;  he described it to his potential backers as the story of a homosexual who fell in love with a nymphomaniac .

Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage  the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the audience are vitally connected to what is going on .  As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself ,  and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for .  Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 , scene 1 of Henry V , which draws the <head>audience</head> into the atmosphere before a battle enormously effectively ) . It is also used as a dramatic device by many contemporary playwrights .   The film is a very distinct dramatic medium .

Depending on the school ,  a full term 's  work of ten to twelve weeks may be spent on one production project during the first term ,  with either a workshop or text study area at the end of the period .

a tribute to muriel box  ( 19051991 )  It was to her own surprise that Muriel Box ,  the director of 14 modest budget feature films between 1951 and 1964 ,  found herself an inspiration and a role model for a new generation of women film - makers ,  critics and students .

Her first husband was Sydney Box ,  the writer - director who became head of production at Gainsborough Studios ;  and her sister - in - law was the Miss Box Office who produced the wildly successful DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE films over two decades .  But Muriel 's  climb to film direction was slow and gradual ,  and she began her apprenticeship as a typist and then continuity girl ,  rising throughout the studio hierarchy .

These labels prove to be wholly inadequate ,  not to say misleading ,  for a film - maker who managed to bring together Indian mythological symbolism ,  folk and musical traditions in order to raise questions about identity ,  nation ,  race ,  and class in a unparalleled way .

Amongst the most important of these carefully plotted works are :  de Falla 's  The  Three - Cornered Hat   ( 1919 )  which originally accompanied a mime play and so fascinated Diaghilev that he commissioned the composer to enlarge it for Massine 's  ballet  ( see page 59 )  ;  Vaughan William 's  Job ,  commissioned by Diaghilev ,  was unused until de Valois created her important Masque for Dancing  ( 1931 )   ( this marked the inaugural performance of what has become The Royal Ballet )  ;  Arthur Bliss '  Checkmate   ( 1937 )  was choreographed by de Valois after both composer and choreographer had worked on the plot ;  Prokofiev 's  Romeo and Juliet  was composed with the help of a Shakespearean theatre expert and has been used notably by Lavrovsky ,  Ashton and MacMillan  ( see page 26 )  ;  and Ashton provided a roughly outlined plot for Hans Werner Henze 's  score for Ondine   ( 1958 )  .  But standing out above all are the scores commissioned from Stravinsky by Balanchine ,  such as Apollo ,  Orpheus  and Card Game  .  During the third phase of his enterprise Diaghilev realised the need to keep up with the tastes of his wealthy <head>audiences</head> always anxious to be in fashion and commissioned works from members of the group known as Les Six . These were Milhaud ,  Poulenc and Auric whose music greatly influenced many later composers such as William Walton and Constant Lambert ,  many of their works remain in constant use today as witness MacMillan 's  moving interpretation of Poulenc 's  Gloria  .  When choreographers decide to commission music ,  they should first give the composer an outline of the plot ,  roughly suggesting the sequence of the action ,  the likely entrances and exits for the characters and the dances or brief scenes in which they are involved .

But there is no such careful blending of ingredients in Tetley 's  Dances of Albion  where the singer 's  words of the traditional Lye Wake Dirge bore no relation to what was being danced on stage .  This was offensive to the Scots in the audience as was Tetley 's  disregard for the purport of the poem by Blake that gave the ballet its title .  The music by Benjamin Britten includes some part of the War Requiem which means far more to British <head>audiences</head> than mere decorative patterning . Choreographers have never disdained to use popular music for their everincreasing audiences and they realise that they should reflect popular taste .  The score for La Fille Mal Garde   ( 1789 )  reflected the new revolutionary ideas pervading France and contained several folk and popular airs .

The ballet works itself out consistently as a design ,  reproducing in the subtlest way the design of the music in the matter of subject ,  repetitions ,  balancings ,  treatment of episodes and so on .  In the last resort ,  the more musical we are and the better we know Brahms ,  the more pleasure we derive from Choreartium  .  Ernest Newman 's remarks stress that choreographers creating dance to their own choice of music must study how the composer has structured his score and try to understand what he intended the <head>audience</head> to hear and feel , whether it be played , or played and sung . Choreographers have to create dance movements which make their response to the music visible before the performers can communicate the music .  A socalled abstract or dance ballet has to be both thought and felt if the partnership between the often - dead composer and the living interpreters is to make sense .

Fokine echoed this remark when he said every step and pose is a gesture  ( see page 58 )  .  De Valois summed up the ideas of these two great choreographers by saying :  Only synchronisation of arms and legs will give symmetry to step and pose ,  strength to the jump ,  speed to the pirouettes  ,  calm to the adage and spaciousness to the dance .  To ensure that his <head>audience</head> would appreciate each sentence in his dance , petipa usually repeated each at least twice and usually four times . But towards the end of the second or fourth repeat he made some small alteration in the ports de bras  so that the dancer could move easily into the next sentence .  He did this without ever losing sight of the contrasts he made between steps of each sequence because these were controlled by the particular rhythm ,  tempo and quality of the music .

A choreographer working in the classical style is wise to conform to the traditional principles and rules found valuable through years of experience .  They are based on a refinement of the natural movements made by the bones and joints when activated by the muscles ,  tendons and ligaments found in any human body .  The movements were and still are practised because they are designed to display the body as it moves to the best advantage from the <head>audience</head> 's point of view . They were and still are designed to give that style of dance spaciousness ,  calm ,  balance and grace of form so that the lines drawn during the transition from one step an/or pose to another fills the available space in every dimension .  In every enchanement  each step an/or pose must be given its appropriate value by way of beginning ,  climax and end so that its place is justified by its importance to the whole sentence .

Another old rule decreed that dancers never turned their backs on the audience ,  because all had to face the king ,  the centre of attention .  The turn of a dancer 's  back can now become part of a beautiful line being made in a total picture .  Today 's dancers not only dance fur an <head>audience</head> . They also dance for and with each other. And it is their response to each other 's  movements and their own enjoyment in dance that makes their behaviour appear natural and spontaneous even when they perform difficult technical feats .

Ashton and MacMillan adopt the same practice in their ballets which can be called classical in the court meaning of the term and whenever the music used is composed according to the formulae for classical composition .  They do this even though they may break the conventions from time to time .  They do it because they know the <head>audience</head> is watching a constantly evolving picture which is being drawn on , over , across and above a flat stage in front of a background . They know they must fill the empty space with movement ,  whether there is scenery in the background or where the costumes are at their simplest and the background merely a hint of some venue as ,  for example ,  in Symphonic Variations  or Requiem  ,  or even just shafts of light as in Monotones  .  It is useful for would - be choreographers to study the historical development of classical style so that they may stage a ballet in a traditional way when it has a story firmly linked to a particular time and place .

They had to adapt their movements to cover a larger space which was like a box with one side only being open to public gaze .  They had to pay greater attention to the placing of each step and pose within the new framework .  Much time was spent in the formulation of rules to lay down the alignments and aulements which would best display each movement from the <head>audience</head> 's point of view . These rules still hold good for choreographers who work in the classical medium and the wise ones never neglect them .  If they do ,  their design loses the calm spaciousness which the style demands ,  no matter how fast or slow the dance .

Perhaps the best example fur choreographers to study - is Petipa 's  work for the corps de ballet  ,  particularly in La Bayadre   ( Scene of the Shades )  .  As the thirty - six girls enter one by one down the ramp at the back of the stage and move into six straight lines across the stage until it is completely filled ,  there is one continually progressing line of arabesques  and ports de bras  .  This demonstrates what can be done with two simple movements to hold an <head>audience</head> 's attention . Later the mass of dancers merely moves upstage sur les pointes  to a pose and further ports de  bras  ,  then returns downstage to another slowly unfolding set of ports de bras  and arabesques  .  It is when this mass of dancers divides and moves to the sides that the open space available for dancing is exposed fur the first time .

By so doing he originated a style of dance which owed its liveliness to the way such people behaved and danced in real life .  Even so ,  he did not fully dispense with the technique of the classical school .  He realised , as did later choreographers , that the steps and patterns of such material had to be properly displayed to the <head>audience</head> , not just danced for themselves . In other words he opened up the circles ,  squares and longways sets to show what gave rhythm and life to the movements .  It is this opening up and exposure of traditional dance that is so important when choreographers attempt to give a realistic atmosphere to the style and expression of their work .

Nineteenth - century choreographers creating either a character or a national ballet used both occupational and natural emotional gesture in their dance designs .

This English pantomime tradition Ashton also exploited earlier in his choreography for the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella  where he followed the tradition that one is always a somewhat modest violet bossed about by her dragon of a sister .  This double characterisation was made more hilarious at the first performances when the bossy one was danced by Helpmann ,  and later the taller MacMillan ,  with wonderfully extended dvelopps  ,  and the shyer one by Ashton with dainty attempts to be correct at all costs .  A similar incongruous matching of the very tall girl with one of the shortest boys in MacMillan 's Elite Syncopations reveals that he , too , understands that old music - hall and pantomime practices are a wonderful source of inspiration if a British <head>audience</head> is to laugh and enjoy the occasion as the dancers do . Another commedia dell'arte character whose play has influenced too few choreographers is that of Harlequin ,  a maker of mischief ,  a magicker of spells ,  an animal impersonator and always a great dancer .  Fokine 's  Harlequin only gives a glimpse of his abilities .

Yet the above ballets are different again from de Valois '  The Rake 's  Progress  ,  which was based on the reality of Hogarth 's  pictures .  When these pictures were issued they were indeed contemporary because they were based on the evils of the day .  Today 's <head>audiences</head> find them old - fashioned : yet many modern ballets deal with similar evils such as present - day problems with drugs , AIDS , mental handicap , racism , imprisonment and so on , in which the balletic interpretation makes the same impression if the choreographer has really studied the themes outlined in his subject . These choreographers must create movements which display each protagonist 's  particular behaviour and reactions .  Too often their movements are insufficiently defined because too much effort is made to shock ,  unlike the tightly controlled movements of characters in The Rake 's  Progress  and A Distant Drummer  .

By PATRICIA WYNN DAVIES ,  Legal Correspondent BARRISTERS could retain much of their monopoly over advocacy in the higher courts under a subtle agenda for discussion spelled out by Lord Donaldson ,  the Master of the Rolls ,  as he opened the Bar 's  annual conference in London at the weekend .  Signalling the beginning of a lower - key campaign against the plans of the Lord Chancellor , Lord Mackay of Clashfern , to give increased rights of <head>audience</head> in the High and Crown court to solicitors , Lord Donaldson called on the Bar to put aside the trauma , the acrimony and the recriminations which followed Lord Mackay 's Green Papers and to abandon the hustings . Lord Donaldson said objectives due to be included in this autumn 's  Bill were total freedom of choice for the client ,  unless the interests of justice otherwise require .  When those concerned turn their attention to this problem ,  they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public interest in the result and that in which the public interest is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available .

In practice ,  initial drafts of rules will be the subject of ongoing discussions between all four parties .  The four will have to have regard to the interest of justice objective .  But on the other hand , the statute will also include a clear intention that extended rights of <head>audience</head> are put into practical effect as soon as the necessary conditions have been met . A majority of judges said in their response to the Green Papers that standards of conduct and competence might decline if lawyers who worked in partnerships and took instructions directly from clients  ( most solicitors )  were allowed widespread access to the higher courts .  Lord Donaldson 's  formula for settling the rights of audience controversy was viewed as an adept political move by some delegates .

Doolittle has based himself on what seems a pellucidly consequential and intelligently written play by Rex Deverell  ( also the librettist )  ;  and though the piece is offered as best suited to alternative audiences ,  it cuts an oddly respectable figure in the modestly louche surroundings of Chapter .  Two reasons strike me for this .  First , the work is dramaturgically polite ; it consults its <head>audience</head> too much to be taken seriously as drop - out theatre . And secondly ,  its music is too operatic  too Brittenesque  to excite us searching spirits who trek through gaslit suburbs in quest of aesthetic deprivation .  Like the artists in La Boheme ,  Aggie and Sprugg  Deverell 's  two winos  -  spend a good deal of time play - acting ,  in an operative sort of way .

A part of the myth just did n't work after that .  At their peak in the mid - 60s ,  there were 39 western series on the three American TV networks  almost two a day on each channel .  In the US weekly <head>audience</head> ratings in 1965 , there were three westerns in the top five , and seven in the top 10 . By the mid - 80s they had all gone the way of the buffalo :  extinct save for preservation in the national park of permanent re - runs .  Gene Autry ,  the first TV cowboy ,  now 82 ,  says westerns dominated the early days of TV partly because they had lively ,  cheaply produced visuals ,  but mainly because early TV was starved of feature films by the studios .

'  Within seconds ,  the locals started buying the poets round after round of whisky ,  quoting enthusiastically from MacDiarmid 's  work .  It seems no more than a charming anecdote ,  but when Professor Davie cites Bunting 's  tale in Under Briggflatts ,  his history of British poetry since 1960 ,  he calls the incident challenging .  What prompts him to this unexpected adjective is that ( as Bunting stressed ) the poems these men admired were not simplified to aim at the poor , but written for a hard intellectual <head>audience</head> . But there are further reasons for his choice of qualifier ,  and they involve Davie in cultural as well as literary criticism .  Though its accounts of individual poems are as searching as anything in Davie 's  earlier books  ( we owe Carcanet a debt :  this is to be the first in a uniform edition of Davie 's  work )  ,  Under Briggflatts is also a mordant and compelling history of the social climates to which these poems were a response .

Going Out to Galleries :  Dalya Alberge selects some of the artists and installations selected for the National Review of Live Art By DALYA ALBERGE BEER tipped on a member of the <head>audience</head> is not everyone 's idea of art , let alone a joke .

Needless to say ,  that artist was not selected by Nikki Milican  the festival 's  director  who attended hundreds of events up and down the country .

Needless to say ,  that artist was not selected by Nikki Milican  the festival 's  director  who attended hundreds of events up and down the country .  I saw some appalling things .  It 's extraordinary that you still find performers assaulting the <head>audience</head> , commenting on anarchy and art . That 's  so tired and boring .  Nineteen artists offer installations and performance art .

The subject under discussion is that old chestnut ,  public or private financing of the arts ,  but there is a particularly exciting line - up of speakers to chew the cud .  Terry Hands ,  retiring director of the RSC ,  will be facing up to Douglas Mason of the Adam Smith Institute ,  whose Expounding The Arts has been one of the most interesting discussion documents of recent years .  Thomas Sutcliffe , Arts Editor of The Independent , will be chairing the debate which will be thrown open to an <head>audience</head> including Ian McKellen , David Puttnam and Ned Sherrin . John Sessions  ( above )  will open the afternoon with a specially written piece on this contentious subject .  The debate begins at 3.00 and tickets are available from the Almeida box office on 01 - 359 4404 .

Strictly speaking ,  this last description is accurate .  The conductor 's  role ,  after all ,  is silent .  The <head>audience</head> sits mesmerised by his expressive choreography , watching each inflection of the hand or eyebrow . We almost convince ourselves that the music is created not by the orchestra but by the tip of the baton itself ,  rich sounds oozing out like some exotic genie .  Yet not so long ago orchestras managed perfectly happily without this apparently indispensable Merlin .

Avuncular and sociable ,  he was a warm and friendly person who might be encountered conducting a Women 's  Institute choir ,  accompanying an audition at the piano ,  as a freelance organist or providing harpsichord continuo .  As a bass ,  his appearances in the choir at the Three Choirs Festivals found a singer who could really get the bottom notes .  By the wider public he will be remembered as a composer whose style , founded in practical music - making , has an immediate appeal which rewards both performers and <head>audiences</head> . He more or less started the Gloucester County Youth Orchestra ,  which he conducted for 13 years ,  as well as running the County Music Summer Schools .  These activities gave him an enduring influence in the development of young musicians .

The format of the traditional choral suite with soloist is also reflected in the light - hearted Good Company for baritone ,  chorus and orchestra  ( 1964 )  ,  and later in The Celestial City written for Adrian Beaumont and the Bristol Bach Choir in 1977 .  Hewitt - Jones also wrote orchestral music ,  including a Sinfonietta for Strings  ( 1959 )  ,  concertos for oboe ,  for clarinet and for trumpet  ( 1966 ,  1968 ,  1976 )  ,  the first and last being works of considerable substance and worthwhile additions to somewhat restricted repertoires .  While not primarily a composer of chamber music , his substantial Piano Trio performed by the Joubert Trio in 1985 , would appeal to a wide <head>audience</head> . The majority of his music was written for particular occasions ,  for performers known to him or in memory of friends and colleagues .  Possibly the best known of these is the Mass of Reconciliation written for Coventry 25 years after the bombing  ( a service which appeared on disc )  ,  and his association with the Three Choirs Festival which included his Te Deum in 1962 ,  his setting of Let Us Now Praise Famous Men at the opening service in 1977 ,  and the Benedicite  ( in memory of Cecil Adams )  in 1986 .

His own contribution was sober and only occasionally spiced with alternative wit .  There was no attempt to liken any Conservative minister ,  or downtrodden Chancellor ,  to Baldrick or anyone else .  But his mere appearance ensured a packed <head>audience</head> , eager for anything approaching intentional humour at their party conference . In this respect ,  Kenneth Baker 's  jocular early reference to Labour 's  Gould mine of political gaffes may conceivably have fallen a little short .  Only the organist in the conference hall seemed to be properly tuned - in ,  belting out a rendition of Bewitched ,  bothered and bewildered as the representatives filed in for their annual law and order debate .

Yet subsequent projects revealed an almost unerring instinct for commercial blackspots .  The album of music for the film Mike 's  Murder was left looking limp after John Barry had been hired ,  at the last minute ,  to replace sizeable parts of Jackson 's  score on the actual soundtrack .  Then there was the three - sided live LP , Big World ( 1986 ) , during the recording of which the <head>audience</head> was asked to observe silence . And the accounts department at AM probably stopped short of throwing a party when Jackson delivered the tapes for 1987 's  Will Power ,  an orchestral instrumental album .  ( 'I got called pretentious for that ,  but you have to watch the rock n roll posing on MTV to see people really taking themselves seriously .   '

It seemed to be genuine .  The speaker who complained at the burden on small businesses was clapped by just a handful .  For lengthy passages of the Chancellor 's speech , while Mr Lawson addressed his wider <head>audience</head> in the City and the country at large , their on - cue responses seemed more mechanical than enthusiastic . The acclaim was loudest ,  and most heartfelt ,  when Mr Lawson derided the inability of the Opposition to offer a convincing alternative formula .  Outside ,  Tory representatives were ambushed by camera crews and reporters ,  and nearly all strove to re - echo Mr Lawson 's  message in fulsome terms .

By STEPHEN GOODWIN LABOUR'S new arms policy was condemned by Tom King yesterday as an appalling shambles which would cripple Britain 's  conventional forces ,  scrub nuclear weapons and leave the country well and truly defenceless .  The Secretary of State for Defence roused his <head>audience</head> with a fierce attack on Labour over its Brighton conference decisions on defence and the appearance at a fringe meeting there of Gerry Adams , the Sinn Fein leader . The country should recognise what some members of the new model Labour party were like ,  Mr King said .  They are the ones who invited Mr Adams to address them just 500 yards from the Grand Hotel which some of us have cause to remember ;  to address them less than two weeks after the time when ,  along the coast at Deal ,  10 young musicians in the Royal Marines were foully murdered .

The speech consisted of little more than bullish assertions of the underlying dynamism and strength of the British economy .  When the final draft was completed ,  shortly after midnight in his suite at the Imperial Hotel ,  it was made known that he would have nothing to say to markets on this occasion .  His sole purpose was to defend his stewardship and reaffirm his policy before the <head>audience</head> of the loyal in the ballroom of the Winter Gardens . If he has other things to say they will be said at Mansion House next Thursday ,  an occasion by tradition for the Chancellor to speak on monetary policy .  Glaringly absent from yesterday 's  speech were any mention of the balance of payments ,  the recent excitement on the money markets ,  exchange rate policy or the European Monetary System .

The same has happened at the Department of the Environment :  Christopher Patten has conducted himself this week as the antithesis of an ideologue .  No such retreat exists with the economy  ( though Mr Lawson did abandon pure monetarism )  .  Ministers can merely attack the Labour Party : the only passage in Mr Lawson 's speech on Thursday which moved his <head>audience</head> to genuine enthusiasm was his attack on Neil Kinnock . Labour is ,  however ,  becoming a less vulnerable target .  To deride the party 's  mass conversion from its former belief ,  as Mrs Thatcher did yesterday ,  raises a cheer from committed Conservatives ,  but floating voters may reckon that it is intelligent to abandon wrong - headed policies .

The only area an exile hopes to cultivate is what the Americans call the chicken and peas circuit  those endless dinners ,  lunches and buffet suppers by which the Conservative Party binds its supporters in a form of social cement out in the sticks .  By now Heseltine has probably got about as much mileage out of such occasions as he can reasonably expect .  He has certainly demonstrated that he is a draw : there must already be some 250 Conservative MPs in his debt for turning out an <head>audience</head> at least double that which they would otherwise have been able to collect . Part of the Heseltine strategy is ,  no doubt ,  based on the calculation that these debts one day can be collected  and certainly ,  within the Conservative Party 's  electoral college of MPs ,  he ought to have established some impressive lines of credit .  It is a nave aspirant party leader ,  though ,  who pins his faith to gratitude .

This knowledge is also recursive ,  in that the competent policeman or woman needs to know which criminals have a common - sense knowledge about the activities and deployment of the police ,  which requires that they have the additional common sense to confound the criminal 's  working knowledge of the police .  Hence a policeman is only as good as his interest in his and surrounding areas  ( FN 30/11/87 ,  p. 28 )  .  The field - worker was a captive <head>audience</head> to whom members of the force could display their competence when riding around Easton in a police vehicle , and conversations were punctuated by policemen pointing out significant sites and personnel . So ,  too ,  were new recruits and staff transferred from outside the area .  However ,  the dissemination of this knowledge to newcomers has the additional purpose of inculcating in them the common sense that is necessary to police Easton .

Different elements of the media perform different functions .  From what we know about their audience and their content ,  we would expect major differences between the influence of television and the influence of the press ,  and major differences also between the influence of highbrow and lowbrow sources .  If they have any influence at all , different media sources should influence their <head>audiences</head> in different ways . THE EXPECTED INFLUENCE OF TELEVISION Television news has three significant characteristics that affect its ability to influence the electorate .

We need to distinguish between different elements of the media ,  and between the media 's  ability to inform and its ability to persuade .  In this chapter we have looked at influences on public perceptions of politics ,  not at influences upon attitudes .  From what we already knew about its <head>audiences</head> and programme content , we expected that television would have a stronger influence on public information and perceptions than on public attitudes and choices ; while the press , particularly the mass - selling tabloids , would have a stronger influence on public attitudes and choices than on public information and perceptions . Television news was pervasive ,  undifferentiated ,  and relatively unbiased .  It proved immensely effective at communicating party campaign themes to the electorate ,  but in the short span of an election campaign it had only a small influence on the public 's  issue - agenda .

Public perceptions that the election was increasingly a two - horse race matched trends in published opinion polls but preceded television 's  switch towards marginalizing the Alliance by focusing on two - party controversy .  Except in so far as they publicized opinion poll findings ,  television projections of party credibility did not dictate public perceptions .  In contrast to television , the press was highly differentiated : different papers reached very different <head>audiences</head> with very different messages . While the pervasiveness and uniformity of television news made it unlikely that it would influence different people in different ways ,  the press seemed likely to influence different readers in very different ways .  Since political bias was so much a characteristic of the press we might expect its influence to be more apparent in terms of attitudes than perceptions ,  however .

While new technology has reduced the costs of entry into newspaper publishing ,  its main effect has been to improve the profitability of established press barons .  The range of newspapers read by the bulk of the British electorate has narrowed sharply over the last two decades  in terms of the political partisanship of mass - selling papers ,  if not in terms of the proliferation of low - circulation titles  ( Newton ,  1988a ,  p. 320 ;  Tunstall ,  1983 ,  p. 12 )  .  Indeed , with the exception of Atlanta 's Cable News Network , seen by a very small <head>audience</head> in Britain , even the introduction of new television technology has so far only extended the reach ( if not the profitability ) of Britain 's existing press barons . Of course ,  it can be argued that readers get the paper that they want or deserve .  As Whale  ( 1977 ,  p. 84 )  argues :  It is readers who determine the character of newspapers .

Highbrow television ,  however ,  reached the politically interested almost irrespective of their  education level .  These variations in media use suggest that radio and the press provide a choice of detail which matches the demands of different sectors of the public  in keeping with the Libertarian Ideal .  At the same time the <head>audience</head> pattern for highbrow television news seems more in keeping with the Public Service Ideal : reaching out to the interested public irrespective of social background . There was much less choice in terms of the media 's  political partisanship .  Only the Guardian  amongst the qualities and the Mirror   ( with its Scottish stable - mate ,  the Record )  amongst the tabloids could be considered even moderately left - wing in 1987 .

He spoke of the way Britain failed to take care of the environment and lamented the creeping of towns and the vanishing of the fields and hedgerows ,  not so much because of the animals as because of the air and the nature of man and the liberty of the soul .  He had one side of him ,  in those days ,  which suspected modern science because of its part in the process of industrialization ,  and its philistine attitude ,  as he supposed ,  to literature .  He bewildered his <head>audience</head> for a moment , and then moved them , when he suddenly turned a political invective about government 's neglect of the environment into a lament that one of the sad losses was going to be the poetry of the countryside , the pastorals of a Vergil or a Theocritus . He would be keener ,  thought one young observer ,  upon reviving perishing literature than a perishing political party .  In the Union he was very popular .
