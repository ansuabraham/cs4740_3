He must wait till the poison had all gone .  Then he  could think back over the rising and understand and admit its weaknesses and set himself to imagine a better future This small piece of reasoning was as frail as wormwood memories welled and streamed in his head , <head>washing</head> away all effort at steady thinking . Colberg galled him most  the officer 's  gentlemanly aplomb helping him to swim like an eel under and between the weapons of a thousand angry people .  Colberg was confident  .

I wanted their approval ,  even if they did smell so terrible ,   the reek of their hair in its stiff ,  bright tufts mixing with the fumes of alcohol .  I began to alter my standards of hospitality ,  offering them my pale ,  cold face when their music grew louder ,  when they began laughing among themselves and did n't take the trouble to explain their jokes to me as they had before ,  or repeat their words until I understood what they were saying .  The English boy showed the others all the implements and products I had collected for cleaning and disinfecting , telling them I had a mania for cleanliness , and I 'd once decided to <head>wash</head> all his clothes and he 'd had to stay indoors the whole day . I felt revolted by them and began to sleep in the hall ,  dragging a pillow and a wool blanket off the bed and leaving the room to them ,  in the hope that they would understand my anger ,  that they would no longer stay till the early hours of the morning ,  stepping over me as I lay asleep ,  leaving overflowing ashtrays and empty glasses and cans and bottles strewn about the floor .  Sometimes they were so drunk they fell asleep where they were and lay without pillows or covers until I returned from work ,  and then I would rage at them in Arabic ,  telling them that thanks to them my room was no better than the Italian 's  pigsty at home ;  we used to spit on the ground whenever we went near it ,  children and grownups alike ,  shouting exclamations of disgust ,  even though all we could see of it was the outer fence .

I had a meal as a guest of the French Padre and two other Commandos ,  in a fairly large dug - out .  The meal was excellent .  I had no idea what it was , but it certainly tasted good , all being <head>washed</head> down with a very good red wine . I have learned very quickly since landing in Normandy to eat  and drink what is offered ,  with no questions asked .  The Padre sitting opposite me had a rifle across his knees ,  the rifle not in keeping with his rather mild manner and angelic face .

The last words that I heard were ,  Good night ,  Piper ,  I shall leave the door open .  Six - thirty a.m. next morning the Sergeant woke me with a very loud ,  Good morning ,  Piper ,  and ,  placing a mug of cocoa on the floor beside me ,  he went back to his office .  After a wash and shave , then breakfast a roll containing a fried egg <head>washed</head> down with one more mug of cocoa I wondered what had happened to his tea rations .

They say she 's  wild after him. She goes every evening to the post ,  and they began to laugh again at what they saw as a mocking mirror of their own flowering .  Moran took the small blue Ford out of the shed after Mass on Sunday , tested the engine and tyres , then <head>washed</head> the car down , dried it and waxed it till it shone . At three o'clock he drove the four miles to Rose Brady 's  house .  The lane into the house was narrow and winding with too many gates so he parked the car on the wide grass margin beside the platform for the creamery cans .

Amid it all was their constant awareness of Moran 's  watching presence ,  sharpening everything they did with the danger of letting something fall and break and bring the weight of his disapproval into the small chain .  All their movements were based more on habit and instinct and fear than any real threat but none the less it was an actual physical state .  They would <head>wash</head> up the same way even if they were not watched . As looking down from great heights brings the urge to fall and end the terror of falling ,  so his very watching put pressure on them to make a slip as they dried and stacked the plates and cups .  There were several alarms ,  bringing laughing giggles of relief when they came to nothing .

The National Association of Specialisht Anglers member put in a couple of days on the River Swale at Topcliffe in North Yorkshire to take six chub over 4 lb ,  including specimens of 5 lb 13 oz and 5 lb 12 oz. The river had been ten feet up the previous week and I thing the chub had been pushed into the swim ,  said Mick ,  33 .  But it also meant a lot of brances had been <head>washed</head> down and the river has a lot of snags anyway . The line just went solid with the 5 ob 13 oz fish see - sawing around a snag and I was sure the line would go .  A similar thing happened with the 5 lb 12 oz fish but I had luck on my side .

That young girl hardly out of her teens ,  married to an ailing elderly man ,  probably never went out of the house apart from these visits to the hospital .  Being well - off  ( the wife of a restaurant owner )  ,  she had many beautiful saris .  Wearing a different one every time she went out would be only normal , particularly since a sari does not have to be <head>washed</head> as frequently as a dress because it is not worn next to the skin . To get a more general view of how the Health Service departments treat their Asian women patients ,  I asked social workers in different parts of London what their experiences had been in dealing with hospitals ,  Health Visitors and Area Health Authorities .  They told me that there were serious everyday problems which arose because the needs of Asian patients were being ignored .

The Ferguson - developed 4wd system ,  which directs power between the front and rear wheels in a fixed 34/66 per cent ratio ,  is effective and durable but hardly state of the art .  Scouring the dealers in a still slushy Scotland ,  I came across a 1985 B - plate model on offer for 4995 at Alex Ritchie Motors of 43 Nithsdale Street  south of the Clyde in real Taggart country .  The car had been <head>washed</head> but not valeted and its general condition suggested that the 58,160 mileage was genuine something that the decidedly patchy service history was unable to confirm ( the vehicle arrived at Ritchie Motors without a service book ) . No sign of any crash repair damage was evident in the bodywork ,  panel alignment was good and the diamond white paintwork looked blemish - free until closer inspection revealed the truth .  Sales director Sandy Ritchie pointed out the repainted sills ,  which were peppered and chipped when the car was acquired .

It was prettily furnished by Diana and ,  although the hallway was a jumble of bicycles and tennis racquets ,  the rest of the flat was remarkably clean and neat .  Diana could never go to bed and leave a mess behind , however late ; she would always tidy up and <head>wash</head> any dirty dishes . Diana and her friends were a clean - living set  none of them smoked or drank much  and when they went out ,  it tended to be in a group .  They would go to one another 's  flats ,  have supper in a bistro ,  go to a film ,  or sit at home with bowls of spaghetti ,  chatting and watching television .
