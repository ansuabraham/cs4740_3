Surprisingly ,  this is true of both the classical and modern play ,  though you might expect that the obscurities and difficulties of words and expression would prove more of a stumbling block in ,  say ,  Shakespeare or Ben Jonson .  Here is a suggested first reading list ,  which I 've put together to provide a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's  development .  There is a danger in reading the classics , in that they can come to be regarded simply as literature so always try to look at them as plays for <head>performance</head> and , it goes without saying , try to see as much theatre as you can . It 's  worthwhile reading some pre - Shakespearean drama ;  you could read Everyman  ,  a great morality play of the late Middle Ages ,  and Gammer Gurton 's  Needle  ,  first performed in 1566 and thought to be the second oldest English comedy .  You should try to read as much as you can of the great Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists ;  Shakespeare ,  Marlowe and Ben Jonson ,  Beaumont and Fletcher ,  Tourneur ,  Webster ,  Middleton .

And remember there is no need to be afraid of Hamlet .  He is ,  after all ,  an actor 's  part and perfectly accessible  he prefers ,  too ,  to be acted rather than to be read .  Years of scholarship and so many contentious <head>performances</head> mean that the character is now regarded as difficult , when it can in fact benefit from the freshness and vitality of the natural actor , who will quickly find the comic qualities of the man as well as his serious side . Ophelia is often ignored for audition material simply because she does n't seem to have much in the way of a sustained speech until she goes mad .  Yet her earlier speech ,  where she describes Hamlet 's  condition and behaviour ,  has great tenderness and awareness :

Remember this when the pace hots up !  Students usually find that the first term 's  work is relatively gentle .  At nearly all schools no stage <head>performances</head> will be seen by an audience until at least the end of the second term . Sometimes students get anxious about this ,  and believe they are not making audience contact early enough ;  but if you think about it ,  the reasoning is clear .  Most of your technical tutors will be seeing everything you do ,  and deriving what they need to know from it ;  they do n't want to find you confused by criticism from senior students which might not be helpful to you at this point .

Students may find themselves performing in final productions over two full terms ,  which means they have the opportunity to play twice as many parts ,  but this depends on the school 's  policy and how they think you have progressed .  At this stage ,  too ,  the allocation of parts and the standard of performance is becoming a lot more competitive  a foretaste of the profession itself .  In many cases students will also tour in productions mounted by the school , and this gives good audience experience away from the greenhouse of school <head>performances</head> , where the people who sit in the audience are usually either professionally interested , or are fellow students and friends . Any programme of final drama school productions will present a variety of styles and the casting is aimed at giving students a chance to do well in suitable roles .  Naturally ,  with a cast of actors who are all approximately the same age ,  the casting of heavy character parts has to be considered very carefully ,  and of course not all plays are teeming with characters of similar age .

They are personal work - out sessions .  Altogether ,  tutorials take place over a period of about twenty - four weeks in the last year of a course ,  and usually by the last twelve tutorials a student has a much clearer idea of what he or she is about .  Where the tutorial focuses on current productions , I have found that students will work hard on their <head>performances</head> and be open about their work and any problems they may be having with the characters they are playing . A director may have made it plain that he has a definite intention for a character ,  but the student may not always see this straight away .  Discussing a character and finding an outline of what is required in a half hour tutorial can save a lot or time on a tight rehearsal schedule .

He concluded the bill was a legislator 's  attempt to assume institutions work on the kind of rational and ordered basis which they outwardly pretend .  In this he recognizes the same problem which faces the insider/ethnographer ,  for he clearly understands that pretence ,  deception ,  and bizarre social drama play a large part in police culture and accepts this will be difficult to research .  However , he is optimistic ( as any professional researcher must remain ! ) , for he cites Sir Kenneth Newman 's efforts as the new commissioner of the Metropolitan Police to make police ethics a major issue , so that <head>performance</head> assessment , promotion criteria etc. , will take integrity and professional conduct more and more into account . With hindsight it seems that the prevailing structures of police practice will remain as powerful as ever ,  for at a conference on policing at Bristol University  ( 1988 )  ,  the newly retired Sir Kenneth admitted that police culture had defeated many of his attempts to bring a new ethic to the managerial style during his reign as commissioner of the metropolis .

In effect we were becoming structurally and visibly undisciplined ,  in a world where discipline has its import spelled out  on every occasion .

His early involvement in this so - called jazz - poetry  which achieved such popularity in the sixties  shows that Leonard ,  not for the first time ,  and certainly not the last ,  was where it was all happening before it actually happened .

Before passing on I want to raise a problem with all this .  It may have occurred to some readers already .  Isn't there something suspicious about making the <head>performance</head> of intentional actions the acid test of objective knowledge when it is quite possible that young babies have a very rich knowledge about the unseen existence of objects but that they lack the capacity to co - ordinate this knowledge with their motor skills at object removal ? Constructivism seems to make this a logical impossibility ,  which of course means that no data could ever disprove the constructivist claims about what develops in  infancy :  any evidence that object knowledge  ( the object concept or object permanence )  exists without reaching behaviour will not be judged to be evidence for object permanence  as a point of logic .  I will say two things about this issue .

This is one of the reasons why Chomsky  ( 1959 )  was able to launch such a devastating attack on radical behaviourism .  The inadequacy of conceptualizing stimuli in purely physical terms is neatly illustrated in a study by Campbell ,  Landis and Regard  ( 1986 )  .  They compared the <head>performance</head> of two patients on a lip - reading task and on a task which required analysis of facial expression . One of the patients could not categorize the expression on faces that she was shown in photographs in terms of whether the expression was one of happiness ,  anger ,  surprise and so on .  However ,  she was  able to judge the sounds that were being mouthed by faces in photographs ,  and showed other evidence of normal lip - reading abilities .

When he is shown a pair of faces and has to decide which of the two is a celebrity ,  he performs at chance level ,  even though he performs almost as well as normal subjects on this task when the faces are replaced by their names .  In other situations ,  however ,  PH 's  pattern of responding makes it clear that he is recognizing familiar faces at an unconscious level .  The clearest example of this is PH 's <head>performance</head> in priming tasks ( Young , Hellawell and De Haan , 1988 ) . Associative priming is a well known phenomenon in cognitive psychology .  If one has to identify a stimulus  for instance a word  -  then one can accomplish this more quickly if presentation of the word is immediately preceded by an associated word or picture .

One theory is there should be Sydney ,  a week earlier than at present ,  leading into the Australian Open ,  the Stella Artois Championships as the traditional prelude to Wimbledon ,  plus Cincinnati and Indianapolis on the way into the U.S. Open .  Rather more controversial would be deciding which tournament should take pride of place in the European clay court season leading into Paris .  Tradition suggests Rome , especially now that it is once more a major tournament in every way , despite suffering from so many lack lustre <head>performances</head> from some of the leading players this year . Somehow ,  I cannot see either Monte Carlo or Hamburg allowing their status to be lowered without a fight .  Also in an ideal calendar ,  the Grand Slam Cup should be brought forward to the end of October ,  45 weeks after the US Open ,  which would not only give the players a brief chance to relax but then to prepare for the tour finale on an indoor surface .

While much was achieved in improving safety standards ,  towards the decade 's  end there was a series of accidents that perhaps shocked the public more than anything since Harrow  Wealdstone in the very early days of nationalisation .  And while the eighties saw fewer closures and many more reopenings than anyone could reasonably have hoped ,  it ended with thunder clouds of uncertainty about management style ,  privatisation ,  how to solve overcrowding ,  the Channel Tunnel .  Then there was the paradox that the erstwhile Premier Line out of Euston steadily slipped down the speed and <head>performance</head> league as the High Speed Trains out of King 's Cross , St Pancras and Paddington proved ( for all the undoubted technical troubles ) that they could sustain their role as InterCity 's workaday tool .

Sir Neville Cardus ,  another great music critic writing about the history of music ,  likened the image of great composers such as Bach ,  Mozart and Beethoven as ,  Looking at a range of mountains ,  those names are on the summits then one comes to a plateau  and there standing out and rising from it is the cathedral of Csar Franck .  This statement exactly sums up the quality and feeling of Franck 's  music .  As organist and piano teacher most of it was composed for <head>performance</head> at some ritual , often in church it conveys not only the solemnity of the occasion but also the spaciousness of the building and the sound of the organ with its vast range of tonalities . It is without emotion but conveys a sense of reverence for order and serenity .

Once the basic structure fur a story ballet has been created ,  the choreographer must find ways of linking the beginning ,  climax and end so that the plot develops easily from one scene to the next .  This can be effected by the use of a leitmotif or phrases of music .  Since the first <head>performance</head> of Giselle , certain composers and arrangers have used leitmotifs fur one or several characters and repeat the leitmotifs each time the characters appear . These musical phrases give continuity to the action and are most valuable because they help both performers and audience to understand how moments in the story or theme affect the players .  Adolphe Adam ,  composer of the music for Giselle  ,  initiated this idea which greatly influenced Wagner and later composers .

The whole <head>performance</head> is based on the classical vocabulary of steps shorn of every convention so that he can go swifter than an arrow from an archer 's bow .

Choreographers should therefore note that it is possible to design movements which may contradict the music that is being played ,  but not if they contradict the mood and rhythmic qualities of the whole context .

Details of the improved mosfet were revealed at a recent VLSI technology symposium in Japan .  The mosfet is less than 1m wide and operates at liquid nitrogen temperatures  (  - 196C )  .  Improved <head>performance</head> is obtained through building an ultra - thin channel of silicon - germanium alloy under the silicon surface of the mosfet to restrain mobility of the charges carrying current through the device . The germanium layer confines the charges just under the skin ,  preventing them from bumping into the surface and scattering from their designated path through the transistor .  Researchers built the channel so that it is free of dopants ,  stopping the charges from bumping into impurity atoms along the way .

Those on the input will be similar to what the standard Buck topology requires ;  those on the output ( s )  could be made smaller ,  though the reduction is limited by the need to keep enough capacitance  to absorb fast load transients .  To summarise ,  the Cuk converter has an apparent advantage over standard Buck topology in that it uses an integrated magnetic structure and can reduce input and output ripple currents to very low levels .  On the other hand , the required energy coupling capacitors cause problems and can be expensive at higher current levels , and there does not seem to be any proof that there is a volume , weight , or cost saving over the standard Buck topology for any given equivalent <head>performance</head> level . All credit is due to Terrence Finnegan for his two recent articles which ,  for the first time ,  have made available useful and usable designinformation .  Nevertheless the Cuk converter topology seems likely to remain an outsider until a true trade - off comparison can be made between Cuk and Buck at a series of realistic equivalent performance levels ,  a task that would take a lot of time ,  but whose results would be of great interest to many in the power supply design field .

Digital signal processing  ( DSP )  is generally regarded as one of the fastest expanding areas of electronics .  Advent of low cost processors allowing DSP algorithms to be implemented with relative ease means electronics engineers now have much greater awareness of its potential  certainly not the case five years ago. Continuing commitment and investment by IC manufactures in developing high <head>performance</head> DSP chips points to a very promising future for DSP . The four front runners with the highest market profiles are Texas Instruments  ( with its ever expanding TMS320 series )  ,  Motorola  ( DSP56000 and DSP96002 )  ,  Analog Devices  ( the versatile family of ADSP - 210x devices )  and ATT  ( the long standing DSP32C among others )  .  Several second row contenders such as Zoran ,  Thomson and Philips are struggling to capture a sizeable foot hole in the market .

Issued by Rich Software and distributed by Bores Signal Processing it contains a number of library functions which allow the DSP32 ( C )  to access the bios of the hose PC .  If a user has an expansion card featuring the DSP32 ( C )  ,  then source code can contain the usual graphics and normal input/output instructions found in Microsoft C. As a result C language programs can be run on the DSP32 ( C ) instead of the PC 's CPU , giving a quite remarkable increase in <head>performance</head> . A Pascal compiler is also available .

Most assemblers have facilities for creating macros and library functions and have the appropriate facility to allow parameter passing .  To accompany the cross assembler a linker will perform the usual task of allocating addresses to the assembled code modules and attaching the run - time libraries to generate an executable program .  When programming in assembler , the role of the simulator , copying operation of the DSP chip , can be quite invaluable especially if testing <head>performance</head> of numerical operations . Simulators have come a long way in recent years and today many of them use screen addressing to update the information .  An example is the Avocet Avsim321 TM32010 simulator  a good product as it gives instant visual access to all registers of the processor so users can monitor progress of the program ,  line by line if required .

In this case ,  the expansion card hosting the target processor comes to the fore .  Success of the PC as an engineering tool must in part be due to its expansion bus and the fact that nearly every type of facility can be found on a PC card .  Cards are by far the most effective means of investigating <head>performance</head> of a DSP device . But the user must be patient when learning the ins and outs of an expansion card .  Information in the user manual is almost always inadequate leaving new users to find out for themselves how it works  although this does enhance practical knowledge of the processor .

Twenty years on ,  the phrases which she saw as indicating a deformation of values have become commonplace in the Thatcherite academy ,  where contemplation is regarded as idleness ,  rather than the other way round ,  and Leavis 's  abominated technologico - Benthamism is firmly in the saddle .

I think it true to say that at the present time it is not at all difficult for academics to appear in print .

( In the pursuit of <head>performance</head> - indicators , publication in refereed journals counts for much , though I am not sure if I have ever appeared in a refereed journal in my life . ) However ,  new academic journals are regularly launched ,  devoted to one or other of the many specialisms into which English is fragmenting ,  and in their earlier issues ,  at least ,  are likely to be looking for contributions .  It is ,  however ,  in the vastly expanded world of academic book publishing that the greatest opportunities lie .

Arriving in Cyprus ahead of Othello ,  an understandably nervous Desdemona is forced to hang around on the quay and ,  in an effortful charade of lightheartedness ,  swap bawdy banter with Iago and company .  In Nunn 's  way of orchestrating the scene ,  however ,  the forced merriment comes across like the willed time - killing in Three Sisters ,  less the whiling away of a few specific minutes than the attempt to shake off a pervasive ennui .  Never less than thoroughly fascinating , the production is dominated by Ian McKellen 's extraordinary Iago , a <head>performance</head> which feels like a shifting palimpsest of impersonations . Partly ,  with his flat Northern vowels ,  tight blue uniform and fusspot bracings and flexings ,  he is the officious British bobby of the Derek Guyler school .  But in the discreet ,  epicene efficiency with which he clears away Casio 's  bowl of vomit or dusts down Othello after his fit ,  he is the finicky gentleman 's  gentleman ,  his body language strongly reminiscent of Dirk Bogarde in The Servant .

The nearest you get to this is the thrilling moment at the end of Act One when ,  as though he had engendered them ,  the thunder and lightning which usher in the next act and a complete change of country ,  melodramatically erupt during Iago 's  concluding lines .  Elsewhere ,  the close - up ,  detailed approach which works brilliantly ,  say ,  for Imogen Stubbs 's  affecting Desdemona  ( the pathos of her disoriented ,  jittery jauntiness intensified by beautiful touches such as the sepia photograph of her estranged father she keeps on the bedside table in Cyprus or the chocolates from Casio that she has secreted in a locked draw ,  not because she fears sexual misconstruction but because she would like to be thought too grown - up for frivolous sweet - guzzling by Othello )  paradoxically diminishes Iago because it encourages the belief that he can be realistically explained like a figure in a novel .  With Willard White 's massive , resonantly spoken ( if rhythmically uncertain ) Moor , the slight mismatch of scale between the size of <head>performance</head> and the chamber - dimension of the production is all to the good . Othello is larger - than - life and never more so than when determined to die ,  as White demonstrates in a nobly paced resumption of dignity in the difficult final scene .  But ,  with Iago ,  Nunn has opted for a congruence of scales .

Then somebody let the livestock loose .  If Les Negresses Vertes tend to jostle on the stage like animals being herded down a narrow street ,  it is partly because there are so many of them  ( 11 ,  when all the strays are rounded up )  ,  but also because ,  even as the show begins ,  several key members appear to be too drunk to be capable of motion in a straight line .  This might sound like irresponsibility , but , given how the <head>performance</head> pans out , you could also read it as professional commitment ; the longer the show goes on , the more the drink goes down and , in a remarkable contradiction of physics , the tighter the playing becomes . In fact ,  midway through the first song ,  only the size of the band dissuaded you from buying a round to speed up the process .  You only had to compare the opening version of Zobi la Mouche  ( lumpy drums and shuddering halts )  with the neatly turned performance eventually wheeled out as an encore ,  to realise how this is a machine which runs the better for being well - oiled .

The humour inheres not just in the daffy selection of cultural allusions  ( their native French accordion ,  some flamenco guitar ,  a few African horns )  but also in the way they take stiff ,  formal tempi  ( waltzes and tangos )  and mockingly squeeze them for their stateliness .  It also comes naturally to them to include any musical form with a sharp sense of its own absurdity ;  ska ,  for instance  ( there are touches of Madness here )  or a hyperactive brand of rhythm and blues  ( they become almost a French Blues Brothers on Marcelle Ratafia )  .

Commons sources confirmed that on Thursday Mrs Thatcher stood at the despatch box with a television monitor nearby to see how she appeared on television in the chamber .  Her advisers are expected to groom her in adapting her Commons <head>performances</head> at Prime Minister 's question time to television coverage . The same day ministerial aides met to co - ordinate the attack on Labour .  One source said :  Our blood is up.

The minister also said that there would be no financial or budgetary disadvantage whatsoever to any GP who had to treat a large number of chronically ill patients .  Mr Mellor dismissed the suggestion that self - governing hospitals would focus on acute specialities ,  to the detriment of the chronically ill .  District health authorities will be under a duty to ensure that demands for both acute and community health care are adequately met , and their <head>performance</head> in discharging this vital function will be monitored .

They awarded me a seat behind a pillar for this French farce ,  but foolishly I moved to a place where I had a full view of the stage .  I say foolishly because  ( it )  grows worse the more you see of it Miss Phillips 's <head>performance</head> is really a series of inappropriate costumes by Pierre Balmain and the actress wafts around in a lilac voile morning trouser suit , a black cocktail number , dresses up to resemble a wasp and dresses down in a riot of patchwork heliotrope , orange , purple , blue and green . It is as if her costumes were the reasons for her being there .  Perhaps they were .

THOSE who care about such things are at present locked in combat over the issue of whether the greatest number of British skiers go to Austria  ( which traditionally enjoys the distinction )  or to France  ( which is the flavour of the decade )  .  Both ,  according to the latest figures conjured out of a hat by the French ,  have just over 35 per cent of the market .  Of much more interest to Alp - watchers is the <head>performance</head> of the other great Alpine skiing nations . The French reckon that Italy now gets 7 per cent of our custom and ,  more surprisingly ,  that Switzerland gets only 5 per cent .  Once upon a time ,  this might have been 95 per cent .

But she effortlessly avoided that exasperating coyness with which some seek to engage their audience ,  and the group also included the angelic Wir haben beide lange Zeit with whose chiming repetitions she wove an enchanting spell .  To frame this more familiar fare ,  she presented songs by Enesco and Marx ,  bringing to them the skill of a dramatic singer without ever overstepping the bounds of intimate communion required by the genre .  Enesco is a major force in twentieth century music whose almost total neglect at present is quite astonishing , and if his little Poemes de Clement Marot show a limited aspect of his art , they still breathed an engaging wit and charm in Miss Cotrubas 's heart - warming <head>performance</head> . No less devotion was brought to four songs by Joseph Marx ,  and although the rather overheated style of Nocturne elicited a few smiles  ( Parsons performing prodigies in representing the burgeoning June night )  there was a touching ecstasy in Hat dich die Liebe beruhrt which was delivered absolutely from the heart .  It could perhaps be said that Miss Cotrubas came truly into her own with the operatic excerpts that provided the second half of her programme .

As a star ,  Bette Davis was of the type commonly designated inimitable ,  which tends to mean  ( as it did in her case )  that she eventually became the butt of countless imitators ;  and these imitators merely accentuated symptoms of self - parody that were already detectable in her own screen presence .  Though she was a performer of indisputable talent ,  one was none the less left with a nagging impression that overarching each of her individual characteristics was another role ,  one she played to the hilt :  that of the grande dame ,  the First Lady of the American cinema ,  the Duse of the double - feature .  At her worst which is to say , when her <head>performances</head> , all crust and no bread , seemed little more than a rash of mannerisms she could strike one as impossibly tic - ridden and implausible . At her considerable best  when her physical angularity ,  her fluttery ,  melodramatic flounces and her inclination to treat the most unpretentious line of dialogue as a conversation - stopper were tempered either by a real affinity with the role in question or else by a witty ,  self - deprecating sense of her own absurdity in it  she remained one of the most consistently spell - binding of Hollywood stars .  Before the phrase became fashionable ,  Davis was ,  on - screen ,  the epitome of the castrating female ,  her appeal as a cinematic icon being thus largely confined to the feminine  ( and ,  by a probably logical extension ,  homosexual )  portion of her audience .

In a speech announcing his decisions ,  he said he wanted a wider debate on some points .  He also suggested that school governors with commercial or industrial experience might be particularly interested in introducing appraisal schemes .  In a letter to members , the Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association warns against schemes with no guarantee of adequate resources ; which may blur the process of professional development with the identification of alleged weaknesses for disciplinary purposes ; and which may be used as a crude and inequitable process for relating salary rates to arbitrarily judged levels of <head>performance</head> . The National Union of Teachers says that all school appraisal schemes  -  including existing ones  should be boycotted and local authority schemes supported only if they follow all the recommendations of the steering group .  Making all children learn a foreign language will do nothing to help Britain commercially ,  Sir Alfred Sherman ,  a former adviser to the Prime Minister ,  says today .

The transputer contains a processor ,  memory ,  and communications links on a single chip ,  which makes it an ideal building block for multi - processor computers .  More importantly ,  the transputer allows modular supercomputers to be built .  When users want to improve the <head>performance</head> of their machine , they do not have to throw it away and buy a newer model . Instead ,  they can buy more processors and add them to the existing machine .  The success of this approach can be judged by Meiko 's  growth .

What this power has meant to the scientific and industrial users involved in the ECSP was made apparent during the project 's  second annual seminar last month .  Applications ranging from molecular sequencing  ( an important tool in bio - engineering )  to modelling oil reservoirs ,  image processing and high - energy physics were described .  Modern science is critically dependent on high - <head>performance</head> computing ; studies of the world 's changing climate , structural engineering , and medical imaging simply could not have progressed to their present state without access to the sort of computing power that can only be provided by parallel machines . Much funding for the ECSP has been raised from industry .  Major industrial partners ,  like Shell ,  Hewlett - Packard ,  and Meiko itself have contributed both money and equipment to help the project to the point where it can offer a reliable multi - user service to people from all over the UK .

Hockey :  Taylor a pillar between posts By BILL COLWILL England 0 Australia . . 0 STEVE TAYLOR probably established himself as the rightful successor to his more famous namesake , Ian , when he gave an outstanding <head>performance</head> of goalkeeping in England 's final game in the Lada Classic at Luton yesterday - a goalless draw with the world champions . The result was enough ,  however ,  to give Australia the trophy .  Following their disappointing performance against the Dutch on Saturday when they lost 5 - 1 ,  England made a number of changes ,  including dropping captain Richard Leman and introducing a young right - wing triangle of Chris Mayer ,  Russell Garcia and Rob Hill .
