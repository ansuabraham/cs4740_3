I bet none of them are showing anything as daft as this ,  I mused to myself .  The shelter that Jenny had found for me was in Camden Town ,  not too far away ,  so in order not to arrive there before it got going for the evening ,  I dawdled a little ,  window - shopping .  Up on Tottenham Court Road there were all the gadget shops , all displaying their various ranges of radios , record players , compact - <head>disc</head> players and videos all of which seemed to be housed in bewilderingly similar sleek black boxes . All is conformity now ,  I thought to myself .  All is conformity .

Lee used nothing but this <head>disc</head> to carve the piece with an angle grinder , and he describes some of the effects the tool can achieve .

On the fruitwood I was working it left an interesting rippled effect .  However the moment it slips you have to wait for the chain to gain momentum before cutting can recommence ,  otherwise it bites again .  Waiting is a bore , and it is worth noting that the chain continues to rotate after the <head>disc</head> has stopped , so beware fingers . In all ,  this seems a product created more by necessity than design .  I believe that the original Arbortech Woodcarver was one of the most dynamic inventions for woodworkers of recent time ,  offering fast cutting with a good finish and potential for fine detailing .

Mosaics are just tiny tiles  usually plain in colour ,  sometimes with a pattern  which are sold made up in sheets on a tough fabric backing .  They are laid just like tiles ,  in a bed of adhesive ,  and the gaps are grouted afterwards .  Square mosaics are the most common , but <head>discs</head> , hexagons and other interlocking shapes are also available . Sheets are usually 300mm  ( 12in )  square ,  and are often sold in packs of five or 10 ;  the best way of estimating quantities is to work out the area to be covered ,  and to divide that by the coverage figure given on the pack ,  which will tell you how many packs to buy .  Note that wall and floor types are of different thicknesses ,  just like ordinary ceramic tiles .

Based on the smallest of the commonly available disc sizes ,  the 100mm  ( 4in )  ,  the machine is almost identical to its larger brother ,  the FG12SA .  Setting up the tool requires only the two spanners provided as standard accessories .  One holds the spindle steady whilst the other fits into the twin holes on the wheel nut and tightens the <head>disc</head> in place . Also provided with the grinder is a disc for use on metalwork .  Finally ,  a screw - in side handle is fixed on to the alloy gear cover ,  offset either to the left or right depending on the user .

Hitachi have also taken the trouble to make the control large enough to operate when wearing thick gloves .  Grinders should be held at a shallow angle of between 15 and 30 to the work when they are used to abrade the surface .  This offers the maximum amount of <head>disc</head> edge to the work and does not overload the motor . When in use ,  the semi - circular wheel guard of the Hitachi deflects sparks ,  chippings etc away from the operator .  Two screws hold the guard in the optimum position ,  the open sides pointing directly away from the body of the machine .

For objects which need some thickness of metal ,  like ingots or axes ,  casting is the obvious method ,  while others ,  like fine wire or thin sheet metal ,  need extensive working .

For example , a bowl may be formed by casting , by hammering up the sides from a fiat <head>disc</head> , or by a combination of casting ( for the basic dish shape ) and working up details , like the rim . In rare instances ,  there is still evidence of manufacturing methods ,  for example the clay moulds used for casting bronze bridle bits and other equestrian equipment found at the Iron Age site of Gussage All Saints or stone moulds for weapons  ( fig. 5.7 )  .  Other clues to the manufacturing process might be found by examining the object itself .

Philips ,  the Dutch electronics company which invented the CD ,  long ago dropped its original advertising slogan :  Perfect sounds forever .  A spokesman said yesterday that the company promised a lifetime 's  use if the CDs were manufactured correctly .

The main problem is that the stored sound can be lost when the thin layer of aluminium which coats a CD 's  plastic surface is oxidised ,  losing its ability to reflect laser light .  European CD manufacturers have begun a regular exchange of information on quality to help improve the discs '  longevity and hope to agree on an international standard testing procedure involving exposure of the discs to heat and humidity .

A favourite composer of Beecham 's  was Berlioz ,  so it 's  good to have back in circulation his famous 1957 performance of the Symphonie Fantastique with the French National Radio Orchestra  ( CDM7 64032 2 )  coupled with the overtures King Lear ,  made with the RPO ,  and the pre - War and still vivid Carnival Romain with the LPO ;  even if the recording of the last is a bit confined .  All show the conductor 's  empathy with the composer displayed in lyrical lines and incandescent climaxes ,  poetry and fire nicely balanced .

Completing this issue are vivid accounts of other Beecham favourites ,  Franck 's  D minor Symphony and Lalo 's  in G minor  ( CDM7 63396 2 )  ,  both with the French National Radio Orchestra ,  and a disc of lollipops  ( CDM7 63412 2 )  with the RPO .  These are all stereo originals and sound as fresh as the day they were made .  EMI 's Great Recordings of the Century features two <head>discs</head> of British music conducted by Beecham 's near - contemporary , Sir John Barbirolli . With his beloved Halle and its attendant choir he performs John Ireland 's  These Things Shall Be and ,  with the orchestra alone ,  Bax 's  Third Symphony  ( CDH7 63910 )  ,  music that does n't deserve the neglect into which it has fallen since these 1940s performances .  Even better are his accounts of Vaughan Williams 's  London and Eighth Symphonies from the 1950s  ( CDM7 641972 )  .

Yet none of these works can rival ,  for sheer novelty and strangeness ,  Sibelius 's  Sixth Symphony ,  still one of the most mystifying and mesmerising orchestral utterances of the century .  Its vacillations of mood ,  from white - hot passion concealed behind a frosty stare to an almost insouciant dance - like gaiety ,  are beautifully captured in a generally distinguished performance by the Danish Radio orchestra under Leif Segerstam .  The <head>disc</head> is filled out with the tone - poems Pohjola 's Daughter and En Saga , the latter ( I always think ) just five minutes too long . Abbado 's  latest disc as Karajan 's  Berlin successor is devoted to Brahms :  cogent and altogether admirable performances of the Fourth Symphony and Haydn Variations to join the many others of which the same could be said .  What makes this disc worth having is the setting for chorus and orchestra of Schiller 's  Nanie ,  composed in memory of a friend .

The starfish are among the most important of invertebrate predators living today .  They make major depredations on oyster beds and the recent activities of the Crown of Thorns starfish  (  Acanthaster  )  in chewing up great chunks of the Great Barrier Reef have become a modern ecological object lesson  ( and ,  incidentally ,  a source of funds for many marine biologists )  .

Ophiuroids are especially abundant in deep sea environments ,  and it is unusual for a deep sea dredge to miss one of these small animals .

The next milestone was the idea of mass - producing copies of recordings .  This involved making a negative version of the recording ,  with ridges instead of grooves ,  so the copies could be formed from that .  The <head>disc</head> records invented by Berliner were the first to possess this advantage , since they could be stamped out almost like printing . They also permitted a much simpler reproducing machine ,  since the groove itself propelled the soundbox ,  no additional screw mechanism being necessary  ( 7 )  .  At first ,  the playing time for both discs and cylinders was the same  about two minutes  but the fact that discs could be made in different sizes ,  all of which could be played on the same machine ,  was another advantage .

At first ,  the playing time for both discs and cylinders was the same  about two minutes  but the fact that discs could be made in different sizes ,  all of which could be played on the same machine ,  was another advantage .  In 1901 it was found that a ten - inch disc  ( playing for three minutes )  was better for most types of music ,  even popular songs ,  and the popular single was born .  Although cylinder manufacturers countered effectively for some decades , first with moulding techniques and later with finer grooves , the overwhelming simplicity of being able to press thousands of copies of <head>disc</head> records and play them on a simple machine eventually told in the disc 's favour . Certainly it became economic to pay recording artists large fees ;  and without mass - production ,  few recordings of top   artists would survive in playable form today .    7 A Berliner Gramophone .

It was difficult enough to cut a perfect master 78rpm <head>disc</head> with a duration of only five minutes . To cut a perfect long - playing side without stopping imposed intolerable demands on everyone .

These were played by a beam of laser light rather than a stylus ,  and Philips saw that combining digital audio with laser disc technology would be a great improvement upon the Dolby Cassette and the LP .

The next day Walter Miller of the Edison Company was asked whether all the musical records he sent would have the title on the end of the cylinder ,  as they had seen arranged at the laboratory the day before ,  to which he replied ,  Yes sir ,  they will be fixed up that way .  However ,  it was not to be ;  the Edison company preferred to market the phonograph as a dictation machine ,  and nearly a decade went by before cylinder moulding became a commercial reality .  In the meantime , Berliner 's first <head>disc</head> records were made in Germany , and these definitely had labels of a sort ( 25 , 26 ) . The only doubt concerns the date ;  it seems these early records could be from any year between 1889 and 1891 ,  so whether Edison or Berliner was actually first to make records with a label is open to debate .  The conventional paper label was never possible on a cylinder ,  since there was insufficient flat space .

This was enforced by a system of adhesive stamps ,  the value of which was calculated to provide a royalty of five per cent of the retail cost of the record  ( see 31c )  .

It was normal practice for the trademark to occupy the upper half of the design ,  while the title and other details occupied the lower half .  The exceptions are sufficiently rare to be worth a study on their own ;   it was quite a challenge for designers to make effective use of a relatively small circular area with a hole in the middle .  The challenge became even greater with the advent of 45rpm <head>discs</head> , which had to be provided with an optional centre no less than an inch and a half in diameter for quick - acting autochange and juke - box mechanisms . Designers therefore could not use the middle of the label to carry vital information .

The idea was to sit the listener in the middle of a square array of loudspeakers ,  so sound would come at him from all corners  despite the fact that most live performances of music take place in front of the listener .  Most consumers had bought stereo equipment by then ,  and equipment manufacturers saw quadraphony as a golden opportunity to cash in on sales of new records ,  pickups ,  amplifiers ,  and loudspeakers .  Much effort was expended in squeezing four channels of sound onto an LP <head>disc</head> , and there were four incompatible systems , none of which worked very well . There seemed to be two areas of subject - matter where quadraphonics might have an artistic advantage ,  drama and wildlife recording ,  so it seemed very sensible when the first quadraphonic record of birdsong was announced .  However ,  it was not possible to get any quadraphonic effect from the record ,  no matter which system was tried .

Three factors  ( size ,  speed ,  and groove - pitch )  might be manipulated to make long - playing records .

Probably the first long - playing <head>disc</head> records were made by the Neophone Company of London in 1904 ; they were twenty inches in diameter . The recordings comprised uninterrupted performances of opera overtures ,  but they cost ten shillings and sixpence each ,  and needed an outsize turntable .

50 A twenty - inch Path disc .  This example plays for 3 minutes 10 seconds and weighs 2.2 kilograms .  Another long - playing <head>disc</head> was the World Record , invented in 1922 by Noel Pemberton - Billing . The principle was as follows .  At the outside edge of a twelve - inch 78rpm record ,  the groove travels under the stylus at about 47 inches per second .

At the outside edge of a twelve - inch 78rpm record ,  the groove travels under the stylus at about 47 inches per second .  At the end of the record ,  when the stylus is approaching the label ,  the groove is travelling at about twenty inches per second ,  yet the sound quality is very similar .  Why not make the groove move at twenty inches per second throughout the whole <head>disc</head> ? This means starting the record at about 33rpm ,  and speeding it up gradually as the stylus travels in .  Pemberton - Billing 's  invention comprised an add - on governor mechanism which could be attached to a clockwork turntable to give this  effect  ( 49 )  ,  and a few dozen records were made which more than doubled the average playing - time .

Alternatively ,  we could use an electronically - controlled variable - speed turntable ,  but we have no absolute way of knowing what the correct speed is .  Fortunately World Records seem to have few important recordings on them .  I wonder if Pemberton - Billing would be pleased if he could know that modern Laservision discs and Compact Digital <head>Discs</head> work on a similar principle , although starting in the middle and slowing down. On the new discs the material is recorded in batches called frames ,  and electronic circuitry counts the reproduced frames and controls the speed that way .   51 Doll 's  House Disc .

52 Gramophone with Auxetophone attachment .  This model has a hand - pump for the amplifier .  Since the turntable had a clockwork winding mechanism and the air - pump demanded continuous cranking while the <head>disc</head> played , you had to be fit to play a record ! The Auxetophone also permitted the first disc - copying to take place .  It was impossible to transfer sound waves mechanically from one flat disc to another without getting into geometrical difficulties ,  and an ordinary gramophone was not loud enough to be put in front of an acoustic recording horn .

A relatively thin piece of cardboard  more like thick paper ,  really  was coated on one side with a material called Durium .  Because it was single - sided ,   the groove pitch was doubled to allow two numbers on each disc .  The same company also made a French language course and many advertising mini - <head>discs</head> . Despite their apparent fragility ,  there are lots of examples surviving today ,  and collectors were genuinely sorry when the series came to a halt after only forty - two weeks .  Durium records probably came nearest to making sound recordings really accessible to the masses ,  forming a gramophonic equivalent of the paper - backed book .

As we saw earlier ,  discs permitted simple and cheap record - players ;  but the advantage was lost if the record - players had to have sapphire or diamond points made out of precious gems .  So steel needles were often used instead .  To make the needle fit the groove , the <head>disc</head> contained abrasive material , so the tip would be ground down during the first two or three revolutions . This system remained until polyvinyl chloride records began to appear .  Vinyl was much more expensive .

After the war ,  unfilled vinyl was used because it had much less surface noise ,  and a few sets of unfilled vinyl 78s were made for early hi - fi buffs .  But it was not until the development of the LP that the cost could be absorbed for the everyday consumer ,  because an LP could hold five times as much material .  The shellac record disappeared about 1960 , and nowadays all <head>disc</head> records are unbreakable by comparison . One cannot help wondering what future generations will think of our freaks and follies .  As this book was going to press ,  an anonymous correspondent of The Weekend Telegraph  wrote concerning the pop group House Of Love ,  whose single Shine On had been re - recorded .

The main symptom is short - term memory loss ,  which includes repetition of statements and actions .  In fact it 's  not that the memory is lost ,  so much as the person ca n't get out the facts which are stored in the memory .  It 's rather like a computer when the <head>disc</head> goes wrong you know the info is there but you ca n't tap into it . Reality Orientation activities  ( see below )  are helpful to keep the brain working  any activity which uses the mind is important .  Care assistant

Other forms of recorded knowledge , such as microfilm , tape and <head>disc</head> recordings , film strips , slides and videotapes are kept in the library . In particular ,  there are significant microfilm collections at Jordanstown  and Coleraine  and 30,000 slides at Belfast  .  A modern library makes extensive use of information technology and it is frequently the case that students are tentative in making full use of such technology or are unaware of the wide range of services available .

Video - recording can be used ,  as with films ,  to create an atmosphere of reality and convey moving images ,  but these are requirements seldom met with in library instruction .  Short video - recorded programmes might well be used to illustrate lectures ,  as a means of creating interest .  Video - recording can make use of tape , film or <head>discs</head> for the actual storage of the recorded material . One of the problems facing libraries in the use of video material has been the lack of standardization between different systems .  It would appear that cassette systems are easier to use ,  as audio - cassettes ,  in library education .

All might still have been well were it not for the rupture - discs on the vents above the reactor .  Moeri considered these discs unnecessary for his low - pressure reaction ,  but he says Givaudan insisted on them because they were fashionable on all their equipment at the time .  Rupture - <head>discs</head> , however , simply open and let all the pressure escape . If proper security valves ,  which close after initial pressure is dissipated ,  had been used the pollution would have been much less ,  says Moeri .  Moeri 's  account of the accident could have a profound effect on the defence the company makes at the trial ,  which resumes on 11 May .

Sony ,  which has been furiously lobbying standards organisations and other makers of disc drives  ( the machinery that plays the discs )  to accept its design ,  makes a 3 - inch  ( 72 cm )  disc encased in a hard plastic cover .  Hitachi ,  with its partners Maxwell and Matsushita ,  has come up with a disc the same size ,  while a third combine headed by Seagate has opted for 3&frac14 ;  inch  ( 78 cm )  in an attempt to head off the Japanese competition .  Up to now the Japanese have not been leaders in <head>disc</head> design . From behind the Iron Curtain ,  a Hungarian firm called Budapest Radio Engineering has produced a 3 - inch  ( 7.2 cm )  microfloppy encased in a traditional cardboard cover .  The drive for this disc is cheaper than the others at 150 .
