The Ruchill Hospital Social work team and the AIDS Resource Unit were particularly helpful in identifying the need for this service .  Home care Coordinator ,  Margaret Gillies ,  currently has a team of 20 volunteers from a variety of churches providing practical help to a number of clients already referred .  Strathclyde Regional Council may <head>provide</head> further funding and consideration is being given to the possible employment of a part - time nurse . Margaret Gillies says ,  We are discovering the extent of the need for the kind of help that ACET offers from other support agencies including Scottish AIDS Monitor and Body Positive as well as hospital contacts and local counselling services .  Chris Southwick ,  director of ACET  ( Scotland )  ,  said ,  With the opening of this office in Glasgow ,  ACET 's  volunteer home care is now available to 95 of those infected with the HIV virus in Scotland .

Dear Friend As the number of people ill with AIDS increases so does the need for volunteers to care for them .  Over the last three years , our volunteers have <head>provided</head> much love and care to many hurt and lonely people . The support our volunteers provide cannot be measured in purely practical terms and their continuing contribution is vital if we are to provide an ongoing service .  In recognition of their importance and the need to train more volunteers ,  we want to develop links with individual churches .

Accusations continue of security force involvement in covert assassinations .

According to those at the vigil ,  the police only checked on the hose twice before the massacre occurred at 4am .

It takes imagination and a lot of practice to read a play to yourself in the same time as it would take to see it on the stage .  Surprisingly ,  this is true of both the classical and modern play ,  though you might expect that the obscurities and difficulties of words and expression would prove more of a stumbling block in ,  say ,  Shakespeare or Ben Jonson .  Here is a suggested first reading list , which I 've put together to <head>provide</head> a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's development . There is a danger in reading the classics ,  in that they can come to be regarded simply as literature  so always try to look at them as plays for performance   and ,  it goes without saying ,  try to see as much theatre as you can .  It 's  worthwhile reading some pre - Shakespearean drama ;  you could read Everyman  ,  a great morality play of the late Middle Ages ,  and Gammer Gurton 's  Needle  ,  first performed in 1566 and thought to be the second oldest English comedy .

As Gibbon has noted ,  the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles  ( 1975 :  3 )  .  The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic  nationalist and protestant  loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material interests of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions .  By <head>providing</head> core beliefs , and by reinforcing their separateness for both alliances , religious beliefs and institutions equally suppress class divisions , become embroiled in cementing alliances , and help retain the overall divisional structure of Ireland as a whole .

For centuries the Roman catholic church and faith were the bread of life to the subordinate classes in Ireland ,  deprived of their land ,  civil rights ,  and education .  The church not only provided solace and comfort in those long years ,  but also a vigorous identity which enabled its people to hold up their heads amid the persecution and oppression .  It <head>provided</head> intellectual and spiritual leadership and some alleviation from hunger and starvation . The clergy were the only source of education apart from the hedge school teachers  ( Dowling 1968 )  and provided a significant moral and organizational resource .  Several aspects of catholicism became particularly important in the nineteenth century .

An indicator of the growing importance of this totalizing view of education was contained in the 1841 rescript from Rome .  It announced that ,  if doctrine as opposed to Bible stories was to be a part of school education ,  then such religious education could not adopt a common denominator approach between the churches ,  but had to be total in its presentation of what the Roman catholic church considered to be the truth ,  otherwise such an approach would be dangerous for the children  ( Gaine 1968 :  164 )  .  The implementation of this policy was the work in part of the new Roman episcopal appointees , from Cullen onwards , though the growing hatred of the ascendancy because of the famine and their continued landownership must have <head>provided</head> ample cause for separate schools for the majority of Roman catholic clergy . Already in the 1850s ,  Roman catholic bishops attacked the setting up of the model schools ,  intended for the pursuit of educational experiments within a multi - denominational setting .  In 1860 ,  the rules on the composition of the National Education Board was changed to permit equal protestant and catholic representation .

The present interrelationship between control of the schools and the two alliances varies in each part of Ireland ,  though one should also bear in mind the additional underpinning of the alliances both North and South by one of the traditional values of bourgeois capitalism ,  private and selective schooling .  Throughout Ireland as a whole ,  there has generally been an anti - comprehensive ethos in the education system supportive of both class and sectarian divisions in schooling and which is now eroding only in part .  In Northern Ireland , the catholic schools ' sector is <head>provided</head> for out of state funds , and remains under the governorship of the local clergy , now assisted by laity and members of the local educational and library boards . Many Roman catholic schools up to 1968 were financed for capital expenditure by the local church as part of the church 's  determination not to lose control of them .  The chairman of the board is usually the parish priest or his curate .

The arrangement had been unchanged since the early years of the state and had become entirely natural .

The consequence of having such large schools with small protestant catchment areas was that those funded from the state had to make up numbers by accepting non - protestants .  The Roman catholic element in all the republic 's  protestant second - level schools varies from one school with 0 per cent to one school with 40 per cent of the total .  But some of the headmasters have a deliberate multi - denominational policy in terms of ethos and curriculum and the schools do <head>provide</head> multi - denominational settings which , if researched , could throw light on debates about denominational and shared schools . The current expansion and urban growth in the Southern population has also affected the protestant community ,  and the increased pressure on schools in urban areas ,  such as Dublin ,  is likely to lead to a diminution of the protestant - catholic character of most protestant schools ,  unless deliberate decisions are taken to preserve the balance .  What emerges from this brief overview is the dominant role of the clergy in Southern education .

A pub ,  like any other old building ,  is far more than just its principle facade ,  or its four walls .  As Neil Richardson noted in 1980 ,  An old town pub is not just an attractive Victorian or Georgian facade ,  it is a building which is still being used for the purpose for which it was built .  The design of interiors are as valid today as they were in earlier times the vaults , snugs , parlours , each with their own character , can still <head>provide</head> a pleasant , varied atmosphere . However ,  to public and professionals alike many old buildings are still regarded as representing little more than four external walls .  This even applies to listed buildings :  there is still a worryingly widespread general belief that listing only covers the facade ,  or perhaps just the exterior ,  whereas it is of course expressly designed to protect the whole  building .

Unless the winch or car is very under - powered ,  pulling up steeper on a fast launch has little or no effect on launching speed .

Unexpected stalls Most unintentional stalls occur ,  by definition ,  unexpectedly and usually the first obvious sign of what has happened is that the pilot is banging the stick on the rear stop with the nose still dropping  a frightening feeling .  However , <head>provided</head> that a movement forwards is made to unstall , the possibility of a full spin will have been avoided . The order of movements is relatively unimportant compared to the necessity of making an immediate forward movement to reduce the angle of attack of the wing so that it unstalls .  If you imagine suddenly and unexpectedly finding yourself in an almost vertical dive facing the ground ,  it is easy to understand why so many pilots fail to make a movement forward on the stick to help the glider unstall itself .

Many incidents and accidents are caused by lack of experience and the pilot unwittingly putting himself into situations beyond his capabilities .  For example ,  it is important for an inexperienced solo pilot to avoid a field landing until he has had some training in how to tackle one .  Hundreds of landings on one particular airfield or gliding site do not <head>provide</head> good training for landing in fields . Unfortunately ,  being familiar with an approach takes away much of the need for real judgement .  Pilots ,  and even instructors ,  often believe that they have good judgement and can land accurately anywhere because they can manage on their own site .

Pilots should be encouraged to make an assessment during the final turn of how much airbrake they will need as they start to straighten up for the final approach ,  instead of waiting until the turn is completed at which point it is already too late .  The use of the airbrakes during the final turn should be discussed and pilots should be encouraged to try it if they are too high .  It should be emphasised that there is no reason to discourage any but the most inexperienced solo pilots from opening the airbrakes in the final turn , <head>provided</head> the glider is not already low ( or slow ) . Inability to sideslip effectively with full airbrake on the final approach Sideslipping takes skill and practice .

This time it will almost certainly drop a wing ,  but just easing forwards a little will make a recovery .

At times it is even possible to lay out for examination the intense post - liminal rites and ceremonies of reincorporation required by the police institution as it seeks to draw the marginal mover back into the fold .  Usually ,  however ,  the social move is merely in the form of a transfer within well - developed sections of police society where the new experience is structured by the same ideology and beliefs which have gone before .  Occasionally , however , the insider is moved across a new boundary severe enough to create a rite of separation and <head>provide</head> the scope for an introspective analysis to generate something akin to a new vision . In this situation ,  the marginal mover acquires the power to reinterpret the way his institutional structure governs a desire for a rigidified world of immobility ,  and to understand why ,  for example ,  those few policemen who move into other areas ,  such as probation work or the legal profession ,  become totally suspect .  Transition to the outside destroys the manufactured reality of one real world and two ex - police probation officers I knew became  the equivalent of potential prigs .

Furthermore ,  the reading I did for the lectures I was called to give as a drugs expert generated queries about such ambiguous areas as victimless crimes and interference in private acts ,  and altogether raised more questions than were solved .  This acquisition of special knowledge meant that when I was called to give evidence to the Advisory Council on Drug Abuse  ( chaired by Baroness Wooton )  on the use of cannabis ,  I was perhaps more inclined to dwell on the symbolic dangers attributed to its use than on any alleged physical harm ,  simply because I was now aware that any reality in relation to cannabis use was more complex than could be contained in some easy binary of social value  medical debilitation .  Such awareness <head>provided</head> another means for the obsessive anxieties of the establishment to be counterbalanced from within , and as Jacobi ( 1967 : 22 ) suggests , created the potential ability to look truths in the eye and the courage to renounce what is no longer compatible . This ,  however ,  produces a further paradox ,  for this reflexive style ,  welding the practical mastery and special knowledge of the subjective insider to an objective interpretation of events is not one the institution of policing is  geared up to handle .  We were now floating between a world of the street - wise ,  the gentle hippie ,  the communal crash pad ,  the lecture hall ,  the courts ,  the addiction unit or hospital casualty department ,  and the front page .

Finally ,  mats are very often spongy ,  requiring you to lift your foot well clear before stepping .  Obviously you cannot know in advance which type of mat will be used at a particular tournament ,  so you should do your final training on any type of mat ,  just to get used to the feel ,  and then try to use any free time you may have on the actual competition areas to get a little practice in beforehand .  Some competitions <head>provide</head> a warm - up area matted with the same material as the actual competition area . Check this out and use it if it is available .

For example ,  consider the scooping block response to the front kick .  In the first photograph ,  the defender has twisted his hips away from the kick and faces 120 to the incoming technique .  The purpose of this is to <head>provide</head> a more effective deflection . But notice that in order to respond effectively the defender must now twist all the way back ,  because sideways - on there is little he can do to score .  Compare this with the slide - back scooping block which uses the same technique but does not turn the body away .

Thus the advance is made a split second after discerning the opponent 's  attack .  However ,  those of a more robust spirit will thrust directly into the opponent 's  attack ,  staking all on a combination block and counter .  Actually , <head>providing</head> your timing is reasonable , this is not too dangerous , because you will be interrupting the attacking technique close to its source , when it is at its weakest . Reverse block For this type of block you slide diagonally forwards so that the angle of your advance takes you clear of the opponent 's  front kick .

Perhaps the particular potentials he is recording are not causally linked with the conscious experiences he is investigating ?

And the finding that it takes 400 msec to generate the electrical activity associated with the meaning of visually presented words suggests that this is one of the most complex activities our perceptual systems are asked to perform .  These experiments tell us a great deal about certain aspects of cognitive processes ,  particularly their relative timing or sequencing .  They also <head>provide</head> circumstantial evidence for a close relationship between mind and brain . They have shown that mental processes can be correlated with specific neural changes .  This is a necessary condition for a reductionist view of the mind but ,  particularly given the absence of any effective demonstration of a causal connection between the mental and the neural ,  it is certainly not a  sufficient condition .

This is not to say that folk psychology already has adequate theories of perception ,  language ,  memory or any other cognitive process .  Indeed ,  the data from patients with brain injury that I will be discussing in the final two sections are very puzzling indeed from the standpoint of folk psychology .  The point is simply that the account of mental processes which folk psychology <head>provides</head> , constitutes an explanation at an appropriate level of abstraction for the purposes of explaining behaviour scientifically . It should be emphasized that this level of explanation does not commit the functionalist to a belief in any non - physical substances or processes .  Most ,  perhaps all ,  functionalists are thorough - going materialists who believe that mental phenomena are genuine physical  phenomena seen at a particular level of abstraction .

If it is really necessary to think of mental states as having qualitative content  ( and see Dennett ,  1988 ,  for some powerful arguments that it is not )  ,  then it follows from functionalism that such qualia do not have causal interactions with other mental states or behaviour and are mere epiphenomena .  Successful Science The sceptic might , at this point , complain that while I may have sketched out the functionalist position , I have not <head>provided</head> any convincing arguments as to why one should believe it . What I now want to suggest is that there is a lot of very successful science currently being conducted which literally depends on functionalism being true .  If functionalism is false ,  then the success of the cognitive sciences is a massive scientific fluke .

This means that they are able to retrieve the appropriate pronunciation of a word as a whole from the speech output lexicon .  The dual - route model of reading is thus able not only to explain an existing set of data within a simple theoretical model ,  it also successfully pinpointed the existence of an entirely new type of acquired dyslexia .  Moreover , a closer look at individual patients <head>provides</head> support for what was said about the heterogeneity of groups at the start of this section . So ,  the more that surface dyslexics are studied ,  the more it becomes obvious that the condition fractionates ;  there are important differences between individual surface dyslexics .  These differences can also be accommodated by the dual route model .

Since brain damage can produce these very precise differences between patients ,  it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there is one part of the brain that has the precise function of carrying out each piece of information processing that is specified within the cognitive model .  It seems to me to be perverse in the extreme to attempt to resist the claim that the brain is literally carrying out these functions .  Cognitive neuropsychology thus <head>provides</head> powerful evidence that the level of analysis which functionalists use to describe brain processes is the correct one .

I now turn to a consideration of some implications of the cognitive neuropsychology of face recognition for phenomenology  an approach to the mind and mental phenomena that gives prominence to introspectible phenomena understood as acts of consciousness and their immediate objects .  Phenomenologists such as Dreyfus  ( 1972 )  argue that the level of explanation utilized in cognitive science does not truly exist .  The physical brain and the world of introspectible phenomenal experience are all that there really is : no cognitive psychologist has succeeded in defining another sort of input between these two which would <head>provide</head> the ultimate bits of information to which rules are applied ( p. 199 ) . My favourite phenomenological quote ,  however ,  comes from Jennings  ( 1986 )  :  social psychologists spent years conducting experiments to specify the exact parameters of a hypothetical motivational state called cognitive dissonance

Suggested Reading Although neither have been cited directly in the text ,  the philosophical ideas in this chapter have been heavily influenced by the work of Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn .  Fodor ( 1981 ) <head>provides</head> a very clear description of functionalism , and his book The Modularity of Mind discusses some of the philosophical issues surrounding cognitive neuropsychology . Pylyshyn  ( 1984 )   contains an important account of the relationship between cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence ,  and Pylyshyn  ( 1973 )  contains an interesting discussion of the differences between cognitive science and phenomenology .  A very clear introduction to current work in cognitive neuropsychology is provided by Ellis and Young  ( 1988 )  .
