For the latter he quoted a sentence by Lucian ,  the second - century Greek rhetorician :  A work of art requires an intelligent spectator who must go beyond the pleasure of the eyes to express a judgement and to argue the reasons for what he sees .  For Venturi ,  an important development in art criticism came in the eighteenth century which saw the foundation of aesthetics and the rise of philosophies for which art was an indispensable ingredient .  Writing as he was in the 1930s , he <head>expressed</head> his pleasure at the extensive documentation and reference material available to the student of art , instancing the growth of libraries and art historical teaching . If he were alive today ,  he would have even more cause for satisfaction .  Some of the main efforts of historians in the first decades of the twentieth century had been directed to putting order into a mass of material ,  analysing works and documents ,  and establishing historical data .

Another famous figure ,  Joan Mir ,  initially praised by Breton as the most Surrealist painter ,  later described his Surrealist phase as having lasted only for a matter of months .  A personal friend of an artist may have a real advantage in writing criticism ,  as he may learn about artistic intentions which are not explained to others .  This places a critic in a privileged position , but also with a responsibility to make clear whether views <head>expressed</head> are those of the critic or those of the artist . This distinction can be limpid if the artist is directly interviewed ,  and the interview is verbatim ;  but there are problems of evidence with filming and tape recordings ,  as well as with interviews ,  since the viewer or reader is unlikely to know how they have been edited .

Gertrude Stein later wrote a book on Picasso ,  in which she put the point like this :  One must never forget that the reality of the twentieth century is not the reality of the nineteenth century ,  not at all and Picasso was the only one in painting who felt it ,  the only one .  More and more the struggle to <head>express</head> it intensified . Matisse and all the others saw the twentieth century with their eyes but they saw the reality of the nineteenth century ,  Picasso was the only one in painting who saw the twentieth century with his eyes and saw its reality and consequently his struggle was terrifying ,  terrifying for himself and for the others ,  because he had nothing to help him ,  the past did not help him ,  nor the present ,  he had to do it all alone and ,  in spite of much strength he is often very weak ,  he consoled himself and allowed himself to be seduced by other things which led him more or less astray .  In its slightly earlier day ,  pointillism had also had a progressive artistic programme .

The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have difficulty in deciding how far the picture needs  to be considered as devotional imagery ,  and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits .  An extremist view <head>expressed</head> by a twentieth - century artist is what Matisse had to say about his responses to murals by Giotto . When I see the Giotto frescoes at Padua I do not trouble to recognise which scene in the life of Christ I have before me ,  but I perceive instantly the sentiment which radiates from it and which is instinct in the composition in every line and  color  .  The title will only serve to confirm my impression .

And they will undoubtedly object to the more unbridled formulations that enter the three fictions ;  the biography of Eliot has plenty to say on the subject ,  too ,  while maintaining a comparative ,  and suitable ,  reserve .  They wo n't accept with Charles Wychwood that everything is copied ,  and wo n't accept his opinion of Chatterton :  Thomas Chatterton believed that he could explain the entire material and spiritual world in terms of imitation and forgery ,  and so sure was he of his own genius that he allowed it to flourish under other names .  The second half of this can be seen to coincide with the opinion of Chatterton which is <head>expressed</head> by Ackroyd 's Wilde : a strange , slight boy who was so prodigal of his genius that he attached the names of others to it . Peter Ackroyd has here performed the not impossible feat of plagiarising himself  while leaving the reader in doubt as to whether the writer shares this implausible estimate of Chatterton 's  marvellous buoyancy .  As Ackroyd 's  ventriloquised Wilde makes clear ,  Wilde was a great exaggerator and ,  like his friend Whitman ,  a great contradictor of himself ;  and he is certainly a great source of dualistic formulations ,  in all their slippery bliss .

The shifting consensus of church and state was not the major feature of the period .

They were both cases <head>expressing</head> the consensus of politician and priest . The major debates after that time have tended to show a split between church leadership and a large section of its laity on the one hand ,  and a significant proportion of Roman catholic laity ,  other churches ,  and secular groups on the other. In this confrontation ,  the traditional religious forces ,  which support the old monopoly religious structure ,  have so far prevailed .

The forum completed its consultations and reported in the Summer of 1984 .  There was one vital breakthrough for the nationalist consciousness ,  though there still remains some doubt as to how deep this was for the Fianna Fil party :  all the parties committed themselves to the recognition of the protestant  loyalist group as having legitimate aspirations and affirmed the need for the recognition of two sets of legitimate rights coexisting in the island as a whole :  Constitutional nationalists are determined to secure justice for all traditions The new Ireland must be a society within which , subject only to public order , all cultural , political and religious beliefs can be freely <head>expressed</head> and practised . This was made explicit in terms of the sense of British identity which protestant loyalists experience :  This implies in particular ,  in respect of Northern protestants ,  that the civil and religious liberties that they uphold and enjoy will be fully protected and their sense of Britishness accommodated  ( New Ireland Forum 19834 :  i .  223 )  .  For the very first time ,  the leadership of all the major constitutional nationalist parties in Ireland ,  representing 90 per cent of the nationalist population ,  had abandoned the concept of the tyranny of the majority will .

Like other symbolic non - verbal devices ,  the multi - vocal nuances of our uniform were used in a variety of other ways as boundary markers to maintain our cultural identity and define our institutional specificities .

That passionate love of music as movement is what Rachmaninov 's  Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini  is all about .

In composing the Rhapsody  ,  Rachmaninov tried to vary the Paganini theme as much as  possible by differentiating the instrumental sections one from another .  Whereas Symphonic Variations  flows onwards in simple serenity ,  Ashton ,  following Rachmaninov ,  here uses an enormous variety of steps and constantly changes the choreographic phrasing to reflect the increasing or diminishing sounds and to match the tempi of the melody ,  in order to give his enchanements  light and shade and to indicate the sheer complexity of the orchestration .

There are other ways in which choreographers can be guided by the musical context other than those already cited .

In the fourth ,  Man ,   with the help of the three soloists from the other movements ,  overcame the bat - like figure representing Fate .

He can only highlight the atmosphere supporting the plot ,  especially those circumstances where he has to portray differences between classes and thus general behaviour ,  idiosyncrasies ,  etc. ,  for example the contrast that must be made between the dances for all and sundry in the town square and those for the aristocrats in the ballroom of Romeo and Juliet  .  Nevertheless every choreographer creating this kind of romantic ballet today has to spend much time creating the proper gestures to replace the words ,  which in such ballets are never spoken but must be understood .  If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will <head>express</head> the moods , emotions and actions of the characters they play . This is what happens in MacMillan 's  Romeo and Juliet  and Ashton 's  A Month in the Country  .  It is perhaps appropriate to stress again that where playwrights require pages of dialogue to explain every factor in the development of the plot ,  to create a changing atmosphere and to show how the actions affect the actors in the play ,  dancers can communicate whole passages of dialogue in a few expressive gestures woven into enchanements  .

They must also be performed and co - ordinated with the occupational gestures that belong to the location and that are employed by the particular inhabitants whose story ,  with its moods ,  emotions and actions ,  is being told .  This means that natural emotional expression must also be folded into the design .  This is probably the most difficult material to handle because the many characters and nationalities involved in the various available libretti must <head>express</head> themselves as distinctively as they do in real life and the choreographer must try and ensure his design has some semblance of reality if it is to communicate meaning . It was in this particular field of difficulty that Balanchine sometimes showed his deep understanding .

With regard to the debate about c  and Doppler shifts in the letters pages ,  light  ( velocity c  )  reflected or emitted from a surface moving with velocity v  towards an observer appears to be blue shifted ,  or red shifted in the case of a receding surface .  As a non - physicist I have often wondered if the difference in photon energy  (  E '  E = hf '  hf  )  of the shifted and unshifted light could be wholly accounted for by the effect of the surface velocity  (  v  )  acting together with the particle equivalent mass of the photon .  The extra energy not being allowed to be <head>expressed</head> as an increase in c appears as a commensurate increase in f , that is : ( formula included ) where m is the photon equivalent mass ( yes I know it is related to E but I am trying not to confuse myself ) , E is the energy , and h is Mr Plank 's claim to fame .

Conservative Western military analysts have <head>expressed</head> scepticism about Soviet statements that they are removing from their armed forces both the capability and the doctrine of a large - scale attack on western Europe . Francois Heisbourg ,  the institute 's  director ,  said that growing tensions between different members of the Warsaw Pact are undermining its ability to act as an alliance .  Although the east European states individually retain strong bi - lateral links with Moscow ,  he said ,  the differing attitudes to reform mean that there is clearly a group of countries who are no longer in alliance with another group .

She pushed through the cordon anyway ,  and stayed in church until 3am ,  through all the worst of the police violence .  It was then that she read Angela Kunze 's  manifesto ,  written in blue on a long ribbon of paper above her head where she rests against the wall :  I am fasting to cleanse myself of fear and hopelessness ,  hate and violence ,  impatience and the lust for novelty .  I am fasting because I see no other way to <head>express</head> my protest against the ways in which our politicians brazenly keep up appearances and celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the state as their victory . I am fasting because ,  unlike our state media ,  I am worried about the great number of people who have left our country .  I am fasting to live in solidarity with all who suffer and are persecuted because they have committed themselves to social justice .

The issues about which respondents expressed concern included  the use made of the results by ,  variously ,  the police authorities and the IRA ,  and the associated question of whether the field - worker was a spy for the authorities or the Republican paramilitaries  ( on researchers as spies see Hunt 1984 :  2889 ;  Manning 1972 :  248 )  ;  the obtrusiveness of the ethnographer 's  ubiquitous notepad ;  sensitivity to how the research might compromise their personal security or lead to a transfer ,  and worthies over the field - worker 's  religion ;  and the whole focus and topic of the investigation .  Concern about our motives in doing the research was combined with a feeling that it would do those participating in it little good ,  but would certainly benefit those in the police management and outside who wanted to do them harm .  Variations on the fears <head>expressed</head> below reappear many times in the field notes . The way we look at it is ,  there 's  people out there want to kill me ,  and the authorities let you in here and give you access to more than we will probably ever get .  It 's  OK for the authorities because it 's  not them you 're looking at  you wo n't be walking the beat with them .

For example ,  Manning  ( 1977 )  showed how policemen and women in the ranks have an ability to bypass or undermine innovations introduced by police managers ,  some even doing so while appearing to endorse the policy change  ( Chatterton 1979 )  .  Holdaway  ( 1977 )  documented the difficulties police managers in Hilton had in overcoming wellaccepted practices in order to introduce more professional police practice in the form of unit beat policing .  While advocates of community policing <head>express</head> confidence in its ability to effect improvements ( Alderson 1979 , 1982 ; Scarman 1981 ) , research contradicts this by pointing to resistance from those constables who are responsible for it or to organizational constraints ( Fielding et al . 1988 ;  Grimshaw and Jefferson 1987 ;  Trojanowicz and Harden 1985 )  ,  although there are a number of other studies which emphasize its success in overcoming public hostility to the police  ( Brown and Iles 1985 ;  McKane 1980 ;  cf. Cumberbatch 1983 ,  Taylor - Griffiths 1988 )  .  Nor is the idea of community policing popular amongst ordinary constables in other sections of the police ,  often because it contradicts their views of what constitutes real police work ,  but also because they have misguided notions about what community policing is ,  as well as a practical awareness of the unrealistic expectations held of it by enthusiasts .

Greatest difficulty is likely to occur in relation to attitudual and psychographic data .

That same year he worried over Slum Areas concerned about overcrowding and the possible creation of new slums .  But it was the city 's  spiritual health which most preoccupied him ,  though he realized spiritual and economic were not always inseparable .  In a paragraph whose subtitle , City , City , harks back to The Waste Land , he <head>expressed</head> astonishment that in an economic slump the City was pulling down buildings to erect ever more splendid banks . Eliot was fond of familiar details of a London which ,  in a sense ,  he had known all his life ,  ever since the childhood reading of Sherlock Holmes which he recalled in 1929 .  It was his own spiritual change which made possible after the poems of the early twenties a more affectionate view of London ,  but we should not assume that the owner of Down the Silver Stream of Thames  had ever been totally blind to the beauty of the city .

But in the 1970s few self - made first generation Conservative politicians had personal memories of the 1930s ,  or were any longer inclined to conciliate the trade unions and make the avoidance of unemployment the main goal of economic policy .  In public and private she is a relentless educator .  An important task of leadership , in her view , is to win the battle of ideas , and this is done by frequently <head>expressing</head> basic beliefs and principles . She seems to revel in arguments and loses no opportunity to declare her political principles .  Initially Shadow Cabinet colleagues were worried by her view of politics as an ideological battle ground and by her disavowal of many cross bench attitudes  ( Chapter 1 )  .

Apart from Nigel Lawson ,  Nicholas Ridley ,  Cecil Parkinson ,  and Sir Geoffrey Howe ,  it was difficult to think of other Cabinet ministers who would be regarded as economically dry or ideologically Thatcherite ,  and both Lawson and Sir Geoffrey had well - publicized differences of opinion with Mrs Thatcher .  Mrs Thatcher 's  style certainly contributed to the Cabinet divisions between 1979 and 1981 and again after 1987 .  She has strong views on most issues and her propensity to <head>express</head> her views boldly at the outset of a Cabinet discussion , combined with a sometimes dismissive attitude towards opposing colleagues , tended to change the atmosphere and polarize Cabinet discussions . This contrasted with the approach of some other Prime Ministers .  Attlee ,  Macmillan ,  Wilson ,  and Callaghan often waited for a policy line in Cabinet discussion to emerge before committing themselves .

She has not approached the senior civil service ,  local authorities ,  universities ,  trade unions ,  BBC ,  Church of England ,  the legal and medical professions ,  and public corporations with the reverence  or at least respect  with which Burke recommended that we regard the work of our ancestors .  Sir Ian Gilmour ,  a member of Mrs Thatcher 's  Cabinet until his dismissal in 1981 ,  has been the most articulate critic of the new Conservatism .  His views have been <head>expressed</head> in numerous speeches and newspaper articles and in two learned and witty books , Inside Right and Britain Can Work . He claims that Conservatism is not an idea ,  still less is it a system of ideas and that the Conservative tradition is marked by scepticism ,  a sense of the limitations of human reason ,  a rejection of abstraction or abstract doctrines ,  a distrust of systems and a belief in the importance of experience and circumstances .  He invokes Burke in his opposition to a priori politics and to the application of systematic and abstract schemes and policies .

He tended to blame many of the ills of the Conservative Party on the self - serving apparatchiks of Conservative Central Office ,  and many of the ills of the country on the petty - fogging of parliamentary life .  These jibes at the old gang ,  a phrase Maxse used frequently ,  are of course reminiscent of Oswald Mosley ,  and on occasion Maxse did veer towards a rather Fascistic Caesarism ,  calling for a Leader to save the nation .  However , if one compares Maxse 's views with those <head>expressed</head> by W. C. Bridgeman an interesting picture emerges . Bridgeman was ,  according to his obituary ,  an admirable type of the English country gentleman  ( who )  did much for the Church ,  for education ,  especially in rural districts ,  for the Navy ,  for agriculture and for sport ,  particularly for his favourite game of cricket .  In other words ,  as Philip Williamson 's  excellent edition of his diary and letters demonstrates .

At the top of the atrium ,  the pitched - roof - profile roof - light was made larger than was strictly necessary in order to provide a conservatory complete with tropical plants  ( Plate 48 )  which leads out on to a landscaped roof garden capping the western half of the building .  It is clear that some provision of communal rooms is important in the conversion of old buildings to multiple occupation ,  and consistent with other comparable projects analysed in this book ,  the common room of Thames Tunnel Mills is logically located at ground - floor level .  However , the architects ' view is that this communal aspect of the building is most clearly <head>expressed</head> architecturally by the central atrium , a space overlooked by the lift lobbies and the galleries of each upper floor that gives access to the flats . The difficulties encountered in negotiating all the necessary approvals ,  particularly the funding ,  for a scheme which departed from the norm of fair rent housing explain the exceptionally long period of four years that preceded commencement of the building contract .  A major problem that arose at an early stage was the reconciliation of the local authority 's  requirements for one car - parking space per flat with the DoE 's  refusal to fund a scheme in which the entire ground floor would be used for parking .

Many of Charles 's  ideas sprang from a memorable visit to Boston in September 1986 ,  when he had been invited to speak at the Harvard 350th Commemoration Ceremony .  It was an opportunity to talk about education and America ,  an irresistible combination as far as he was concerned ,  for which he happily interrupted his holiday at Balmoral .  There was no pool of academics or professionals contributing to this talk ; it was a speech very much from the heart , and the thoughts <head>expressed</head> mocked by the tabloids , needless to say , as philosophical ramblings are still very relevant today . I have heard a great deal about Harvard  who has n't ?  After all ,  it has produced a cornucopia of leaders for the United States in many fields ,  not to mention the fact that six Harvard men have become president of the United States .

But perhaps the most exciting years were the early years of the development of the Christian Club Conference into the Frontier Youth Trust for Christian Club Work .  Philip was at the forefront of this development .  As the Club Conference Committee was struggling to <head>express</head> this wider vision in an initial Statement of Aims , it was Philip in 1964 who produced the winning title that we all now take for granted Frontier Youth Trust . The Rev E P Tompson was the first Chairman of its Executive Committee and in that capacity led the work forward to the point at which it was accepted as the youth club arm of Scripture Union ,  and a member of the SU Council assumed the chair .  His work as a leading founder member was invaluable .

And at Ealing itself ,  Balcon 's  post - war ambition for a cinema that would project the true Briton to the rest of the world as a leader in social reform ,  champion of civil liberties had shrivelled by the end of the 1950s to a commitment to make films about day - dreamers ,  mild anarchists ,  little men who long to kick the boss in the teeth .  There were complex reasons behind the shift in each individual 's  creative potential .  Powell and Pressburger could n't find the stories that <head>expressed</head> what they wanted to say to a contemporary audience , Reed suffered a loss of nerve after making two exceptional films with Graham Greene ( Fallen Idol and The Third Man ) . Lean drew strength from being such a cerebral filmmaker ,  while Mackendrick had the advantage of being a  ( Scottish )  outsider in the very English setting of Ealing studios .  Hamer ,  by contrast ,  was not only unable to flourish inside Ealing ,  where his projects were now considered too risqu ,  but unable to thrive outside .

For a start ,  did n't Mrs Thatcher have some justification for concluding that Mr Lawson had deliberately chosen the Walters row as an excuse for abandoning ship ?  Certainly his resignation ensures that he will be in the clear when the economic roof falls in  an event which many people now regard as virtually inevitable .  The second aspect is the extent to which recent events prove that politicians should avoid <head>expressing</head> the obvious , because it always leads to trouble . Take ,  for instance ,  the brouhaha which has followed Mrs Thatcher 's  hint that she will probably retire sometime between the next general election and the one after that .  This was made the payoff in the Sunday Correspondent 's  interview with the PM ,  though it has since emerged that the sequence of the conversation was altered .

This is why the CIA during the 50s and 60s covertly supported a multitude of initiatives whose aim was to present the new American Art across the world as a promise for the future .  Since the works  ( de Kooning apart )  were abstract they lent themselves to diverse interpretations .  In this way a mostly desperate body of art , which had at first shocked the American public , was transformed by speeches , articles and the context in which it was displayed , into an ideological weapon for the defence of Individualism and the right to <head>express</head> oneself . Pollock ,  I 'm sure ,  was unaware of this programme  he died too soon ;  nevertheless the propaganda apparatus helped to create the confusion surrounding his art after his death .  A cry of despair was turned into a Declaration for Democracy .
