If you have not paid tax ,  then you would not be able to sign a Certificate of Deduction of Tax and ACET would not be able to reclaim tax on the covenant .  If ACET did somehow reclaim tax on the covenant then you would be liable to pay income tax to the Inland Revenue on the amount of your covenant payment .  So if you are not a UK taxpayer you are advised not to enter into Deeds of Covenant , but to make your regular charitable payments by <head>simple</head> Banker 's Order without any covenant . You may in fact find that you do pay some tax in the UK .  If you have dividend or receive bank or building society interest on which tax has been paid ,  tax will have been deducted at source ,  and this will enable you to sign a Certificate of Deduction of Tax so that ACET can obtain the advantages of covenant giving .

2 .  How does Gift Aid work ?  The mechanism of Gift Aid is very <head>simple</head> . Provided the gift is at least 600 it will be regarded as having been paid net of basic rate tax .  The charity is able to recover the basic rate tax deducted and the donor can ,  if appropriate ,  obtain higher rate tax relief on his payment .

ART CRITICISM AND ART HISTORY Do art historians write about the past ,  while art critics write about the present ?  Things are not so <head>simple</head> , as some art historians write well about the present , with a generosity of feeling and approach enriching to contemporary culture . They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,  partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro ,  who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,  was an open - minded historian of this sort .

Interpretation is the heading which is the most wide - ranging of the three elements ,  including questions of  form or style ,  but perhaps additionally considering the work 's  historical background ,  and technical ,  thematic or other questions ,  including the artist 's  biography .  The evaluation is a summing up which places the work in the experience of the critic ,  and helps the reader to form a judgement .  The plan of the book , then , is <head>simple</head> . After the first two chapters ,  it discusses where and how to read art criticism .  While this first chapter has outlined what that criticism is ,  the next gives sketches of half a dozen critical types .

In his view the independence of modernism in art has been further subverted by the demonstration of the necessarily intertextual nature of the production of meaning .  Cultural history and theory ,  it has to be said ,  have very extensive agenda ,  and art criticism is perhaps only a sub - paragraph under a secondary heading .  The reader may be doomed to disappointment in reading through an article with wide contextual terms of reference if looking for something as <head>simple</head> as descriptions of works of art , their interpretation and evaluation . Articles of synthesis between art and other subjects may include important art criticism .  Literary theory is at present in demand as a point of reference for writing on the visual arts .

The society may be symbolised by such dealings ,  and experienced through them .  Hardship and discontent may declare themselves there ,  in a victim 's  revenge .  In addressing itself to such possibilities , however , A Bend in the River , for all its air of simplicity , is never <head>simple</head> . Its narrator and chief human presence is by no means straightforwardly a victim ,  and the difference between oppressor and oppressed can be hard to identify .  The novel is narrated by a Moslem of Indian origin ,  whose family has been settled on the east coast of Africa ,  as traders .

This is a nice fellow speaking .  Because Sandy was embarked on a marriage and a career pointing him in a more conventional direction than mine ,  planning the sort of life that looked to me to have more obviously evolved from the background I 'd put behind me ,  it did n't seem to me that he would have had the wherewithal  morally ,  as I would have been quick to say then  to help me through my predicament or ,  if he did ,  that it was possible for me  with my values  ,  to solicit his assistance .  This was hubris , pure and <head>simple</head> Zuckerman 's  relationship with his brother Henry is ,  in contrast ,  often sanguinary ,  as gruesome as their respective operations .  Zuckerman Unbound   ( 1981 )  reaches its climax at one of Roth 's  frequent funerals  in this case ,  that of Zuckerman 's  father  after which Henry charges Nathan with killing their parent by writing that book ,  the liberated Carnovsky  ,  and with believing like the bastard he is that fiction does n't have consequences .

All training for the theatre is aiming to produce a person with all - round performing skills ,  equipped and ready to work in the world of entertainment .  It is easy to understand this ,  but it 's  not so easy to evaluate the different elements of theatre training ,  and see just how they contribute to the making of that elusive thing ,  a compleat actor .  I have always considered drama training to be based on <head>simple</head> precepts , for acting is not a complicated art . It may be difficult ,  but it is not complicated ,  and if it gets complicated there is something quite wrong .  Above all acting is not an intellectual occupation ,  though a good mind is needed to respond imaginatively and practically to the work of authors and directors .

The end has to be built in .  Otherwise as meaningless as any other gesture ,  as deeply rooted in the moment ,  in how one is feeling or what one has eaten or who one has been seeing .

Whereas I ,  wrote Harsnet ,  have become something of an expert on real endings ,  on true endings .  The real end must be like counting one then two then three .

In contrast ,  the restaurant manager is far less easy to define .  I would argue that they are as charismatic as chefs and yet their skills are less tangible and harder to gauge .  Perhaps their essence is more difficult to grasp because they are perceived by customers in entirely different roles , depending on the customer for example , as friend , wine expert or <head>simple</head> emissary of the kitchen . Tact and diplomacy ,  knowledge and friendship define the great restaurant managers ,  just as a great chef is defined by his skills in producing superb food .  The kitchen 's  perception of the restaurant manager is also fragmented in that the kitchen expects that manager to feed back customer response .

That is ,  with a path slap down the middle ,  a flanking washing line and four narrow borders around the edge .  The effect is similar to dressing a tall man in a pinstripe suit  it simply accentuates the length !  In fact , gardens that are long and narrow are among the more <head>simple</head> to design because they can be broken down very easily into separate garden areas or rooms , each of them having a different function or theme . This philosophy ,  though on a far grander scale ,  can be observed in practice in such great gardens as Sissinghurst in Kent and Hidcote Manor in Gloucestershire ,  where similar plants and colour combinations have been placed in walled or hedged parts of the larger garden .  Long narrow plots often adjoin older properties and this can give you the opportunity of working existing trees and shrubs into the new design .
