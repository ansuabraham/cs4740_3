Although ACET ,  like any charity ,  does not have the power to release you from the agreement it is likely to be sympathetic .  For instance we can suggest ways of rescheduling the payments over a longer period .  Whatever happens , any tax relief obtained on donations you have already made will not be <head>lost</head> . It is possible to include in the wording of the Deed that the covenant will cease if certain conditions occur  for example ,  if you become unemployed or your income falls below a certain level .  But ,  unless you are considering a particularly large donation ,  it is unlikely that you would need to include any complicated form of wording .

An occasional exploit deservedly catches the newspaper headlines ,  like the case of a picture spotted by a London dealer ,  David Carritt .  Sothebys were unfortunate enough to misattribute a French eighteenth - century picture ,  which was in fact by Fragonard .  Carritt bought it , correctly identified it as a <head>lost</head> early work , and magnanimously sold it to the National Gallery , London , far below the market price . Auction catalogues do not carry critical comments on individual items for sale ,  but there are sometimes introductions with criticism .  An example is the catalogue of paintings by Nol Coward ,  which was prefaced by a memoir of the playwright ,  describing his interest in painting .

Roth 's  turn towards fact  admittedly ,  an imagined and far from indisputable fact  will appear to some to signal a turn towards the self and towards the outside world .

In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 ,  while an extensive health bill was going through parliament ,  the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority ,  without qualification ,  is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family ,  the Church in education ,  the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions  (  Irish Independent  ,  12 Apr. 1951 ,  quoted Whyte 1980 :  143 )  .  It appeared that one of the main sources of the bishops '  opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation .  That the bishops were affected by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme clearly they stood to <head>lose</head> money and independence if such a scheme were implemented seems likely . Whereas similar provisions in other countries were mainly designed to provide facilities which could or could not be used ,  the Irish ones were to be compulsory and there was to be no choice of doctor .  The hierarchy feared the move as the thin end of the wedge of secularism and the totalitarian state .

However , they did state that , in a united Ireland , Northern protestants would not <head>lose</head> any civil and religious rights ( New Ireland Forum 19834 : xii . 2 )  .

Throughout Ireland as a whole ,  there has generally been an anti - comprehensive ethos in the education system supportive of both class and sectarian divisions in schooling and which is now eroding only in part .  In Northern Ireland ,  the catholic schools '  sector is provided for out of state funds ,  and remains under the governorship of the local clergy ,  now assisted by laity and members of the local educational and library boards .  Many Roman catholic schools up to 1968 were financed for capital expenditure by the local church as part of the church 's determination not to <head>lose</head> control of them . The chairman of the board is usually the parish priest or his curate .  With the exception of a small group of public schools ,  there is the apparently simple distinction between state schools and Roman catholic schools which occurs in Britain .

It is important for these pilots to develop the habit of checking the position of the gliding site immediately after releasing the tow and to re - check it regularly every few circles .  It is also important to be aware of the wind direction and the amount of drift ,  and to avoid drifting down wind whenever possible .  Beginners often continue to struggle with weak lift without realising that they are , in fact , <head>losing</head> height and drifting further away . If the variometer is fluctuating and reading up on one side of the circle and down a little on the other ,  the probability is that the glider is not climbing at all but is just drifting further down wind .  If the glider is down wind of the site ,  the decision to return must be taken before the glider gets to less than an angle of about 20 to the field in light winds ,  and 3040 in windy weather .

The following remarks apply particularly to the roundhouse kick and the side kick and only to a lesser extent to the front kick .  I have repeatedly stressed the importance of keeping your centre - line turned towards the opponent ,  yet some kicks require that you turn it away ,  sometimes by as much as 120 !  This must of necessity put you in a very weak defensive position and I would maintain that this is responsible for <head>losing</head> more bouts than any other factor . The kick misses ,  recovery is slow and the alert opponent has scored before you know what 's  happened .  It therefore makes sense to use kicks judiciously only when there is a clear opening and the opponent is not expecting a kick .

It is never very apparent what Freudian claims are based on ,  though they are widely accepted in our culture .

Freud is not ,  however ,  likely to be generally rejected ,  since he is so much part of the valued cultural furniture of the West .  Furthermore ,  attacks such as Crews 's  are ,  as he acknowledges ,  not taken seriously and replied to in their own terms ,  but treated as symptoms of repressed disturbance .
