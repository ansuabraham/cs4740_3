One of the major accounts of the Renaissance in Italy was published in 1860 by a Swiss history professor at Basel University .  Jacob Burckhardt sensibly avoids pedantry about a starting date ,  but stresses the revival of antiquity as a main characteristic of the period .  His book entitled The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy avoids a chronological sequence , since his <head>plan</head> of arrangement was to build up a mosaic of characteristic material . As he explained :  My starting point has to be a vision ,  otherwise I cannot do anything .  Vision I call not only optical ,  but also spiritual realization ;  for instance ,  historical vision issuing from the old sources .

A final chapter is devoted to four case studies :  Michael Erhart of Ulm ,  Tilmann Riemenschneider of Wurzburg ,  Veit Stoss of Nuremberg ,  and Hans Leinberger of Landshut .  These short studies are in part historical ,  but partly art criticism ;  the study of Leinberger is particularly relevant ,  as it comments both on an encounter with a sculpture and the problems of reading about it .  The best preliminary <head>plan</head> may be for the reader to open the book upright at ( the illustration ) and then go to the other side of the room , to be imposed on from a distance : it is the nearest the book can offer to the proper first encounter with the figure . There is no one way of looking at a sculpture by Leinberger and similarly there is no one angle or distance from which we see it anything like whole ,  but there is something like a normal sequence of approach .  This begins with the figure impinging powerfully from a distance ,  in this case as one walks into St Martin 's  at Landshut ,  more powerfully than other things in the field of view .

The presbyterians also had misgivings ,  and only came back into the system in 1838 when they were practically guaranteed control of their own schools within it .  The Church of Ireland rejoined in 1860 ,  because it lacked funds to continue its own system .  Many Roman catholic clerics were unsettled by the <head>plan</head> . The  Christian Brothers ,  founded in the early part of the century ,  withdrew from the scheme and unilaterally developed their own system .  The concern of Roman catholic clergy about the system was not without grounds .

Times change ,  however ,  and today ,  under a somewhat different corporate regime ,  Heritage starts to smack of yesterday 's  fashion ,  and one is not entirely sure what commitment remains .  Already the other Tetley Heritage Pub in York ,  The Swan ,  is out on lease to an independent retailing chain .  Moreover , the very same Tetley 's who so lovingly restored The Fox are now building , in the heart of a residential suburb not two miles away , an open - <head>plan</head> eating barn that contravenes all the accepted standards of enlightened and community - sensitive pub design . Reliance on the brewers '  better nature is a precarious sort of dependency ,  where today 's  Jekyll can be tomorrow 's  Hyde .  Our pubs are forever at risk of corporate gimmickry and catchpenny fashions .

To do otherwise is to play into the hands of the facadists and myth - makers .  Our country has more than enough pubs whose ruined interiors fail to live up to the promise of attractive historic frontages .  A number of modern pub designers attempt to rescue a sense of intimacy and defensible space by dividing these open - <head>plan</head> arenas into token drinking areas . Yet a proper compartmentalisation of pub interiors means real choice for customers .  It enhances a pub 's  ability to cater for the different and sometimes conflicting activities and tastes of different customers under the same roof ,  and in so doing it keeps alive the healthy social and age mix that is a traditional hallmark of the true pub .

Artificial plastic beams are frequently introduced ,  ceilings are stripped of plaster to reveal floor joists that were never intended to be seen ,  other timbers are artificially blackened to create a supposedly traditional though in fact inauthentic black and white effect and render or plaster is removed from walls to produce rustic charm .  At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .  In recent years serious damage to the historic interiors of pubs has resulted from the creation of the open - <head>plan</head> which now seem to be pubs ' standard internal layout . Often the creation of the open plan interior requires the removal of walls ,  chimney breasts ,  stairs and other internal features of interest ,  which is highly destructive of the building 's  historic character .  The owner of The Hollybush at Elstree proposed to infill an original coach arch in the pub 's  facade and to demolish the timber framed side walls of the passageway behind in order to form a larger and open interior ,  even though it was this feature that distinguished the building as an historic inn .

Given their prime location in the centre of towns and on major thoroughfares ,  Georgian coaching inns are frequently prime targets for refurbishment .  Such redevelopment is often unnecessary and detrimental ;  the end product of such schemes is all too often a sham - historical parody ,  re - creating an idealised ,  sanitised Britain that never actually existed .  In SAVE 's 1983 report Mike Pearce observed that many of the pubs in Winchester 's historic city centre have been modernised and remodernised to present the tourist with open - <head>plan</head> fast - food interiors modelled in the character of some mythical Merrie Englande . Nor do Georgian country pubs escape ,  either .  Many emerge from refurbishment with little of their original partitions ,  fittings or even masonry remaining .

However ,  it suggested that the October holiday should replace an existing holiday .  Angus Crichton - Miller ,  managing director of the Rank Organisation 's  holidays and hotels division and a member of the study group said :  It is not an efficient system to have such changes between busy and quiet periods and it would be better if we could flatten prices over a longer season ,  rather than have such high - peak - season prices .

As well as suggesting an autumn boost for the tourism industry ,  the group also proposed changes at the beginning of the season by introducing a fixed - date Easter holiday .

Usually these situations arise from running out of height on the circuit ,  but they can also arise from arriving back far too high and by badly planned manoeuvring in an attempt to correct that kind of position .

If they can do this , a change of <head>plan</head> at an early stage can usually prevent the situation from developing and leading to an accident . Very often during training ,  a student will be rather short of height but will just have sufficient for a normal approach .

The first indications of the new 1979 Conservative Government 's  attitude to investment became apparent when BR sought approval to build an  additional seven HST sets to cope with the first flush of growth following the launch of 125mph services on the East Coast main line the previous year .  After much haggling ,  approval was only obtained for those four out of the seven sets which could meet the much higher rate of return which would henceforth be applied to BR investment .  If BR could not make a case for seven trains for one of its most profitable routes , it was clear that <head>plans</head> for a second tranche of HSTs for the Cross Country group of services would not satisfy the new criteria . These were the circumstances which led BR to terminate HST building with a fleet of ninety - five operational trains .  It is a matter of history that as the 1980s drew to a close ,  a few extra HSTs to cope with the unprecedented levels of business by now on offer would have been very welcome .

At one stage the Birmingham New Street interchange was an integral part of the West Coast electrified service and was based on an hourly sequence of arrivals/departures from the LMR electrified area and to the North East via Sheffield .  As well as the series of long - distance trains which still run through Birmingham ,  the sub - sector now includes those few trains from the North West to Dover which run through Kensington Olympia in London ,  and the service between Manchester and Scotland via Preston and the West Coast main line .  In the late 1970s <head>plans</head> were prepared for a fleet of HSTs to operate the North East - South West ( Newcastle/Leeds - Cardiff/Plymouth ) route and these were introduced from 1982 . As already mentioned ,  many plans had to be  changed in the light of the recession and these included reduction of the number of Cross Country HSTs .  Plans to upgrade parts of Cross Country routes for higher speeds were also deferred .

The pace quickened ,  this year seeing the long - awaited introduction of the Thameslink service ,  the extension of electrification from Bournemouth to Weymouth and the delivery  ( albeit late )  of Class 442 Wessex Electrics units to give air - conditioned comfort to NSE passengers .  But 1988 ended with the disaster at Clapham discussed in the signalling chapter .  Given its success after only eighteen months , and the current <head>plans</head> to extend the Thameslink network , it now seems hard to believe that passengers have enjoyed the ability to cross London by regular electric BR services for such a short time . Success has been despite the somewhat confusing route plan initially imposed on the service south of the Thames by the necessity of incorporating the new service into an existing timetable without increasing mileage .  Thameslink was formally inaugurated by HRH The Princess Royal on 25 April ,  when she combined its formal launch with that of Save the Children Week and travelled with a number of children on unit 319036 to Crystal Palace .

Healthy business ,  and integration of the Midland main line into the HST network ,  saw most of the fixed rakes expanded to eight vehicles .  Opponents of the two locomotives for each train concept were vindicated by a series of stress defects and overheating of the Paxman Valenta 2,250hp power units ,  and it was agreed to re - engine four Western Region examples with Mirrlees units .

The reason for this is that there are now two ways of getting your council 's  blessing to proceed with the work you have in mind .  The Full Plans method is the old system that has existed for many years ,  whereby detailed plans of your proposal are submitted in duplicate ,  along with an application form .  The <head>plans</head> are examined by the council for compliance with the Building Regulations , and if everything is in order you will receive an Approval Notice in due course , which you can then file away with your deeds . The Building Notice procedure is a comparatively new system and does not require the submission of any detailed plans .  With this method a simple form  ( Notice )  is deposited with your council ,  which gives brief details of the work you want to do .

Although no detailed plans are necessary ,  you will be required to provide a location plan showing the siting of your building ,  the boundaries of the site and particulars of any drainage works .  Once a Building Notice has been submitted and accepted by your council you can start work within 48 hours .  As there are no <head>plans</head> to examine , the council is not obliged to issue any formal letter of approval . Compliance with the Building Regulations is enforced by means of site inspections during the progress of the work .  A question which is often asked is ,  Are there any risks involved in using the quicker procedure of submitting a Building Notice rather than depositing full plans ?

Mr Patten yesterday issued a draft housing planning policy guidance note ,  which will update previous documents .  The new policy will drop ,  for the first time since its introduction in the early Eighties ,  a presumption in favour of house - building at the expense of other conservation considerations .  It reiterates a growing theme in government thinking : that if the local authorities would only firmly write their own development <head>plans</head> as they are obliged to do , but which few have then environment ministers would feel obliged to honour them . Mr Ridley 's  mindedness to allow Foxley Wood depended on his view that it was a sounder way of ensuring Hampshire 's  share of new housing in the South - east than the county 's  own thinking ,  which assumed finding dozens of smaller sites .  The new decision does not let Hampshire off the hook  the county must still find room for 66,500 new homes  but it accedes to the county 's  own view that it can find the space more sensibly outside the north - east or central parts of the county .
