The actor is no different ,  although for some reason it is often thought that you are somehow ready to act ,  magically ,  the moment you enter a stage door .  Look after yourself ,  and particularly your voice and your memory ,  for without these you are dead meat .  So much of professional life is spent in the competitive <head>atmosphere</head> of interviews and auditions that a chance to work on themselves constructively and together is something actors relish . Since 1980 professional training courses have proliferated and many can be found in and around London .  All of them take the working actors '  problems into account and attempt to create classes which can make free hours both disciplined and profitable .

They merited John Ash 's  epithet old - fashioned modernism ,  and most of all Jaim Manrique 's  judgement ,  that the secret of Lorca 's  appeal  is nostalgia  :  His art does not deepen as we grow older !  he said ,  another trait the Canadian shared with the Spaniard .  His brother ,  Francisco Garia Lorca ,  has very finely defined the canciones  ,  one of the most notable poetic forms used by Lorca ,  as a lyric in which :  the poet checks his first flights in order to achieve greater purification The <head>atmosphere</head> of transcendental romantic sensibility gives way to fleeting states of mind , momentary sensations , or a disinterested humour , often imbued with a note of elegiac melancholy . Moreover ,  Lorca influenced Leonard 's  world - view too ;  his transcendental and far - reaching ideas about life touched him :  Lorca changed my way of being and thinking radically ,  he told a Spanish journalist .  His books taught me that poetry can be pure and profound ,  and at the same time popular .

Music Music must be chosen that will best give the overall and phrase rhythms to the steps , poses and gestures , that will help to create the <head>atmosphere</head> and mood of the whole and that will underline the action . Alternatively ,  the choreographer may be inspired by a piece of music and wish to bring it to life in dance  ( see page 41 )  .  There are three types of music from which to choose .

On the other hand ,  Charles Mackerras '  wonderful pot - pourri of tunes from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas for Pineapple Poll  displayed how well he has caught not only the humour but also the pathos of The Bum Boat Woman 's  Story .  Choreographers should also study John Lanchbery 's  sensitive handling of some lesser - known Chopin music for Ashton 's  A Month in the Country  and his equally successful score for Ashton 's  film ,  The Tales of Beatrix Potter  .  He based the latter on his research into Victorian and Edwardian salon music and showed what can be done by looking into such highways and byways of music when a particular period <head>atmosphere</head> is needed .

Since Fokine broke away from the rigid categories of dance or mime ,  twentieth - century choreographers ,  following his example ,  have usually created a continuous design of expressive movement which interprets the story by means of mimed dance or danced mime  ( see page 58 )  .  The stories can range from the most tragic such as The Rake 's  Progress  ,  Romeo and Juliet  and Mayerling  to the lyrical fantasy of The Dream  and from the subtle and poignant A Month in the Country  to the happily funny La Fille Mal Garde  or the rumbustious Pineapple Poll  .  But no matter whether the ballet lasts one , two or three acts the choreographer must be fully in control of his material so that every detail of the characterisation of the whole cast is appropriate to the general <head>atmosphere</head> and environment within which the plot unfolds . This is particularly important in a three - act ballet where any temptation to display dance for its own sake can lead to the introduction of divertissements  merely to fill in time or show off all the dancers in the company ,  but is not concerned with the unfolding of the story .  Petipa was often accused of doing this ,  the best example being the dances by characters from other fairy tales who come to Aurora 's  wedding  (  The Sleeping Beauty  .  )

Can certain individuals be directed in such a way that they stand out from the mass because they are the tellers of the story ,  the chief exponents in the drama or theme ?

Or must they remain part of the mass , in other words the corps de ballet , because they are needed to create the proper <head>atmosphere</head> , state the location , suggest the mood and very often respond to whatever is taking place ?

The heroines of such ballets go hunting ,  practise archery ,  play lutes or mandolins ,  dance appropriate period dances and generally behave as to the manner born in aristocratic surroundings .  They arrive on stage in strict order of precedence ,  the noblest usually arriving last so that the lesser characters can look on in suitable admiration ,  whilst the servants  ( the corps de ballet  )  keep their distance .  This acceptance of the usual forms of court etiquette was first developed in a particular social environment , and it is important to comply with it if a proper <head>atmosphere</head> is to be established for the action which is to take place .

Her role has the same sobering effect on the <head>atmosphere</head> of the ballet as that of Bratfisch , the Count 's valet , in Mayerling . Harlequin ,  in his earlier embodiment as Hermes ,  was the god of animals and this idea has been another valuable source of choreographic material .

He realised ,  as did later choreographers ,  that the steps and patterns of such material had to be properly displayed to the audience ,  not just danced for themselves .  In other words he opened up the circles ,  squares and longways sets to show what gave rhythm and life to the movements .  It is this opening up and exposure of traditional dance that is so important when choreographers attempt to give a realistic <head>atmosphere</head> to the style and expression of their work . They should remember that they are suggesting and not giving the actual location .  In real life the onlookers are part of the activity and usually join in .

Everything is open to interpretation ,  usually by the police ,  and the poor ,  hard - pressed licensee and his customers are so confused that the usual solution is to avoid the problem and not let children into the pub at all .  While we must support family rooms in those pubs which have the space and can provide suitable amusement for the little angels ,  this cannot remain the only answer to the problem .  Family rooms are useful to let the less well - behaved and noisier children run riot but they are frequently cold and characterless and , no matter how good the facilities may be , you often feel excluded from the main <head>atmosphere</head> of the pub . I WOULD rather take my children into the main bar or lounge of a pub and expect them to sit sensibly and reasonably quietly so that we can all relax ,  drink ,  talk and eat in a proper pub atmosphere .  What is needed is a relaxation of the law as it now stands to allow the controlled admission of children to certain pubs at certain times of day .

After all ,  the situation bulges with seedy potential :  a man about to have sex with a girl young enough to be his daughter is suddenly forced to pose as her father .  Farce likes to tinker with such taboos .

The job demands intense concentration ;  even with six pairs of hands grabbing ,  the flow is almost too fast to be dealt with precisely .

In the old days it needed a team of 20 women to do the equivalent job  and even then they did it less than half as fast .  Couldn't get em now ,  says the farmer 's  wife scornfully .

The salon was continued during daylight hours at the ICM building in an <head>atmosphere</head> which succeeded in being simultaneously both frenetic and relaxed and in which a mood of party time was seldom absent . While Milton grappled with two telephones hung from a sort of yoke around his neck and into which he alternately spoke in a staccato mixture of best Variety showbiz - patter ,  friends ,  clients and droppers - in gathered to laugh and gossip in his office while Milton imperviously went on with his wheeling and dealing .

Webern 's  Six Orchestral Pieces ,  still perceptibly Romantic even with the pruned wind band of 1928 ,  emerged under Simon Rattle with enormous personality .

The brutal clarity which the acoustic bestowed on Ravel 's Sheherazade stripped the work of <head>atmosphere</head> . There was lots of marvellous playing with sensitive string sound and excellent wind solos ,  but the whole was too clear an image of Ravel 's  subtle settings .

But a fault in the computer controlling one of the engines has forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  ( Nasa )  to delay the launch until at least Monday .

Critics argue that if the probe should explode on lift - off or veer off course and re - enter Earth 's <head>atmosphere</head> , the batteries could be pulverised , dispersing 260,000 curies of radioactive waste more than half as much as has been released in all nuclear tests .

Nasa won the first round of the legal battle on Tuesday ,  when a federal judge refused to order the launch be postponed .

This noble idea was all very well in the relatively lax <head>atmosphere</head> and control of early NEP , with only one unique educational experiment involved . Yet even at this time many members of industrial trade unions realized fully that they were no longer free agents in a wider collective ,  but increasingly regimented subjects of the Party. The aim of creating a sense of prime loyalty among members of the colony ,  which was small enough for them to know each other ,  did not constitute any kind of a threat to central authorities in 1922 ,  but it would not have been tolerated in the 1930s ,  when family members were encouraged to spy on one another in the state interest .

A new - build scheme providing equivalent accommodation would be exempt from this tax .  Only if a building is listed can this significant premium on construction costs be avoided ,  although the majority of disused churches which are offered for conversion are of listed status .

This mood might question the suitability of making the radical alterations to the aisle roof and the almost equally severe remodelling of the south slope of the nave roof which were implemented here  ( Plates 24 and 25 )  .  Although it is clear that these changes were made in order to admit light to the new ,  deep - plan living accommodation ,  it is conceivable that the judicious use of ranges of standard reversible and ventilating roof windows might have provided an answer to this requirement which would have been less erosive of the original external appearance .

The emphasis is on reflection .  In the new jazz climate ,  the anonymity of Peter King ,  one of the unsung great British saxophonists ,  has lifted a little  partly because one of his admirers is Ben Watt of Everything But The Girl ,  who is also the producer of Crusade .  Given that background , the album is unsurprisingly pop - influenced , with a velvety studio <head>atmosphere</head> , tunes by Smokey Robinson , Donny Hathaway and Joni Mitchell , even a funk version of Blue Monk . It all represents King a little too effectively marketed to tingle the skin ,  but underneath it all there is the same fluidity ,  the same lightning double - time runs ,  the same sense of shape ,  declaring that repackaging cannot really cramp his style .  The opposite extreme is represented by the Russian saxophonist ,  Vladimir Chekasin ,  sometime member of the Ganelin Trio ,  caught here live on the Munster Jazz Festival .

Moscow sets terms for unity debate Following are extracts from an address to members of the European Parliament given yesterday by the Soviet Foreign Minister ,  Mr Eduard Shevardnadze .  ONE of the principal components of the German question ,  and of the entire European situation ,  is the recognition of the fact that the question of European borders has been solved in a definitive and irrevocable manner .

For were not the brothels and whorehouses of Panama City and pre - revolutionary Havana developed for the most part for the benefit of American troops ?  Other people 's  nationalism is never easy to fathom ,  but Panama 's  is more than usually overlaid with issues of race  ( white and black )  and class  ( rich and poor )  .  In the poorer neighbourhoods , the <head>atmosphere</head> of suppressed rage is sometimes palpable . The Americans used to be so arrogant that they refused even to allow the Panamanian flag to fly .  ( The national currency today is still the US dollar .  )

NEXT time Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra perform Messiaen 's  Et Exspecto Resurrectionem Mortuorum they should do it in a great cathedral .  Not a modest one like St Asaph ,  where the gong and tam - tam crescendos of the third movement would be damagingly deafening ,  but in some vast Gothic building where the acoustic reverberations would be as effective as the spiritual associations in enhancing the effect of the piece .  In a place with an acoustic as dry and an <head>atmosphere</head> as worldly as Birmingham Town Hall it does n't work . Indeed ,  without the ecclesiastical aura ,  the passages of massively slow - moving melody ,  unadorned and sometimes unharmonised ,  can sound too plain and even too thin in texture .  The birdsong episodes in the third and fourth movements ,  projected in brilliant colours and vital rhythms on this occasion ,  can only benefit from concert - hall clarity ,  it is true .
