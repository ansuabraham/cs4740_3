Her course teacher has given her a reading list ,  and the library staff are good at helping students with all sorts of interests .  As part of the course ,  she has to choose a subject of her own about which to write a paper ;  one of her difficulties is to know how to form her own views ,  not just copy already received opinions .  She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ; it seems that she may have chosen the wrong <head>sort</head> of topic , since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome , and although there were plenty of books about it , many of them went into extravagant detail . Happily her supervisor has guided more than one student through topics about Michelangelo ,  and has a route map prepared ,  including introductory and background books ,  but also passages from longer scholarly works .  If the two girls compare notes one day ,  the New Yorker will complain about the useless articles she read ;  the newspaper articles were almost always short ,  written maybe by hard - pressed critics who were only allowed short articles ,  further cut down by sub - editors .

No interesting touch or invention of form escaped his eye .  He was equally at home in the Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art ,  keen in discerning what was good in the arts of many ages and styles .  As for working art critics , their newspapers need reviews of every <head>sort</head> of exhibition , whether modern or historical . Even though critics may not be as learned as their art - historical colleagues ,  there is no good reason for their practised eyes to cloud over when looking at art of other periods .  Furthermore ,  artists who are also critics are especially likely to make vivid comments on the methods and techniques of old art .

The critical promoter of the work of Seurat and his friends was Flix Fnon ,  a subtle stylist who varied his methods according to the work he was describing ;  he used expository language for Degas ,  but he dropped logical connection in language ,  even verbs when discussing Monet 's  spontaneous art .  In arguing for pointillism ,  he quoted the scientific treatises consulted by Seurat and even printed mathematical equations .  Fnon possessed a dry wit , honed to a sharp edge by journalism ; he was a specialist in the <head>sort</head> of notes usually titled as News in brief , but in France called faits divers ( Sundry facts ) . He made these three - liners into sardonic comments which undercut the banalities of the newspaper in which they appeared .  As a critic ,  his descriptions of paintings were phrased with exceptional care.

He asked questions ,  and between his questions and the painter 's  answers ,  there was a discovery of the painting itself .  Even more , there was a <head>sort</head> of mimesis between Fnon and the artist . A friend to artists in England after the war in which Apollinaire had fought was another combatant ,  the poet and critic Herbert Read .  In 1933 Read published an even - handed book called Art Now  ,  eclectic in its selection ,  with discussions of Expressionism ,  Abstraction and Surrealism .

He described this aesthetic response as the bed - rock of conservative criticism .  For him ,  critical writing has to take up wider issues than enjoyment of a picture or a sculpture .  A different <head>sort</head> of response to art is to use it as a means of learning more about the society in which it was produced ; this may be felt by a theoretician to be more important than to know the artist 's intentions , which , it can be argued , are determined by society . Or ,  the effect of a painting may be compared with those of other means of communication ,  such as photography ,  film or television .  there is every reason to welcome such studies ,  though a reader hoping for judgements about quality may be disappointed by a theoretical writer 's  greater stress on interpretation .

Formal differences in art have been linked to places in varied ways ,  one of the best - known Renaissance contrasts being the stress on line  evident in Florentine art as against the colourist approach of the Venetians ,  a city on water .  Does an English liking for watercolour spring from the country 's  climate ?  Does the flat landscape of the Netherlands impose a special <head>sort</head> of vision on Dutch artists ? The reverse of the coin is internationalism ,  a feature ,  some might say ,  of twentieth - century art ;  not so uncommon either in other periods ,  where art historians struggle heroically to identify differences between the art of one country and another .  Some of these struggles have been inspired by base motives  desires to appropriate art to a national or a political cause .

Similar treatment can be found in works on great monuments and schemes ,  perhaps especially in the Italian Renaissance ,  when such projects as the Sistine Chapel or Tintoretto 's  Scuola di San Rocco achieved a personal artistic unity of the highest standard .  for art historians ,  incomplete schemes or dismembered works such as altarpieces have the attraction of needing detective work ;  but a critic takes an interest in a reconstruction only if it throws new light on surviving art .  The main strength of this <head>sort</head> of monograph is its potential for detailed interpretation . As a book on a single subject ,  there is a good chance that the need for description will be reduced by extensive illustration ,  while a favourable judgement on the work has already been implied by the choice of the subject for a monograph .  The interpretation of imagery ,  the circumstances of production ,  the place of the work in the artist 's  career ,  the historical context ,  the precise information about the work 's  appearance and condition ,  these are things that can be fully discussed in a monograph .

According to this the picture must have been painted about 1588 ,  with which the style and the age of the sitter agree. From a letter to Francesco Gonzaga ,  written in 1622 and published by A. Luzio ,  in which among others a self - portrait of Tintoretto is offered to him ,  Pittalunga argues that the Paris picture may have been the one mentioned and which formed part of Rubens 's  estate .  This <head>sort</head> of reading is only for the dedicated follower of the history of taste , though any reader particularly interested in a picture may find within a single catalogue entry an acutely discriminating judgement or interesting facts ; for example , Tietze 's entry also points out that Manet so much admired the Tintoretto self - portrait that he made a copy of it . The catalogue raisonn continues to be a key document for authentication of an artist 's  work .  As the decades have gone by ,  scholarly work has piled up ,  so that this category of book has taken a larger ,  longer and much more expensive form than before .

The persuasive tax advantages for the rich to contribute works of art to public collections also play a part ,  contributing a measure of prestige shared between artists and the powerful in society .  Critics can also be invested with a degree of respect deriving partly from their academic connections .  Another <head>sort</head> of authority derives from money , which a reader of art criticism may find it difficult to dissociate from an object . Historical knowledge is the surest cure for this damaged intellectual condition ,  as the history of taste will show many examples of the irrelevance of monetary value to artistic quality .  Incidentally ,  the good art critic should be the reader 's  friend in refusing to be impressed by art market prices .

To suggest ,  as I do ,  that Georges Braque is the greatest living painter is to remind a contemporary audience ,  fed to satiety on brilliant innovation ,  frenzied novelty and every sort of spontaneous expression ,  that ,  after all ,  permanence ,  grandeur ,  deliberation ,  lucidity and calm are paramount virtues of the art of painting The rival genius of Picasso has proved to the world that our age may be epitomized by works which  ( show )  his unfailing sense of visual drama ,  his protean invention and his power of investing his creations with a hallucinatory poetry .  Heron shows in his article a deep sympathy with Braque 's work , which , incidentally , was a <head>sort</head> of painting he himself was seeking to practise at the time . He argued that Braque enhanced objects :  He is infinitely kind to all the things that go into his pictures .

How then is the reader of art criticism best advised to use criticism to follow the fortunes of artists ?  One policy is to try to see more than one review of any exhibition .  The notice board at a show where notices are pinned up will give the general idea of what <head>sort</head> of reviews have been written . It is a usual feature of such a comparison that there is a basic level of information which is common to most of the reviews ,  and it is the mark of a skilful critic to have worked in some personal assessment of works ,  or some individual response to the show as a whole .  The data common to all reviews can be discounted as being neither criticism nor evaluation .

Pechorin is a cold - hearted ,  stylish fatalist ,  experimentalist ,  existentialist and divided man ,  a traveller ,  gambler ,  heart - breaker and forgetter of old friends ,  who loves to ride a spirited horse through the long grass against a desert wind .

Amis also likes to write , as Larkin liked to write , about the fear of death , and it may be that this fear can be detected in the failure to notice here that both <head>sorts</head> of people are subject to it , as to other unavoidable misfortunes , and that both sorts die .

The second sentence of the issue of May 1988 refers to the first twenty years of the state :  Threatening to push the Jews into the sea ,  the Arab world reformulated the Nazi theory of Lebensraum  in Mediterranean terms :  there was no room in the region for a Jewish homeland .  Arabs who had been expelled from their land and thrust into the condition of Jewish refugees are hereby reformulated as imperialist aggressors and as Nazis .  This is reminiscent of the <head>sort</head> of inversion a fault - finding literary criticism can produce which is not to deny , which is indeed to admit , that the Arab leaders and polemicists of the region have had their faults , including some of those which have been identified over the years by Commentary .

George Schultz travelled to the Middle East in the summer of 1988 to spread the word that the continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the frustration of Palestinian rights is a dead - end street .

Drama school productions are staged with an awareness of the kind of demands the profession will make ,  and students are naturally anxious to be seen in the final production by people who 're likely to offer them work .  Unfortunately ,  it is often difficult to get agents to attend these productions .  Most drama schools final productions are staged over a similar <head>sort</head> of schedule , which means agents are asked to see students ' work over a fairly compressed period . Agents are notified of performances by the schools ,  and they also receive hundreds of letters from students inviting them to see particular performances .  Remember ,  though ,  that badgering agents is quite useless ;  if they want to come they will come ,  but telephoning them and overselling yourself can be just as useless as not letting them know that you 're alive and working .

Jewish education is understood in three phases : primarily in the home , which is regarded as a <head>sort</head> of mini - temple , so strongly are the emphases and traditions posited there ; at school , in the normal way , as with all growing children ; and at Hebrew school , which is attached to the synagogue under the rabbi or the teachers appointed by him. Leonard 's  ears ,  from his earliest moments ,  were conditioned to hear not only his mother talking but also singing in her lovely ,  deep alto voice the Yiddish lullabies she had known since her own childhood .  By this time she had been away from her native Russia scarcely a dozen years .

The scepticism follows because if we are confined in experience to the contents of our own minds alone ,  it would seem to be impossible that we should ever come to know anything about  or even come intelligibly to think about  things outside our own minds .  The programme of many modern philosophers ,  therefore ,  has been to develop a conception of man and his mind which either disposes of or downgrades the inner ,  private arena ,  making the function of mind essentially a part of the public and physical world .  Once this is achieved and this , it is held , can be done by some <head>sort</head> of physicalist theory of mind with strong behaviourist elements then most of the insoluble problems of early modern philosophy disappear . I want to defend a radically different picture ,  which takes a much  broader historical perspective .  This alternative picture involves denying that there is a coherent materialist alternative to the Cartesian private theatre view of the mind ;  but it also involves placing the attack on the Cartesian picture in a wider context .

From the point of view of the experiencing subject ,  the meaningfulness is not something of which he is conscious ;  all he experiences is ,  first the word red ,  then a mental image :  there is nothing that could count as his internally and introspectably associating them which does not reintroduce the mysterious generality of thought .  It does not help the associationist to press the concept of resemblance to his aid .  It might seem that it would , because it might seem very natural to think that one red thing or image might be taken as standing for red things in general because of its natural resemblance to the other members of the class , this constituting the most fundamental <head>sort</head> of association . But resemblance cannot explain how a thinker could experience one object as standing for another ;  for how could the fact that a particular  datum is similar to other things mean anything to a thinker unless he experienced it as  being like many others  that is ,  unless he grasped it ,  not just as a particular but as  an instance of a kind ?  But this is the very ability for which we are trying to account .

So a materialist theory of the mind is false .  The most primitive physicalist response to this argument is to  deny the claim that there is anything about the mind that BS does not know .  All that BS lacks is an ability to respond directly to stimuli of certain <head>sorts</head> : V knows no more than BS , he can simply do something BS cannot . BS is like a man who knows all about swimming ,  even to the point of being able to train the Olympic team ,  but who cannot swim himself ,  and V is the man with the normal talent for swimming .  I think that it would be true to say that ,  nowadays ,  most materialists want to avoid theories that are as nakedly behaviouristic as this ,  and want to accommodate the common - sense intuition that something inner and introspectible is missing in the blind or deaf ,  for example ,  in addition to their lost capacity to respond .

It is the content specifically of sense - perception that must be taken non - reductively ,  if the contrast required by our concept of disposition is to be maintained .  Some philosophers might suspect that I have not considered the behaviouristic theories in their most sophisticated form .  Would it not make a difference if one identified experience , not with some disposition to overt behaviour , but with the behaviour of the brain as it discriminates the various <head>sorts</head> of stimuli within the nervous system ? This is a version of the supposedly post   - behaviourist theory called functionalism ,  which treats mental states as responding to other internal and mental states as well as to external stimuli .  The first thing to notice about functionalism is that it does not fare any better than behaviourism in providing an account of what it is that V knows and BS does not ,  for BS could know all about V 's  functional or covertly behavioural states ;  so there is no lack of knowledge that his deficit could consist in .

What Peter had damaged ,  and what one might hope to restore ,  was the natural soil - based unity of Russia .

The truth is ,  not all exciting stories are properly thrillers .  Being gripped by a narrative is an altogether wider notion than what is presaged by the two - in - one of being outside yet inside Raskolnikov 's  strange smile :  the rehearsal of the murder ,  the murder sequence itself ,  the three long duels with the detective Porfiry ,  the suffering ,  the hesitation ,  the final climb up the police - station stairs .  Dostoevsky 's own attempt to suggest how he disposes his reader in relation to these events goes as follows : Narration by the author , a <head>sort</head> of invisible but omniscient being who nevertheless does n't leave him meaning his hero ' for a moment So ,  after appearing to settle for third - person narrative ,  he doubles back on himself and leaves us to make what we can of an omniscient author who is bound hand and foot to a far from omniscient protagonist .  That he succeeds in having it both ways is our experience of reading his novel in its dominant and thriller aspect .

The real problem is that the writers of such texts may make political difficulties within a department ,  or teach in ways difficult for students to understand .  Again ,  English departments can be unhelpful about participating in schemes for training academics how to teach ,  claiming that teaching literature is less easily defined and methodologized than teaching engineering or economics .  At a time when a good public image is essential for universities , English is unable to explain itself in ways immediately intelligible to the outsider , is notoriously riven with doubts and disagreements that prevent it from having a shared sense of purpose , and may at intervals erupt into crises that attract the wrong <head>sort</head> of publicity .

Hatred of Jews is something that the Fascist is especially prone to ,  but it is n't a necessary consequence of his Fascism ,  and in any case it 's  only a symptom ,  certainly not the root cause of his disease .

What we gain from this is obvious :  our own consciences are clear ,  and we 're no longer implicated .

and fall into those flowers and sink into the marsh near them .

Certainly the deliberate navet here is not in the least false ,  but has the limpid directness of some of the Chinese poems that Pound had marvellously transfigured in Cathay   ( 1915 )  .

Certainly the aspiration is not limited in modern times to those who have read Emaux et Cames  ,  the French book that Pound respectfully pillaged for Hugh Selwyn Mauberley  ;  it is to be found in all modern poetries known to me ,  Russian and Polish as well as French ,  and  ( more faintly )  in British and American .  In short ,  what this has to do with modern poetry is very clear ;  what it has to do with modern criticism is not clear at all ,  since that criticism has ,  as we have seen ,  no vocabulary for dealing with it ,  and moves further and further from finding such a vocabulary ,  the more it takes its lead from linguisticians like Saussure and Jakobson .

This is hardly the <head>sort</head> of catchy title guaranteed to get most of us rushing to our desks in search of pen and paper , nor is it easy to imagine squeezing into packed village halls to listen to speeches demanding a rewrite of the rules on deferred taxation . In acknowledgement of this ,  IASC ,  which comprises the leading world accounting bodies ,  sent out a separate invitation to interested parties asking for their views on the subject .  It called this :  Towards the International Harmonisation of Financial Statements .

The prospect of Arthur Scargill entering Parliament invites mild derision rather than anxiety in the suburbs .  Potential Labour voters are coming to accept that an increasingly confident  ( but mercifully less cocky )  Neil Kinnock has rumbled the fundamentalists too ,  and is neither impressed nor cowed by them .  In his pre - conference interview this weekend the Labour leader demonstrated a restrained confidence and authority which is new and , if it can be maintained in the heat of battle , likely to prove appealing to the <head>sort</head> of people whose votes he must win . Even so there remain causes for concern in the Labour camp .  Yesterday ,  Labour 's  leader dismissed both electoral reform and pacts .

Mrs Mandela has been shuttling back and forth with messages from her husband 's  prison home near Cape Town .  The tribal leaders who visited Mr Mandela have also met the top ANC leaders in Zambia .  The upshot of it all is that Major - General Holomisa has made Transkei a haven of <head>sorts</head> , a thorn in Pretoria 's side , for the ANC . He will no doubt tread very carefully ,  but the consequences of his stand could be far - reaching .  He said yesterday that he meant to conduct a referendum to test whether Transkei 's  three million people wished to retain independence or not.

Those are the real dangers in our society today .  I sense they are both increasing .  The successful are always tempted to regard their success as a <head>sort</head> of blessing or reward for righteousness . This can lead to judgements being made about the unsuccessful ,  the unemployed ,  the poor and the unintelligent which are both uncharitable and untrue .  I 'm thinking of the sort of attitude that suggests the unemployed do too little to help themselves ,  that if only you have determination and drive you can get on in the world .

Yet the Chelsea manager ,  Bobby Campbell ,  and Arsenal assistant ,  Theo Foley ,  agreed it had been a good match ,  and the spectators '  complaints were muted .  Some even applauded the players at the end .  It takes all <head>sorts</head> . Bobby Robson was there to assess World Cup candidates ,  but nothing positive emerged from 90 minutes of scuffling that made one almost yearn for the more measured boredom of Rangers '  European Cup exit in Munich three days earlier .  At least the outcome was appropriate .

Hong Kong companies are not well - known moralists :  their main interest lies in staunching their own losses of trained workers ,  and preserving the machinery of government .  To answer that immediate need ,  the British government has been agonising over how to offer a single tranche of passports ,  perhaps 100,000 ,  to Hong Kong ,  in such a way as to target recipients whom it believes play vital roles in the public and private sector .  It had originally hoped to make some <head>sort</head> of announcement last month ; but the practical complications have proved immense . How could the right people be identified ?  How could they be tied to Hong Kong as a condition of receipt ?

We are getting away from the labour party for industrial workers ,  says Walter Momper ,  the SPD mayor of Berlin and one of the new generation of leaders .  We are strong now on women 's  rights ,  the environment and disarmament .  This <head>sort</head> of language dismays the traditional ranks of SPD supporters , especially the big trade unions , who fear their voice within the party is being muffled . It has not always been easy for those working class voters who see the Greens as an undisciplined bunch ,  inimical to the interests of industrial society ,  to keep up with the SPD 's  enthusiastic appetite for environmental matters .  There has been a noticeable shift of working class support from the SPD to the far - right Republicans  not as much as the losses from the Christian Democrats ,  but enough to worry party managers .

He did not actually handle or take possession of any documents ,  and is unable to substantiate the detail or authenticity of papers of which he had some sight .  The existence of Inner Circle was immediately questioned by loyalists .  Peter Robinson , a Democratic Unionist MP , said people were sceptical of the idea of rogue cops going around to take out IRA terrorists it 's the <head>sort</head> of stuff you might expect to see on television with Clint Eastwood . Nonetheless ,  the fact that there have been up to a score of document leaks in the past month means the report is being given widespread credence .  Seamus Mallon ,  an SDLP MP ,  said if the report was true it was a direct challenge from within the police to the authority of the Chief Constable and the Government .

First ,  the work is dramaturgically polite ;  it consults its audience too much to be taken seriously as drop - out theatre .  And secondly ,  its music is too operatic  too Brittenesque  to excite us searching spirits who trek through gaslit suburbs in quest of aesthetic deprivation .  Like the artists in La Boheme , Aggie and Sprugg Deverell 's two winos - spend a good deal of time play - acting , in an operative <head>sort</head> of way . Sometimes they speak ,  sometimes they break into song .  They tell each other stories  ( Sprugg is a poet ,  like Rodolfo )  ;  they flirt harmlessly ,  get quietly drunk ,  but they do n't swear and they do n't you - know - what  it 's  a family show ,  in fact ,  though any child would faint with boredom .

In 1964 ,  it was proverbially the white - coated technicians of ICI Billingham in Cleveland who typified the swing to Labour and the Wilsonian scientific revolution .  Mr Kinnock took a leaf from Harold Wilson 's  book  and coined a goodish phrase  when he declared that education and training are now the commanding heights of the economy .  That is the <head>sort</head> of talk which must find a response in a country in which acute labour shortage coexists with unconscionably high unemployment . Foreign affairs are not often an important factor in British general elections .  But the rapid and dramatic changes which are taking place in the world today ,  changes of a hopeful and not a frightening kind ,  could help to make a long - serving government more vulnerable to the time - for - a - change mentality .

The French team have been together since Sunday  and even that was not enough for Fouroux .  He wanted them to gather last Friday and be absented from their weekend round of Championship matches ,  but even Albert Ferrasse ,  the autocratic French Federation president ,  would not stand for that .  In fact it worked out well for Fouroux , since most of his players ran into the <head>sort</head> of form which , if reproduced tonight , will make the Home Union 's players wish they were just that at home . Philippe Sella ,  for instance ,  scored three tries for Agen against Ussel ,  and his co - centre Marc Andrieu two for Nimes against Lavelanet .  Unfortunately for the Lions ,  as the French persist in calling them ,  they will have had nothing like the preparation time of their opponents .
