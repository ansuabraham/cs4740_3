Watching the cuisinires during the early stages ,  there was no obvious clue as to why anyone should find it necessary to draw a theoretical distinction between male and female chefs .  One woman was handier with a knife ,  another was better organised ,  two had marvellous raw materials ,  another was feeling the pressure of competing .  At least an hour before the cooks submitted their offerings to be judged , it was clear who was going to <head>win</head> . Reine Sammut of La Fenire ,  a de luxe bistrot in the Vauclusian hill - town of Lourmarin ,  had the edge .

A successful team may have to go through a number of fights during the course of a day 's  competition so it is not at all unusual to see teams short - handed through injury in the final stages .  Never be tempted to forfeit the last two bouts of a male team match ,  or the last bout of a female team match if you have already seen your team take the deciding first three/two victories .  Although the opposing team has no chance of <head>winning</head> , any attempt to withdraw your remaining team - member ( s ) may well be rewarded by disqualification of the entire team for bad sportsmanship . Sometimes an event is at first delayed but then things happen fast .  Should this occur ,  a team which is relaxing may find itself out of earshot when their name is called .

The training environment for this must always be an 8m x 8m  ( 9.5yd x 9.5 yd )  area ,  and you should practise until you are sure of your position within it at any given time .

To do so is to help the opponent to <head>win</head> without his having to hit you with a single scoring technique .

Our game really is in danger of dying from too much of it .  You cannot blame a brilliant young player who takes ,  say ,  the 200,000 he or she is offered ,  to play just for one night but it inevitably gives them a  totally false impression of life and what their tennis priorities ought to be .  But when you have a situation where youngsters of 12 or 13 and in some cases even younger who may only have <head>won</head> a couple of matches , are being offered 500,000 guarantees to sign up with one of the management companies before they are snapped up by one of the rival agents , the potential for long term damage is enormous . This year ,  in prize money alone ,  there is well over 100m available for professional players round the world ,  including team events such as The David Cup and The Federation Cup .  And that is before you start taking into consideration commercial endorsements and appearance money which ,  at a conservative guess must add at least another 3040m .

First ,  Steffi admitted The women 's  event does n't really start before the second week after most of the top seeds had advanced for no more than the loss of a few games .  Then Monica , in apparently wanting the ITF to change the Olympic eligibility rules to suit top players who did not want to qualify by playing in the Federation Cup , said without Gabriela , Martina or I in the Olympics , they would n't really be the Olympics and Steffi could <head>win</head> the gold medal playing left - handed .

All these transactions could be declared ultra vires ,  beyond the legal powers of local authorities and therefore invalid ,  if Hammersmith loses .

But , if Hammersmith <head>wins</head> and the deals are declared legal , the council will have to pay the losses on the transactions . These have mounted because in February Nicholas Ridley ,  then Secretary of State for the Environment ,  stopped any new deals and Hammersmith 's  portfolio was largely weighted to the expectation that interest rates would be low ,  preventing the council from improving its position in the market .  The council had wound down its holdings from 5bn to 2bn but its advisers had backed the wrong horse by predicting low interest rates .
