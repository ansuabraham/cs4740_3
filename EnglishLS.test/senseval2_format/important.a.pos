Cliff said ,  I am pleased to support ACET in the world they are doing .  The care of people in the community ,  with are ill with HIV infection and AIDS ,  together with the education of schoolchildren to help prevent the spread of this terrible disease is becoming more and more urgent .  I believe it is especially <head>important</head> that ACET represents the Church working in the front line to provide real and practical support . So often Christians are criticised for not getting involved .   Cliff with Dr Patrick Dixon ,  Director of ACET

Those at home often need opiates  ( morphine - like medicines )  for pain ,  while one in five will also need a special battery - operated syringe pump ,  especially if they are too weak to swallow .  Specialist care The picture then has changed and we now need to plan for increasing numbers of those with chronic illnesses needing specialist community care not just volunteers , although volunteers continue to have a vitally <head>important</head> role to play . Until the numbers of deaths each month has risen to equal or exceed the number of new diagnoses ,  the numbers needing care will continue to rise fast ,  even if the number of new cases reported in official figures is relatively constant or falling .  These factors help explain some of the reasons why the total number of ACET clients covered at any one time by our on call service in London has more than doubled from 70 in April 1990 to over 150 by March 1991 ;  and why the nature of the services required has become so much more sophisticated .

This aid money  worth US1 billion per annum  is crucial to the fulfilment of the government 's  economic policies .  There have been some events which give qualified cause for optimism .  Perhaps most <head>important</head> is the development of a Mothers Front to campaign for investigations into the mass disappearances . Modelled on similar organizations  in Argentina and Central America ,  it consists mainly of mothers whose husbands ,  sons and daughters have disappeared or are known to have been murdered by the government or the JVP .  Although headed by opposition MPs ,  it has grown independently on a national basis and held its first large scale rally in Colombo in late February 1991 .

Venturi 's  survey started with classical times ,  the uncertainties of writing by Xenocrates ,  lists of lost works such as the treatise by Apelles ,  and settled down to comment on  two fundamental categories of criticism ,  the lives of artists ,  and the critic 's  encounter with the work of art .  For the latter he quoted a sentence by Lucian ,  the second - century Greek rhetorician :  A work of art requires an intelligent spectator who must go beyond the pleasure of the eyes to express a judgement and to argue the reasons for what he sees .  For Venturi , an <head>important</head> development in art criticism came in the eighteenth century which saw the foundation of aesthetics and the rise of philosophies for which art was an indispensable ingredient . Writing as he was in the 1930s ,  he expressed his pleasure at the extensive documentation and reference material available to the student of art ,  instancing the growth of libraries and art historical teaching .  If he were alive today ,  he would have even more cause for satisfaction .

He earned this disputable title by his thoughtful approach to critical issues and the undeniable distinction of his critical practice .  His writings on art include several reviews of the Paris Salons ,  which were either published in booklets or in journals such as the Revue franaise  .  The custom of writing about the Salons was well established , and had inspired brilliant writing by such an <head>important</head> figure in the eighteenth century as Diderot . By the 1850s the tradition had declined ,  so that Baudelaire was seeking to give new life to a decayed literary genre .  He asserted that a modern artist should be in tune with his times ,  careful to avoid hackneyed subjects .

Of the latter he wrote ,  Lucas van Leyden is an artist of frailer calibre than Drer ,  and prone to lose himself in imitation of stronger men ,  each of his contemporaries in turn dominating his style .  Another book about the age of Drer ,  but on a different topic ,  is The Limewood Sculptors of Renaissance Germany  ,  by Michael Baxandall ,  published in 1980 .  The author started his career in the Victoria and Albert Museum , where there is an <head>important</head> group of this sculpture ; his book had a double origin in a museum exhibition and a series of lectures . Divisions in the book are unusually clear ,  separate chapters being given to topics such as function ,  the market ,  or the historical and political background of the subject .  He makes a particular point of technique .

One view of the art market is that it is like a staircase with several landings .  Only dealers sell on the steps ,  while private owners prefer the more certain floor of a landing of clearly established prices for a category of work .  Correct descriptions are <head>important</head> to auctioneers , as can be exemplified by the coding used to list paintings . This is the system used by Sothebys :  ( a )  references to signatures ,  inscription and dates refer to the present state of the work ;    ( b )  the term bears a signature and/or date and/or inscription means that in our opinion the artist 's  name and/or date and/or inscription have been added by another hand ;   ( c )  the term signed and/or dated and/or inscribed means that in our opinion the signature and/or date and/or inscription are from the hand of the artist .

What Wolfe provides is art criticism in a sardonic mode ,  created by parodying others .  One of Wolfe 's  targets is the critic Greenberg ,  about whom an apologist has gravely asserted :  The significance of Clement Greenberg cannot be overestimated .  He is the designer and subtle manipulator of modernism , which is the single most <head>important</head> and influential theory of modern art . Greenberg wrote exhibition reviews for The Nation  during the 1940s ,  but his lasting reputation comes from a collection of his articles ,  including some more thematic pieces for Partisan Review  ,  in a book published in 1961 with the title Art and Culture  .  Greenberg 's  name has a special glamour because of his successful advocacy of Abstract Expressionist artists against the dominance of the School of Paris ,  as Barbara Reise wrote .

Cultural history and theory ,  it has to be said ,  have very extensive agenda ,  and art criticism is perhaps only a sub - paragraph under a secondary heading .  The reader may be doomed to disappointment in reading through an article with wide contextual terms of reference if looking for something as simple as descriptions of works of art ,  their interpretation and evaluation .  Articles of synthesis between art and other subjects may include <head>important</head> art criticism . Literary theory is at present in demand as a point of reference for writing on the visual arts .  Articles on this sort of theme may appear in art periodicals ,  but are just as likely to be found in other  journals ,  on literature ,  say ,  or history .

But to love someone meant to fly ,  to rise above the earth yourself .  So high that you could see everything .  Even if the world looked different from that height , even if it looked changed , even if what on the ground seemed <head>important</head> was transformed into insignificance . She 'd say ,  moreover ,  that you could always get out of a boat and go ashore ,  but from that height you could only crash .  The blessed piece of earth over which float these balloons ,  over which are poised these acrobats ,  is a corner of painful Czechoslovakia .

There will always be problems when working with an English vernacular text using cockney or other dialects ,  but students from overseas have to expect to take this in their stride  ( and usually do )  .  Undoubtedly one of the best ways the overseas student has of seeing what is required in British theatre training is to apply for one of the summer schools offered by the drama schools ,  and find out what it 's  all about before committing him -  or herself to a long and expensive stay .  It 's <head>important</head> that a student is prepared to understand and work with the prevalent theatrical traditions in UK schools . And with so much theatre training available in the United States ,  New Zealand ,  Australia and Canada ,  it is interesting to ask why  British theatre training is thought to be so beneficial .  I can only put it down to the strong classical emphasis which prevails in the courses offered in the UK ,  although many of the university drama courses in the USA do stage Shakespeare and the European classical authors .

It can be well worth the additional expense of some private tuition for the audition and gaining one to one advice on your material .  Your own presentation is another thing you need to be aware of .  Clothes are <head>important</head> you should wear something which enhances your own self esteem and creates the right kind of impression . This is sometimes regarded as old fashioned thinking ,  unfortunately ,  and it 's  a shame ,  for although clothes do n't actually make you perform better a good comfortable appearance does give the panel a chance to see how you see yourself and how your body uses clothes .  When presenting a classical and a modern piece women may use a practice skirt for one selection which can be used over jeans ,  or another skirt .

And even more difficult in an audition situation where they are looking at your height ,  weight and how much stage you can fill by your very presence .  Does he engage me ?  That is probably the most <head>important</head> question the panel are asking themselves . And the next thing will be what is his attitude to this audition  is it positive ?  Always remember that they have asked to see you and that is what they want to do .
