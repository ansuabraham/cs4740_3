Old copies are now collectors items ,  with their entertaining instructions and hints .  In 1909 :  The unattached cyclist on entering Italy with his wheel must deposit 42 fr .  60c .  with the custom - house authorities ,  which sum is returned to him  ( though seldom without difficulties )  when he quits the country .  Baedeker acquired a reputation for serious standards , and the traveller who <head>missed</head> a double - asterisked attraction had clearly journeyed in vain . Baedeker in 1909 ,  like Reynolds in his fifth discourse ,  hesitated between two great masters and their works .  Whether the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel or the Stanze of Raphael should be regarded as the culminating effort of modern art ,  has long been the subject of controversy ;  but they both received double asterisks .

What can be deduced from a self - portrait is often controversial ;  a critic is especially likely to read into a self - portrait some opinion held about the artist .  When ,  as in the cases of Rembrandt and Van Gogh ,  there is a whole series of pictures to choose from ,  books can be written on the self - images of one artist alone .  This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's writing , since it tempts the rash into speculation , while an impoverished eye will <head>miss</head> relevant and useful comparisons . A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .  Again ,  much interest attaches to interpretation ,  as an impassive hierarchical image of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure .

The Alexander technique would be invaluable if it were properly included in all drama training programmes .  And I think you find it goes beyond drama school ,  in say a company like the RSC ,  where we have the top person in voice but do not have the equal in physical advice and guidance .  A R. What you are saying is that everyone seems to <head>miss</head> the work of Litz Pisk a legendary movement teacher at Central School who had such movement sense . A S. I remember when I was working as a dogsbody in the 59 Theatre Company in Manchester a group of Central School students came to be the spirits in a production of The Tempest  and these were Pisk trained and had ,  it seemed to me then ,  a marvellous range of body language .  You do see this much more in foreign companies and I think if we in Britain could match the physical and the vocal more we would really be on top with our training resources .

Actually ,  this seldom happens and one technique usually lands before the other. Nevertheless ,  many referees take the easy option and give a simultaneous score decision .  This is all the more annoying when one person 's attack was n't valid anyway because it <head>missed</head> the scoring area , or was otherwise unacceptable . Some referees appear to see only one half of a pair of techniques and ,  while reverse punches are seldom missed ,  snap punches to the face often are .  In such cases ,  the reverse punch may be given simply because the referee failed to recognise the snap punch .

Paul de Man is reported to have said that a  literary work is merely an event in the history of interpretation .  A natural response to this state of affairs would be to say that theory cut off from the writing of literature is no more than a sterile academicism .  But that <head>misses</head> the point , if theory can be identified with literature . These are the symptoms of a triumphant professionalism ,  which is sustained by the particular conditions of American academic life :  the intensely competitive environment of the prestigious graduate schools ,  the free market in salaries which entices the superstars of the profession from one campus to another ,  the large funds available for research ,  journals ,  and conferences .  Admittedly ,  conditions in the American academy are a little tighter than they once were ,  but what looks like stringency by American standards is still lavishness by British ones .

The disappointing slowness of the pitch allowed both openers to play Malcolm off the back foot ,  and therefore to drive his attempted yorkers .

But Fraser , steady as ever after <head>missing</head> five Tests through injury , found enough lift to have Sidhu sharply caught off bat and pad by John Morris . Morris 's  contribution to this match is unlikely to find much space in Wisden ,  but he already looks the part .  When Chris Lewis replaced Malcolm ,  ball dominated bat for the first time in the match ,  with nothing to show for it .

Rugby League :  Kiwis humbled by Saints By PAUL WILSON St Helens . . . . 27 New Zealand . . 26 THE meagre attendance of 6,940 at Knowsley Road was hardly surprising , given Alex Murphy 's under - selling of his own side , but the Saints supporters who stayed away <head>missed</head> a rare and unexpected rugby league treat . Tony Gordon 's  Kiwis ,  who will now find it difficult to go through the remainder of their tour undefeated ,  are not as tight and efficient a force as Graham Lowe 's  team of four years ago ,  but with a virtual Test side out ,  should have been far too strong for Murphy 's  collection of reserves .  That Saints managed to cause an upset with nothing more than direct running and honest endeavour ,  bodes well for Great Britain ,  though the Kiwis cannot be expected to enter the Test arena in such a generous mood .

Bryan Robson 's  injury ,  a legacy of previous combat ,  was diagnosed when he had to be substituted 20 minutes from the end of the first leg at Portsmouth only 13 days ago.

It was immediately assumed that Robson , who had <head>missed</head> England 's 0 - 0 draw in Sweden last month because of bruised ribs , would again be absent when his country strove to acquire the further point they need in Poland to ensure qualification for the World Cup finals next summer . But Bobby Robson said yesterday :  Manchester United have obviously not made the decision to recall him lightly .  Now I 'm looking forward to reviewing the situation after the Portsmouth match .

Unfancied Cumbria were disappointingly unable to reproduce the form that produced that remarkable upset at Aspatria when they beat the title holders a year ago ,  and they were swept aside in a second - half torrent of scoring .  With full - back Ian Hunter not appearing Cumbria were in doubt about their line - up until a few minutes before kick - off ,  but showed no signs of uncertainty when the action began ,  winning a penalty from their first attack .  Andrew Harrison <head>missed</head> a straightforward chance from 25 metres . He missed with two other attempts ,  one from longer range and a sitter from 20 metres ,  failing to reward the efforts of his pack ,  who were considerably outweighed by the Lancashire eight .  Cumbria threatened to fall apart when they lost their hooker ,  Derek Dougan ,  just before the interval ,  as Lancashire 's  Mark Hesketh finished off a surge by Shaun Gallagher ,  initiated by the lively Dewi Morris ,  to give Lancashire a 9 - 0 lead at the break.

Will Clark , the Giants first baseman who narrowly <head>missed</head> the 1989 batting championship with an average of .333 , drove in six runs with two homers - one a grand slam as San Francisco routed the Cubs 11 - 3 in the first game of the best - of - seven National League championship series at Wrigley Field . Rickey Henderson 's  nerveless brilliance between the bases helped the Athletics beat the Blue Jays 6 - 3 in Oakland and earn a 2 - 0 lead in the American League play - off series .  Henderson ,  traded this season from the New York Yankees ,  stole a post - season record four bases  ( in one game )  and scored two runs .

The British penchant for shooting themselves in the foot emerged again when officials decided that professionals who resided and worked outside Britain were ineligible to play ,  although they qualified by birth .  This move was based purely on jealousy ,  as professionals on the Continent enjoyed a far higher standard of living than their British - based counterparts .  The rule also affected Henry Cotton , who took up the post at Royal Waterloo , Belgium , in 1933 and thus <head>missed</head> two Ryder Cup matches when he was at the peak of his powers . Aubrey Boomer also held the post at Royal Waterloo and subsequently moved to the Royal Golf Club de Belgique at Ravenstein .  He was due to attend this year 's  Ryder Cup match at The Belfry ,  but illness prevented him.
