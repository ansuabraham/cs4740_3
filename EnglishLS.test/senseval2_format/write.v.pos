In many of these countries the new respect for human rights was embodied in the repeal or revision of laws used to imprison prisoners of conscience .  But there are still prisoners of conscience in Europe ,  and in every other region of the world .  39 of the prisoners featured in the letter <head>writing</head> campaign have been released ; about 50 remain in prison . None of these people should ever have been prisoners of conscience .  Our task today is to increase the international pressure on behalf of the thousands of prisoners of conscience all over the world ,  to make tomorrow the day their freedom is restored .

Tiao Sisoumang Sisaleumsak and Houmphanh Norasing ,  both detained since 1975 ,  are among 33 detainees still held in Laos '  northeastern province of Houa Phanh .  Their living conditions are harsh with poor provision of housing ,  food and medicines .  The South Korean authorities <head>wrote</head> to AI in response to its appeals for imprisoned artist Hong Song - dam and publisher Chang Ui - gyun . The authorities said that Hong Song - dam was not imprisoned merely for sending his paintings to North Korea and books to Koreans in Germany ,  but because his paintings and contributions to a magazine Art Movement  were aimed at promoting a Marxist - Leninist revolution .  In September 1990 the Supreme Court dismissed the charges of espionage and returned the case to a lower court .

Yours respectfully and sincerely ,  ALISON HENDERSON .  Your Excellency ,  I am <head>writing</head> as I 'm puzzled as to why you have released Kim Hyun - hui who planted a bomb on a plane and killed 115 people but have imprisoned a girl for taking part in a peace march . To me this is odd as if I were the president of South Korea I would have imprisoned Kim Hyun - hui and released Im Su Kyong as to me Kim Hyun - hui committed the more serious crime .  I would like this to be explained to me as I just do n't understand it .

Books and catalogues may contain criticism ;  but their writers may think of themselves as art historians ,  philosophers ,  aestheticians ,  anthropologists ,  historians or biographers ,  and there are many other possibilities ;  their books may never be identified as art criticism .  As the following chapters will show ,  the useful and helpful functions of art criticism will receive preference in the choice of what is quoted or discussed .  Is the text or part of the text <head>written</head> so that a reader will benefit in a future encounter with a work of art ? Some writing which is called art criticism will be helpful ,  some will not ;  other writing will also be valuable ,  although whether it can be described as art criticism may be disputable .

ART CRITICISM AND ART HISTORY Do art historians write about the past ,  while art critics write about the present ?  Things are not so simple , as some art historians <head>write</head> well about the present , with a generosity of feeling and approach enriching to contemporary culture . They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,  partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro ,  who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,  was an open - minded historian of this sort .

By the 1850s the tradition had declined ,  so that Baudelaire was seeking to give new life to a decayed literary genre .  He asserted that a modern artist should be in tune with his times ,  careful to avoid hackneyed subjects .  Typically , a laudatory essay he <head>wrote</head> was called The Painter of Modern Life on the subject of the illustrator Constantin Guys ; this gifted if minor artist was accurately targeted by Baudelaire as being in the mainstream of contemporary social and political life . Guys '  drawings appeared in such papers as the Illustrated London News  ,  a very successful venture begun in 1842 ,  the decade which also saw the founding of satirical journals like  Punch  or Kladderadatsch  .  The illustrated periodical was a phenomenon of a world which Baudelaire saw as reborn on Guys '  paper :

Between these two ridges the fire of the sunset falls along the trough of the sea ,  dyeing it with an awful but glorious light ,  the intense and lurid splendour which burns like gold ,  and bathes like blood .  Along this fiery path and valley ,  the tossing waves by which the swell of the sea is restlessly divided ,  lift themselves in dark ,  indefinite ,  fantastic forms ,  each casting a faint and ghastly shadow behind it along the illumined foam Purple and blue , the lurid shadows of the hollow breakers are cast upon the mist of night , which gathers cold and low , advancing like the shadow of death upon the guilty ship as it labours amid the lightening of the sea , its thin mast <head>written</head> upon the sky , in lines of blood I believe ,  if I were reduced to rest Turner 's  immortality upon any single work ,  I should choose this .  Its daring conception ,  ideal in the highest sense of the word ,  is based on the purest truth ,  and wrought out with the concentrated knowledge of a life ,  its colour is almost perfect ,  not one false or morbid hue in any part or line ,  and so modulated that every square inch of canvas is a perfect composition ;  its drawing is as accurate as fearless ;  the ship buoyant ,  bending ,  and full of motion ;  its tones as true as they are wonderful ;  and the whole picture dedicated to the most sublime of subjects and impressions the power ,  majesty and deathfulness of the open ,  deep ,  illimitable sea .

Beneath a sultry sky ,  at four o'clock ,  the island ,  boats slipping past its flank ,  stirring with a casual Sunday crowd enjoying the fresh air among the trees ;  and these forty or so figures are endowed with a succinct ,  hieratic line The atmosphere is transparent and uncommonly vibrant ;  the surface seems to flicker or glimmer .  Fnon , like other excellent critics , was a valued friend of artists , and so he remained all his life even though he gave up <head>writing</head> criticism after a decade of working on the Revue blanche from 1893 to 1903 . He accepted a position in a dealer 's  gallery ,  where Matisse was among the artists who benefited from his judgement .  A thumbnail sketch by a friend brings Fnon to life :  He did not thrust himself upon you .

Alfred Barr ,  the first director of the Museum of Modern Art ,  New York ,  is exemplary .  In 1936 ,  for example ,  the Museum put on two crucially important exhibitions ,  on Cubist and Abstract Art  ,  and Fantastic Art ,  Dada ,  Surrealism  .  For the latter catalogue Barr chose the Surrealist writer Georges Hugnet to <head>write</head> a historical essay , but it was Barr 's intelligent advocacy and choice of works that made the show such a significant affair . In place of the aggressive approach of the early years of Surrealism itself ,  Barr 's  commentary is in moderated phrases pointing to similarities between Surrealism and works firmly within the tradition of Western art :  The explanation of the kind of art shown in this exhibition may be sought in the deep - seated and persistent interest which human beings have in the fantastic ,  the irrational ,  the spontaneous ,  the marvellous ,  the enigmatic ,  and the dreamlike .

On Dada he wrote :  With robust iconoclastic  humor  the Dadaists mocked what they considered the sorry shams of European culture .  They even attacked art  especially modern art  but while they made fun of the pre - War Cubists ,  Expressionists and futurists ,  they borrowed and transformed many of the principles and techniques of these earlier movements .  Barr , in what used to be a general policy for museum curators , was not <head>writing</head> a passionate defence of the work his museum exhibited . Rather ,  the Museum does not intend to sponsor a particular aspect of modern art ,  but rather to make a report to the public by offering material for study and comparison .  Barr 's  European equivalents flourished in the 1950s rather than the  1930s  Jean Cassou at the Muse d'Art Moderne in Paris ,  Wilhelm Sandberg at the Stedlijk in Amsterdam ,  Pontus Hulten at the Modern Museum in Stockholm and then at the Pompidou Centre in Paris .

My aim was to investigate the symptoms of decay and perhaps to discover in the capriciousness and the return to chaos a law which would vouchsafe one an insight into the intimate workings of art .  This ,  I confess ,  is to me the real aim of art history .  In 1964 Peter Murray <head>wrote</head> an introduction to a new edition , in which he made an observation about the passage on Bernini 's St Teresa , the sculptural group in Rome which is a key work of the Baroque : Bernini is evidently attempting to render something quite transcendental and something which had never been attempted by a sculptor before that date .  Indeed ,  it is possible to argue that St Teresa 's  mystical ecstasies are themselves something entirely new in the spiritual life of Europe

More informal guidance can be found in books with a personal approach ,  in which class the Companion Guide to Rome  by Georgina Masson is exemplary  ( first published in 1965 )  .  There is adequate historical data about the Sistine Chapel ,  but there is also a personal response :  More , probably , has been <head>written</head> about this great hall - like chapel than any other building in the world ; but in fact no description , picture or photograph conveys the impact which it makes . Perhaps the first ,  and in the end the most lasting ,  impression that one carries away ,  is of the contrast between the golden - cream light and space and the exquisite feeling of harmony engendered by the ceiling as opposed to the deep blue darkness and turmoil of the Last Judgment .  Georgina Masson 's  special gift was her ability to disentangle and evoke in Rome three different cities ,  of Classical Antiquity ,  of the Renaissance ,  and of the Baroque .

How beautiful ,  how devoid of everything like the handicraft of art it is  the largeness ,  and yet ingenuity of its effect  the purity of its colour  the truth ,  yet refinement and elegance of the action ,  particularly of the hands  ( in which he particularly excels )  ;  and then ,  a lesson to all high - minded slovens ,  the patient vigilance with which the whole is linked together ,  by touches ,  in some instances small almost as a miniature ,  but like the sparkling of water .  Diaries are perhaps more often a vehicle for complaints .  Here is an American artist <head>writing</head> about his dismay at the work he saw at Paris in 1831 : Although I had been informed that the present French artists were low in merit ,  I did not expect to find them ,  with little exception ,  so totally devoid of it .  I was disgusted in the beginning with their subjects .

On the engraving of the picture made by Gisbert van Geen in 1588 ,  for which Pozzoferrato supplied the ornamental framework and  which Ridolfi reproduced in his biography ,  Tintoretto is described as being seventy years old .  According to this the picture must have been painted about 1588 ,  with which the style and the age of the sitter agree. From a letter to Francesco Gonzaga , <head>written</head> in 1622 and published by A. Luzio , in which among others a self - portrait of Tintoretto is offered to him , Pittalunga argues that the Paris picture may have been the one mentioned and which formed part of Rubens 's estate . This sort of reading is only for the dedicated follower of the history of taste ,  though any reader particularly interested in a picture may find within a single catalogue entry an acutely discriminating judgement or interesting facts ;  for example ,  Tietze 's  entry also points out that Manet so much admired the Tintoretto self - portrait that he made a copy of it .  The catalogue raisonn continues to be a key document for authentication of an artist 's  work .

The facilities available for television training differs from school to school ;  filming and television work is expensive to organise ,  and really there is not so much opportunity as one would like to see for students to gain experience in these vital areas .  However ,  where facilities are available for use over short periods of time ,  the rudiments of camera acting are taught in a structured way .  ( Some schools have been able to co - ordinate work with the National Film School , where a script has been <head>written</head> for the personalities in a group and then filmed on location , and this worked effectively . ) But it 's  true to say that most actors feel their drama school training has left them inadequately prepared for working in television and film by the time they graduate .

If an agent is interested in you he may well have useful comments on the photo you send of yourself ,  on your style and how you present yourself .  Remember this will be a professional opinion from someone who is interested in the qualities you now have to offer ,  so bear such comment well in mind .  The drama school will give you some advice on when and where to <head>write</head> to , and how you organise your letters , but outside advice is very important in helping you to see yourself in perspective . Letters and the curriculum vitae Writing letters about yourself is never easy  we tend either to say too much or too little .

If you are fortunate enough to have secured an agent you will have someone with whom you can talk .  Your agent will want you to be working ,  but they cannot perform miracles for you .  It will be up to you to <head>write</head> constantly and make contacts everywhere and you will largely be responsible for yourself . You always have your agent to refer to should anyone make you an offer .  If you have had problems finding an agent ,  you might consider the possibility of applying to join a co - operative where actors work together and run their own agency .
