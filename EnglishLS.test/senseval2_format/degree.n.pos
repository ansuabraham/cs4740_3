While the situation in the south remains a major concern ,  greater violations of human rights are now occurring in the North and Eastern provinces of the island ,  where government security forces are engaged in a full - scale civil war with elements of the Tamil - minority population .

The conflict has continued , with varying <head>degrees</head> of intensity , for over 10 years . Predictably ,  the main sufferers since fighting flared once more in June 1990 have been the civilian populations  Tamil ,  Sinhalese and Moslem .

Van Gogh 's  life has so often been made the subject of literary treatment that the art historian is strongly inclined to leave the biographical matter severely alone and concentrate exclusively on the artistic aspect .  But he is soon forced to the conclusion that in this case it is impossible to keep the aesthetic side entirely apart from the biographical .  The reason is that with Van Gogh art and life are not merely conditioned by each other to a greater <head>degree</head> than with any other artist , but actually merge with each other. In a sense ,  Van Gogh 's  life is itself an artistic creation .  Van Gogh as the subject for a biographer is thus a test case .

Continuing or worsening strife could solidify covenant beliefs into a separate Ulster identity absolutely dominant over the British component ,  and demanding its own independent state form .  It is important to note that in 191214 the protestant  loyalist group saw their right to violence as prior to that of the official state .  It is also important to note that they saw the taking of law into their own hands as temporary , and pending the recognition by that state of its mistaken attitude towards them and their right to a <head>degree</head> of autonomy . It appears to be increasingly the case that there are two major traditions of identity perception among protestant loyalists .

To a <head>degree</head> it is widespread among many not just in the provisional movement but also in the Fianna Fil party , and in general among those who see their history as one of liberation through blood .

The Easter rising of 1916 as an act of national liberation ,  unquestioned in the dominant catholic  nationalist culture from 1922 until well into the 1960s and 1970s ,  still holds a cherished place in the hearts of the majority of the people .

The reaction of the first Dil to successive attempts to introduce legislation for divorce was to change standing orders so that such a bill could not be introduced again .  Since the new constitution was enacted in 1937 ,  the prohibition on divorce has become so strict that couples who have been granted a nullity decree by Roman catholic canonical tribunals have found that they may still not be recognized as single by the state ,  and are thus unable to remarry in the Republic .  There has been a <head>degree</head> of attenuation of this rigidity in some respects , but only in favour of the church 's interpretation . People seeking to remarry must first get a divorce abroad  which in practice means Britain .  Naturally ,  apart from the accusation of hypocrisy and of letting Britain solve its marriage problems ,  the government ends up being accused of allowing divorce for the wealthy and none for the poor ,  as the cost of going to and staying in Britain and paying for the legal procedures is beyond the pockets of the majority .

As will be elaborated now in further contexts ,  it appears that the underlying reality to such difficulties was ,  and remains a complex contradiction which the catholic  nationalist alliance has still failed to solve .  On the one hand there were the beliefs in the nature and extent of the clergy 's  political religious power and how that power was to be exercised in the state .  There was also the general assumption that the fact of a state populated by catholics must perforce imply a heightened <head>degree</head> of institutionalized catholic value in law. On the other hand ,  there was the nationalist theory of democracy ,  which derives power from the people and not from an lite group of religious intellectuals .  The next section will show the way in which this contradiction continued to be shared by a large number of clergy and laity even into the 1980s .

In reaction to this ,  one can say that the very way in which the church leaders view the subject is itself revealing of significant mediations between religion ,  state ,  and national ideology in the institutions of schooling .  In the debates over the last twenty years there has been considerable interplay of theological and sociological reasoning ,  with social scientists also contributing to papers and discussions .  What has been seen as an aspect of the Roman catholic intellectual opposition to divorce in Chapter 5 can also be recognized as a feature of the defence of catholic schools too : the opposition contains an interpretation of the moral nature of contemporary society and of what happens to catholics who are not to some <head>degree</head> protected from it . In this writer 's  view ,  the arguments against multi - denominational education and in favour of catholic schools support an overall political theology which is strongly based on authority within the church .  Hierarchy and clergy are seen almost to monopolize the teaching and wisdom about life .

A cellar ,  well - ventilated attic or frost - free shed is ideal ,  whereas inhabited rooms are usually too  warm and encourage early dessication .

In this situation ,  the marginal mover acquires the power to reinterpret the way his institutional structure governs a desire for a rigidified world of immobility ,  and to understand why ,  for example ,  those few policemen who move into other areas ,  such as probation work or the legal profession ,  become totally suspect .  Transition to the outside destroys the manufactured reality of one real world and two ex - police probation officers I knew became  the equivalent of potential prigs .  Again it is this incomprehension of social mobility which seems to have caused my ACC to describe an officer who took a <head>degree</head> and then left to become a solicitor as a bad experience for the force ( and not a gain for society ) . And it is the same logic which attributes those few out of the 120,000 officers who pursue schemes designed to accelerate promotion with the derisory and metaphorically ephemeral classification of high - flyers or butterfly boys .  I now see that between 1958 and 1977 I was involved in what might well be described as a social drama of movement ,  often crossing boundaries into very marginal areas of policing ,  where the institutional ideal of ordered definition fails simply because the use of power and exercise of authority are based in ambiguity and particular interpretations of what is often poorly framed legislation  ( Burton 1980 )  .

Two weeks after my course finished and I was back in the real world on a murder enquiry ,  I received notification I had been awarded the second scholarship in the force .  My predecessor had read law and obtained a first ,  but I chose to read social anthropology simply because of a pleasure in the subject .  As I have shown above , there is a strong tendency in the organization to dismiss the social sciences , and it therefore seems fair to suggest that any police officer who elects to read for a <head>degree</head> in that discipline is knowingly placing himself into a position of outsider . My inclination to reject law as a possible course was incomprehensible to many ,  and while I was waiting to go to university I was constantly challenged about this .

The physical basis of the measurement leads to a linear response over a wide dynamic range ,  and reduces saturation and hysteresis effects .

In the recent history of British culture the study of English Literature in secondary and tertiary education comprised a recognizable form of life ,  principled but not theoretical .  In institutional practice ,  English in public schools tended to be marginal and somewhat disregarded ,  but became central in the culture of the grammar schools ,  in ways adumbrated and advocated in the Newbolt Report .  That culture presupposed a high <head>degree</head> of what E. D. Hirsch calls cultural literacy , particularly in respect of English history and the Christian and classical heritages , requiring competence in Latin and at least one modern language , as well as wide reading in English Literature over and above the demands of the curriculum . This form of life was shared by the sixth forms of grammar schools and the universities to which their students proceeded ,  and it did not greatly differ whether the frame of reference was Cambridge or Oxford ,  or to import an Arnoldian variation on this model ,  Hebraic or Hellenic ,  directed towards criticism or appreciation .  ( Leavis ,  a forceful opponent of traditional literary education ,  indicated in Education and the University  just how much cultural competence he took for granted in the student .  )

There was a critical paper in the Oxford <head>degree</head> , but the emphasis was substantially on scholarship of a tough traditional kind , without much concession to the Arnoldian free play of mind . For a long time Oxford English was directed towards scholarship and was suspicious of criticism ,  and this attitude was reflected in its house organ ,  The Review of English Studies  .  Helen Gardner ,  for many years an Oxford luminary ,  did not believe that the purpose of English was to turn out critics ,  any more than it was to produce poets and novelists .

In the high - pressured and directive context of undergraduate teaching it may be desirable ,  but is not practically possible .  Too often ,  even the desirability is not recognized .

There are elements of a vicious version of the hermeneutic circle involved :  people do n't like poetry because they have n't read enough to come to terms with it ,  and they have n't read enough because they do n't like it .  Several factors are involved in this unhappy state of affairs :  a general decline in cultural literacy ,  and in skill and practice in reading .

Cultural Studies would provide a more productive environment for the radical aca - English Departments ,  who have conspicuous energy and intelligence ,  but little literary sensibility or aesthetic interests .

I would certainly not favour a rump version of one of the current forms of English degree ,  with their recurring arguments about canons and coverage ,  the definition of literature ,  and the place of theory .  Instead ,  I propose taking the logic of generic concentration as far as it can go ,  with a degree which would study ,  in detail ,  a single genre ,  poetry .  There are certain academic precedents , particularly the uncontroversial establishment in a number of universities of degrees in drama , which do work previously thought of as belonging to an English <head>degree</head> . The other model I have in mind is the degree in music ,  which is intensive ,  technical ,  and demanding ,  and attracts a small number of well - qualified entrants .  A degree of a comparable kind ,  directed at poetry ,  is ,  I think ,  feasible ,  and would be more coherent and rewarding than existing degrees in English Literature .

The canon would be largely English ,  not for a priori nationalistic reasons ,  but because it is written in English ,  and until fairly recently most poetry written in English was also written in England ,  or at least ,  in the British Isles .  There is no reason why American poetry ,  or poetry from other anglophone literatures ,  should not be read ,  given a minimal amount of culture and contextual instruction  ( which may also be needed ,  of course ,  in the reading of English poems )  .  To what extent students on such a <head>degree</head> would also need to read poetry in another language is a difficult question . In principle it is extremely desirable ,  not only because of the basic otherness of foreign poetry ,  but because such knowledge gives one a better sense of what English poetry can and cannot do .  In practice ,  given the monoglot tendency in secondary education it might be difficult to recruit students with the necessary competence .

Poetry ,  of course ,  can never become  music ,  despite the dream of nineteenth century symbolists ,  since ,  as Eliot 's  Sweeney put it ,  I gotta use words when I talk to you .  But a restatement of that ancient affinity should strengthen poetry against political and culturalist claims .  The academic study of music may be a specialist field , but music , of every kind , is widely diffused and performed ; only a small percentage of those attending concerts or recitals will have taken <head>degrees</head> in music . Similarly ,  one would like to see a state of affairs in which many more people read and enjoyed poetry than had taken a degree in it .  The degree in poetry I have outlined would attempt to be open about its theoretical assumptions .

Fascinating as this is ,  it is surely with relief that we return from thus checking printed source against printed source ,  cross - referring and tentatively identifying ,  to the open air of the roads of France .  And indeed I would insist on this :  the first requirement for a study of Pound is a set of maps  ( preferably half an inch to the mile )  of at any rate certain regions of France ,  Italy and England ;  the second requirement is a set of Michelin Green Guides for France and Italy ,  and  ( if one is American )  similar guides to the South of England .  In this , the case of Pound is no different from other writers , or it is different only in <head>degree</head> . Yet ,  oddly ,  the only authors for whom we are ready to make this provision nowadays are the Irish ones ,  Joyce and Yeats .

KEN LIVINGSTONE was yesterday knocked off Labour 's  national executive in a vote which took the Brent East MP and his left - wing associates by surprise .  The likeliest explanation of his defeat in the executive 's  constituency section vote is that party activists wanted to rebuke him for publicly rocking the boat during the passage of the policy review .  Robin Cook , the party 's health spokesman , who retained his executive seat by coming second , said the vote showed the <head>degree</head> to which the party wanted to elect people who devoted their energies to helping Labour to win the next election . Ken Livingstone 's  problem is that he is always on the television slagging the party off .  It may also turn out Mr Livingstone lost because more constituencies this year balloted their full membership ,  rather than leaving it to their activist general committees to decide .

As dawn broke yesterday ,  the same group ,  this time led by a mother with a baby in arms ,  faced down the police patrols and reached the embassy successfully .  On Sunday West Germany had complained about the police presence around its embassy ,  and the slackening of restrictions is thought to have reflected an apparent Czechoslovak desire to remain as far as possible on good terms with both Germanies .  West Germany has so far denied , although with a detectable <head>degree</head> of ambiguity , that any deal was made , preferring to point to the humanitarian reasons for allowing an evacuation of the embassy , and the pressure supposedly exerted on East Germany by the Soviet Union to bring the occupation to a speedy end . But from East Germany 's  angry response to the opening of the embassy doors  -  echoed ,  ominously ,  by Czechoslovakia  it appears that East Germany was at least expecting a quid pro quo .  The desire of Hans - Dietrich Genscher ,  the West German Foreign Minister ,  to deliver the West German side of the bargain appears to have been dissolved by the prospect of television pictures showing young East German families ,  including pregnant women ,  hungry and crying on the pavement outside an unwelcoming West German embassy .

Now ,  as John Bowker has pointed out in the first article in this series ,  to say that God is not affected by His creatures is not to say that He takes no interest in them ,  nor that ,  seen from our viewpoint as creatures in time and space ,  God cannot do one thing at one moment and something apparently quite different the next .  It is inevitable and right that if we are to make God real for ourselves we must , to a considerable <head>degree</head> , speak of Him in human terms , which is what the Bible does when it speaks of Him as repenting , changing His mind , being provoked or made angry or sorrowful . But we must never forget the inadequacy of all human language before the mystery of God 's  essential being ,  of God as God .  What is important is that God always acts towards us with an outbreak of invariable love ,  the expression of His unchanging nature .

Some of these are worth highlighting in greater detail as a means of contextualizing the data and illustrating some of the social processes operating upon them .  One of the consequences of the RUC 's  dual role is that it has features typical of most police forces and qualities special to it .

The latter makes what is already an internally homogeneous organization even more enclosed and protective .

It is possible to cite one case to illustrate what they try to do for victims which further demonstrates the commitment of the unit to a welfare service role .  An elderly widow who was robbed ,  attacked ,  and raped by a gang of youths was moved to sheltered dwellings with the help of the police ,  visited by policewomen from the unit at least once a week ,  and taken regularly to visit the family of one of the policewomen ,  which adopted her as the children 's  granny .  But this <head>degree</head> of involvement takes its toll on policewomen in the unit . Having to talk little children through the horrors which some adults inflict upon them is horrific and stressful ,  and emotional distancing is difficult to maintain when you are dealing only with sex abuse cases day after day .

Nor is the idea of community policing popular amongst ordinary constables in other sections of the police ,  often because it contradicts their views of what constitutes real police work ,  but also because they have misguided notions about what community policing is ,  as well as a practical awareness of the unrealistic expectations held of it by enthusiasts .  In the RUC , for example , a group of policemen and women taking a police studies <head>degree</head> were asked their opinions on community policing , and the following remarks are typical : What gets me about this guy Alderson is that he served in the country area of Cornwall ,  and he makes all these proposals about inner - city policing ;  now how the hell would he know anything about the inner city ?

As an example ,  consider the difficulty experienced by overseas companies wishing to begin direct operations in Japan ,  where applications were vetted by the National Planning Authority to ensure that they fitted the national economic plan of Japan .  At best ,  admission was obtained only on the basis of a joint venture with a Japanese company ,  and entry of any kind was often impossible to obtain ,  at least until the Japanese themselves had established a strong presence  domestically and internationally  in the market sector concerned .  This situation has been ameliorated to a <head>degree</head> , in the face of overseas pressure to change the system , not least because of the Japanese need to maintain its market position in other countries , and concern about retaliatory measures against Japanese imports . This sort of interdependence of interests is a feature of the relations between industrialised countries ;  having built a strong overseas market position ,  a country will be forced to take more account of external pressures if that strong position is to be maintained .  The future behaviour of Japan ,  then ,  may be analysed in terms of the balance between commercial self - interest and the basic protectionist nature of many of the trade restrictions which still exist .

Political balance cannot be achieved by criticizing one party during the mid - term of a parliament and another at election time .

What is remarkable is that Mrs Thatcher has interfered in departmental matters to a greater <head>degree</head> than many of her predecessors . She has busied herself in the promotion of senior civil servants  ( looking for people with energy and commitment )  and regularly badgered departments about progress on particular policies  like a dog after a bone an adviser claims .

The underlying balance - of - payments problems stemmed essentially from the scale of government overseas expenditure and foreign investment ,  these amounting to more than eight times the aggregate current account deficit for 194650  ( see Table 1 )  .  On overseas government expenditure Attlee fought a campaign with what has been called an impressive Little Englander ' pragmatism ' which ,  however ,  ran against the rocks of Bevin and the Chiefs of Staff .  Nevertheless , and no doubt too slowly , illusions of grandeur were slowly given up and Britain 's incapacity to live with the superpowers was to a <head>degree</head> accepted . Arguably more important in the long run was the illusion of grandeur in the monetary field .

He had aimed to go to Cambridge to read geography ,  but failed the Latin entrance examination it was necessary to take in those days. In the event ,  he was accepted at Birmingham University ,  but just before he arrived he was informed that the geography department had been closed down because of austerity measures brought in during World War N. He therefore decided to read geology instead ,  but shortly afterwards he received notification that this department was also to be closed .  The next best option was to take a BSc <head>degree</head> in coal - mining and that was how he ended up becoming a mining engineer instead of a teacher , which in all probability is the career he would have followed if he had managed to fulfil his original goal of studying geography . Forty years later ,  after an enormously varied industrial career that has seen Haslam running a diverse range of businesses and involved in a wide variety of functions ,  from selling to personnel ,  events have turned full circle .  His early days underground working alongside miners on the coal - face have imbued him with a special rapport with the thousands of miners he now oversees as chairman of British Coal .

His survival over the years since independence in 1961 does not alter the fact that the discussion of real policy choices in a public manner has hardly ever occurred .  This is not to say that the National Executive Committee of the ruling party allows Nyerere total control of the party and therefore of government policy ;  in fact there have always been a number of important policy issues which Nyerere has had to argue through the NEC and which he has not always won .  One such issue since the Union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964 has been the <head>degree</head> of influence of leading Zanzibari politicians in the affairs of the mainland government and party , and the status of Zanzibar in general . Another ,  in the late 1960s ,  was the position of the Ruvuma Development Association  ( RDA )  ,  a group of seven villages near Songea in the extreme south - western corner of Tanzania which grouped themselves in an association of mutual support designed to foster their development and which were ultimately compulsorily disbanded in 1969 .  However ,  none of the major stages in Tanzania 's  development as a centralized socialist state were publicly discussed in any way which made open debate possible .

The existence of the gentile constitution shows that order can exist without the State .

Yet the fact that many primitive peoples regulate interpersonal relations with a fair <head>degree</head> of predictability and humanity , without the help of a centralized political system , is one that most anthropologists would now endorse ; however , unlike Engels , they do this without pointing out the political implications of such an observation . For Engels ,  by contrast ,  the possibility revealed by the gentile constitution was a major guarantee that the Marxist vision of the withering away of the State in a future communist society was not a recipe for chaos ,  as was argued by his opponents .  The correlation which Morgan and Engels make between very simple agriculture and herding and the gentile constitution is a rare example of a proposition of this kind which has held up fairly well in the light of recent research .

The influence of the Situationists is clearly demonstrated  ( if overstated )  in these books .  If the historical trajectory of the Scrapbook is followed  ( SI through Fluxus ,  Heatwave ,  King Mob ,  Jamie Reid ,  Vivienne Westwood ,  and the Sex Pistols )  the Situationist role for the intellectual as an informed but passionate critic gives way to philistine incitements to violence  ( typified by King Mob in Britain ,  the Motherfuckers in the USA ,  and also indirectly the punk phenomenon )  but more commonly a laidback and philosophically weak critique of everyday life .  The political and philosophical origins of Situationist thought to a large <head>degree</head> derives from Marx 's critique of alienation and commodity fetishism , Lukcs 's development of this critique , and the Marxist - existentialism of Sartre and Henri Lefebvre . The rejection of liberal democracy and bureaucratic Marxism led the Situationists away from dominant political organisations and towards libertarian and syndicalist influences .  The ideas of Anton Pannekoek which emerged with the publication of his Workers '  Council  after World War One provided a ready - made model of a non - hierarchical political system .

The salt retains the extracted moisture ,  thus inhibiting the growth of bacteria which require moisture to flourish in the food .  Before refrigeration ,  salting was about the only process reliable enough to preserve meat .  The same principle is still used , to a lesser <head>degree</head> , where vegetables containing bitter juices , such as aubergines and courgettes , are sprinkled with salt and then left until the juices have been drawn from the flesh . Vegetables treated in this way must be washed very thoroughly before use to remove both the extracted juices and the surplus salt .  Saltpetre ,  or potassium nitrate ,  is a preserving salt usually available only at a chemist 's  or pharmacy and is most commonly used to preserve the pink colour of pickled or salt beef .

  Humans have a special affinity for dolphins , which are widely perceived as having a special <head>degree</head> of intelligence . In fact ,  the sperm whale  ( one of the toothed whales )  boasts the largest brain on the planet ,  and in many dolphins ,  the arrangement and complexity of the brain and nervous system show striking similarities to those of humans .  The small cetaceans  ( dolphins ,  porpoises ,  and small toothed whales )  show a remarkable range of adaptations to life in and under the surface of the ocean .

The ratio of brain weight to spinal cord weight is considered a better measurement of complexity and intelligence .  In fishes ,  the brain weighs less than the spinal cord ;  in the horse the ratio is about 2.5 to 1 ;  in the cat 5 to 1 ;  in apes about 8 to 1 ;  and in humans about 50 to 1 .  The bottlenose dolphin has an average ratio of 40 to 1 , the dusky dolphin about 35 to 1 , and Dall 's porpoise about 26 to 1 , suggesting that dolphins generally show a <head>degree</head> of intelligence comparable with that of humans . EXPLORING INTERSPECIES COMMUNICATION Scientific study of whales and dolphins began as far back as the fourth century BC ,  when the Greek philosopher Aristotle observed and experimented with live animals .

Perrin believes that fishermen in many countries catch dolphins in set - nets ,  but are not required to report the deaths to fisheries authorities .  Among the nations that provide no information on incidental catch in gill - nets are :  Pakistan ,  Bangladesh ,  Indonesia ,  the Philippines ,  Surinam ,  the Malagasy Republic ,  Papua New Guinea ,  Brazil ,  Argentina ,  the French Antilles ,  Venezuela ,  Mozambique ,  Tanzania ,  Kenya ,  the Somali Republic ,  Burma ,  Thailand ,  Malaysia ,  Kampuchea ,  and Vietnam .  Even in countries with laws that provide some <head>degree</head> of protection for marine mammals , fishermen are often reluctant to report incidental catches of dolphins or porpoises because they fear having restrictions placed on their use of set - nets . In the Gulf of Maine ,  commercial mackerel fishermen have kept silent for years about the number of harbour porpoises dying in their nets .  The truth was revealed only by chance ,  when a journalist for the US magazine Sports Illustrated  happened to be aboard a boat when it hauled up seven dead porpoises ,  caught in a single set .

Thus the dark matter would be spread around in a way that mimicked but exaggerated the initial fluctuations .  Everyday atoms would fall in towards the dark matter ,  and eventually form stars and galaxies ,  highlighting the peaks in the distribution of dark matter .  Computer models show that the best way of coming up with an inflationary universe that shows the same <head>degree</head> of clumpiness as the real one is to use dark matter that is cold . Cold dark - matter particles move slowly  hot ones move at nearly the speed of light .  Because hot dark matter is always rushing about ,  it wipes out details ,  and does not allow thin delicate structures like those seen in the sky .

At the Brighton conference ,  though ,  it came under attack from those who make maps of the sky .  A group based in Oxford and Cambridge produced a picture that shows the positions of 2m galaxies in the sky .  Although the map does not reveal how far away they are , and thus their three - dimensional layout , statistics derived from it show a higher <head>degree</head> of structure at large scales supercluster size and upwards than CDM would predict . It is possible to make three - dimensional maps .  There are ways to measure the distance to nearby galaxies that do not rely on their red shift .

Hongkong Bank 's  backbone is a cadre of 450 international officers  mostly Anglo - Saxon males  ( or Scottish - accented Celts )  .

The meaning of hostage It was good to see references at last to what I had always understood to be the correct meaning of hostage  ( April 27th )   that is ,  a person given to another as a pledge  ( Oxford dictionary )  .  My emphasis is on given : it denotes a <head>degree</head> of willingness on the part of the giver . Those wretched people held by Saddam at the start of the Kuwait invasion were prisoners .  Hostages are a useful as well as a time - honoured gesture of mutual trust .

The day after their attack ,  the American embassy in Thailand gave warning that it knew of a credible threat to American ,  British and Australian interests in Bangkok .

Asia 's governments have responded to the war with varying <head>degrees</head> of enthusiasm , discomfort and cynicism . Top of the cynics is China .  The Chinese have given just enough support to the allies to bring themselves back into favour with the western governments ,  particularly America 's  ,  that had spurned them after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 .

Not only in law ,  but in ordinary life ,  we look upon an act done by one man in pursuance of another 's  orders as done by the person who gives the order .  Moreover ,  there seems to be nothing artificial in principle in holding the acts of an employee done in the course of his employment as equivalent to the acts of the employer .  These principles , are , however , applied in different <head>degrees</head> in the respective spheres of Criminal and Civil Law . A man is not punishable for a serious crime committed by another unless he has actually instigated the commission of a crime ,  and then he will be punishable though the crime committed may differ in some degree from that which he instigated .  It may be noted that in Criminal Law anyone who aids ,  counsels ,  or procures the commission of an offence is liable to be tried and punished in the same way as if he were a principal offender .

One problem during the tour had centred on the young fast bowler Roy Gilchrist ,  who had been sent home from India for disciplinary reasons ;  after the tour ,  opinion was divided as to whether his misdemeanours should mean the end of his Test career or whether he should be helped back into the fold by someone such as Worrell ,  whom he worshipped .  In the end ,  the WICBC 's  attitude that they could not accept any individual who did not uphold their tradition of sportsmanship prevailed ,  and Gilchrist played no more Tests .  So far , with Worrell having turned down the chance , no one had been able to complain about the captaincy ; but by now Worrell had his <head>degree</head> , was very much available , and Alexander himself expected him to be made captain for the tour by England in 195960 . Instead ,  Alexander was reappointed .  Perhaps it was a show of  support for his disciplining of Gilchrist ;  perhaps there was the feeling that Worrell had drifted away from the hub of West Indies cricket ;  or perhaps once again the selectors simply could not bring themselves to appoint a black man.

A small collection can be monitored regularly by carrying out a check of all objects against the register ,  but in the case of a very large collection this may well be impracticable .  The British Museum has  ( or is believed to have )  some 5 or 6 million objects ,  so that a conventional stock - take of the entire collection could occupy all the qualified staff for five or six years and could be exhaustive only if all other duties were suspended for the duration .  However , a branch of statistics called sampling theory can be applied , which will allow conclusions about the entire collection to be inferred ( to within a known <head>degree</head> of certainty ) by checking on a small percentage of it . Statistical sampling is widely used in scientific experiments and market surveys .  It also has applications in field archaeology where financial or time constraints preclude excavation of more than part of a site ,  and where it is therefore important that the excavated part yields as much information as possible .
