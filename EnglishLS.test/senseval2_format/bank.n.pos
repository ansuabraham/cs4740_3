Thus ,  the first payment should be on or after the date on which the Deed of Covenant is signed .  You cannot simply draw up a covenant  ( or a Deposited Covenant Agreement )  to cover a donation you have already made in the hope that ACET can obtain tax advantage on the sum given .  However , it can be possible for the documents to be signed after you have sent a payment by cheque provided that you arrange for us to hold the cheque and not pay it into the <head>bank</head> until we have received the signed Deed of Covenant . What happens if I have difficulty in continuing to make payments ?  If this unlikely situation arises ,  you should discuss the problem with us .

Cash only .  Only payments of cash of at least 600 fall within the scope of Gift Aid .  Cash includes cheque payments , <head>bank</head> transfers and credit card payments . Thus the transfer of an asset to a charity e.g. a work of art ,  will not qualify  ( although there are other ways for a charity to obtain tax relief on the gift of an asset )  .  Nor will it be possible to make  a  regular contributions below the 600 limit  ( though see 5 .  below )  .

I spent that night in a straitjacket of fear .

As I had never actually made a cold application for a job before ,  I did n't really know what to make of this .

Anderson seemed to be the only person at home ;  he sold them jugs of ale ,  small beer for the children ;  James 's  credit was good for a stone jar of whisky and one of the Duke 's  men was detailed to carry it on his back in a wicker frame .  They might have become becalmed there as their heads ballooned with the drink but the Duke told his piper to rouse their feet with a steady march ,  Murdo Mackenzie of Torridon ,  and they headed off downstream towards Grandtully past the standing stone ,  the quiet watcher ,  while damp black shadow massed in the river - channel as though the night came from there .  on the far <head>bank</head> Cameron had outstripped them , his army moving steadily down the strath , winning signatures at the house of Cluny , at Clochfoldich and Pitnacree , by the solid slow avalanche of their numbers , massing quietly round each house , hammering three times on each door . By this time every gentleman knew what was expected of him :  Cameron never dismounted ,  he leaned from the saddle and passed the paper down to the angry ,  helpless proprietor and took it back signed .  The west windows of Hope Steuart 's  place at Ballechin flared with sunset ,  as though fires blazed inside it .

In junction box  wiring ,  the lighting cable goes from the consumer unit to a series of four - terminal junction boxes ,  each usually positioned roughly over the appropriate light switch ;  cables lead from each junction box to a ceiling rose and to the switch .

Loop - in wiring is more straightforward to do ,  but junction box wiring is a better system for light fittings  ( other than simple pendant lights )  and is easier to add to .

A good working knowledge of the Building Regulations requirements is therefore necessary .  The council is also empowered to ask for details of any unusual part of the project to prove compliance with the Building Regulations ,  eg special foundations for building on doubtful ground .  Another disadvantage of the Building Notice procedure is that if your work is to be financed by a <head>bank</head> or building society , then you may be required to produce some form of documentary proof that your proposal is satisfactory when you are negotiating for your loan . Your council will only provide a Building Regulations Approval Notice when Full Plans are deposited ,  so you will have to use this method .

Interviewed on the French TV channel Antenne 2 ,  Mr Benard conceded that the underestimate of the project 's  costs poses really serious problems for us ,  although he added :  There is no question of stopping work at this time .  The <head>banks</head> financing the huge project have given Eurotunnel until the end of the year to come up with an agreed costing for completion of the tunnel sufficient to enable them to release fresh loans . Their technical advisers ,  the American engineering consultancy Parsons de Leuw Cather and the German consultancy Lahmeyer International ,  estimate the cost of the project now at 8.1bn .  Eurotunnel ,  which is already in default of its credit agreement with the synidcate of 200 banks ,  is seeking an extra 1.2bn to 1.6bn on top of the 6bn raised so far .

EUROTUNNEL shares continued to plunge in London and Paris yesterday as investors took fright at indications that the spiralling costs of the Channel tunnel would not be offset by increased traffic estimates .  By the close ,  the shares had fallen a further 40p on the London market to close at 560p while they ended the day on the French bourse Fr3.6 lower at Fr59.9 amid heavy dealing in both markets .  As the shares continued to fall in the wake of Eurotunnel 's estimate that the project would cost at least 2.2bn more than forecast , Alastair Morton , co - chairman of the Anglo - French consortium was in Paris trying to persuade the French <head>banks</head> of the need for new financing . Despite the jitters the cost escalation has caused in the City ,  the French appear to be taking a more sanguine view .  At Banque Indosuez ,  one of the French underwriters of the project ,  Jean - Michel Plou ,  said the tunnel had gone too far to fail .

Despite the jitters the cost escalation has caused in the City ,  the French appear to be taking a more sanguine view .  At Banque Indosuez ,  one of the French underwriters of the project ,  Jean - Michel Plou ,  said the tunnel had gone too far to fail .  Once Eurotunnel and Transmanche Link , the consortium of firms building the tunnel , had produced more precise figures detailing the projected cost over - runs , the <head>banks</head> would be more willing to stump up the extra money , raising borrowing costs if necessary , he added . The fact that traffic estimates are not being increased to compensate for the rising construction costs is certain to raise fears that the cost of using the tunnel will be forced up by its scheduled opening in June 1993 .  Mr Morton is certain to face a City grilling on the latest cost and traffic estimates when Eurotunnel presents its interim results next Monday .

By MICHAEL PREST INTEREST rates obediently rose accross Europe yesterday after the Bundesbank ,  the West German central bank ,  increased its lending rates by one percentage point and its counterparts participated in a co - ordinated attempt to suppress the dollar and maintain exchange rate parities within the European Monetary System .  As soon as the Bundesbank announced at 2pm that its discount rate would go up to 6 per cent and its Lombard emergency funding rate to 8 per cent , the Bank of England pushed up the base lending rate of British <head>banks</head> to 15 per cent , the highest for eight years . But the carefully prepared general rise in European interest rates immediately prompted concern that it represented German worries about domestic inflation and the ability of the Bundesbank to persuade other countries to follow its policy ,  rather than an expression of the determination of the Group of Seven ,  the leading industrial nations ,  to control the dollar .  Neither the US nor Japan raised its rates .

So we 've had to do a lot of work ourselves ,  including researching carefully that we are doing something worthwhile .  This research influences the way volunteers work with victims but it is also passed on by Victim Support to other organisations that might find it useful :  it provides an input into every police training course in Britain ,  and that has led to a potential new area of work .  Former police officers now doing security jobs in shops , <head>banks</head> and offices have begun to ask Victim Support to provide help for employees who have become victims of crime through robberies or other incidents at the workplace . Next year ,  Victim Support will be publishing reports on projects covering child victims of crime ,  families of murder victims ,  racial harassment and high crime areas .  In January ,  it will launch a new court service ,  based on seven Crown courts in England ,  designed to establish the needs of victims and witnesses attending court .

Rates at the current 7.5 to 8 per cent make cash a much better alternative than it was before .  Higher European interest rates were hardly the main concern of investors in Oslo ,  home of Europe 's  second - best performing market this year .

A more positive view of the merger is that consolidation in the fragmented Norwegian banking sector is a necessity and balance sheets need to be strengthened .  DnC 's  worse - than - expected results are indicators that the Norwegian banking sector ,  if perhaps on the road to recovery ,  is not all well yet .  Norwegian <head>banks</head> were severely hit by the 1986 oil price fall . On top of that the 1987 stock market crash and a steep domestic increase in interest rates nearly nearly put paid to some of them  including DnC .  The fact that the loan losses of the banks remain heavy will force the Norwegian government to agree to the merger which otherwise might not square with its normally tough monopoly considerations .

But under the US system ,  banks stand a much greater chance of actually retaining them .  On a five - year conventional Eurobond ,  fees might be 1.25 per cent of the total issue amount ,  yet banks would be lucky to see one eighth per cent  ( and that on a good deal )  once discounts had been allowed to buyers of the bonds .  On a similar US - style deal , commissions might be only 0.325 per cent but most of that should end up with the <head>banks</head> . Which brings us to the blockbusting Italy issue arranged by Morgan Stanley ,  the US investment bank which put together the first US - style issue in Europe with an offering for New Zealand in August .

Bankers had expected that the fees for the Italy deal would be the standard 0.325 per cent .  According to reliable sources ,  however ,  Italy is paying only 0.25 per cent to its underwriters .  Bankers close to the deal say that Morgan Stanley was forced reluctantly to accept a lower commission structure because Italy was being offered this by other <head>banks</head> competing for the business . The fear now is that banks will start to compete by driving commission rates lower and lower until they are prepared to arrange issues at break - even or worse .  And this would vindicate those who believe that the market 's  ills are not going to be solved by tinkering with new issue processes ,  but rather by a drastic cutback in the overheads  ie ,  sacking people  being carried by the industry .

The Savings and Investment Bank ,  said to be owned by property developer Victor Gray ,  closed its doors in July 1982 having given massive loan facilities .  One of these was said to be a 5m loan to Raper 's  master company ,  the Hong Kong and Netherlands based Gasco Group .  This was given nine months before the <head>bank</head> collapsed and financed Gasco 's takeover of Cornish tin mining company St Piran . When the bank went into liquidation repayment was demanded and Raper immediately started a 15m action for damages ,  saying it was being called in earlier than agreed .  A long - running legal wrangle ensued with Gasco assets ultimately being frozen and a court undertaking secured from St Piran not to reduce its UK assets below 7m ,  sufficient to cover the SIB claim .

His clients had pressed ahead with the claim against his companies and Mr Ashton told the Manx judge ,  John Corrin ,  that the matter had been settled out of court and Raper was prepared to admit judgment for 11.7m ,  which would be paid into a firm of local advocates .  This ,  he said ,  would clear the way for an interim repayment to the depositors ,  and although there were some small administration problems ,  he saw no reason why this should not be done in the near future .  He said that although Raper and his henchman , Allen , had unlawfully exported large sums of money out of the UK 's jurisdiction , by the terms of the agreement the <head>bank</head> liquidators would take no voluntary part in any subsequent proceedings relating to the contempt charges . After the judgment ,  Mr Ashton was approached by a group of irate depositors and questioned about the return of their money .

Kleinwort last month reported a decline in pre - tax profits of almost 5m to 30.1m in the first half ,  though recovering from loss in the previous six months .  The group now plans to concentrate on Europe ,  the US and Japan ,  having already closed offices in Hong Kong and Singapore .  Libra Bank , the London - based consortium <head>bank</head> which trades in third world debts , plunged to a pre - tax loss of 174.6m in the first half of 1989 from profits last time of 10.9m . A 191.1m exceptional provision caused the damage ,  but lifted the bank 's  third world cover from 16 to 32 per cent .  Operating profits improved strongly from 10.9m to 16.5m .

A spokeswoman for Barclays Bank stressed that British <head>banks</head> had already cut back their lending in response to earlier warnings . The growth in lending in the year to August by Committee of Scottish and London Clearing Banks was only 27 per cent ,  and for Barclays it was only 10 per cent ,  she said .

At these levels ,  borrowers with savings or investments must be wondering whether it is worthwhile using some of their cash to pay off the mortgage in part or in full .  The net cost of borrowing for those with loans of 30,000 or less works out at 10.87 per cent for a basic rate taxpayer ,  8.7 per cent for those paying tax at 40 per cent .  With a net return of 12 per cent easily attainable from building society and <head>bank</head> high interest accounts , it is still cheaper to borrow and keep your savings on deposit . But for those with loans over 30,000 where there is no tax relief ,  it is certainly worth considering paying off some of the mortgage  -  particularly since there is no clear indication of when rates might come down. But if it is bad news for borrowers ,  investors have never had it so good .

Many financial services firms paid high prices for established brand names in the sector without considering sufficiently the nature of the markets they were entering .

In contrast ,  it will be interesting to see how far Deutsche Bank succeeds with its acquisition of Morgan Grenfell in 1989 ,  having chosen not to react immediately to the Big Bang by acquiring a merchant banking subsidiary in London in 1986 .

Of course ,  the Officer replied .  The Marine said , Get down behind that grass <head>bank</head> , Sir , and he immediately lobbed a Mills grenade into the river . The resulting explosion had the dead and stunned fish floating on the surface of the water ,  a procedure I had practised a few times in the Highlands ,  lobbing a grenade into a salmon pool ,  a dangerous procedure if caught by someone in authority .  Seems that the practice is quite legal this side of the English Channel ,  at least for hungry British troops passing through .

Large wooded areas are rare in Pembrokeshire due to the strong winds and salt spray ,  but Cwm Gwaun ,  a few miles east of Fishguard ,  is one of the notable exceptions to the rule.

This seems to me to illustrate what I would call the Breakthrough Phenomenon :  the sudden discovery that something which has been assumed to be out of the question is not out of the question at all .  Unless my recollection is at fault ,  it seems to be that two generations ago it was accepted in our society that we did not use firearms .  There was no more objective reason why firearms should not have been used in burglaries and <head>bank</head> hold - ups thirty or sixty years ago than today ; but it was n't done until it was discovered that it was done , that you could do it . There was never any problem in getting hold of the firearms ;  but nobody wanted to get hold of them ,  because it was not done to use firearms .  Then ,  after a bit ,  it becomes not something unacceptable ,  but something accepted or at least something which is demonstrated to be not out of the question .

What was interesting about that was that at the time John Brown got into financial difficulties the <head>banks</head> and institutional shareholders took a tough but very constructive view that it was worth helping the company through a reconstruction rather than forcing it into liquidation , which had been an attitude prevalent some years earlier . It was in fact my experience of working with the banks and institutions for the recapitalisation and reconstruction of John Brown which led me to think that the City is much maligned over its attitudes to industry and the accusation of short - termism is not justified .

Between 1960 and 1980 the total acreage devoted to food production in Africa increased from about 70 million hectares to about 100 million ,  or about 2.5 per cent per year ,  sufficient to sustain a population increase of about 2.7 per cent .  Yet during the same period the acreage devoted to export crops grew from only 15.5 million hectares to 17.2 million ;  of the seven major export crops the production volume of only three :  tea ,  cotton and tobacco ,  increased .  Livestock owners continued to manage their herds primarily as a means of survival and a <head>bank</head> of wealth rather than to maximize the number of animals they marketed .

A pewter tankard at his elbow ,  Wexford spent the next couple of hours studying Hatton 's  log book and Mrs Hatton 's  engagement diary .  It was the week immediately preceding May 21st which interested him. On the 22nd Hatton had paid five hundred pounds into his <head>bank</head> and two days prior to that had either been in possession of a large sum of money or confident of acquiring it , for on the 21st , a Tuesday , he had ordered his new set of teeth . Mrs Hatton 's  engagement diary was a calendar in the shape of a rectangular book .  The left - hand pages bore a coloured photograph of some English beauty spot with an appropriate verse ,  both for the picture and the time of year ,  while the right - hand pages were each divided into seven sections .

It did n't look as if Hatton had been up to much on that Monday morning in Leeds ,  but you never knew .  There was always the night between Sunday and Monday to be considered .  For all Wexford knew or could remember there might have been a <head>bank</head> robbery in that city at that time . It would have to be checked .  He wondered why the Fanshawe business kept intruding and upsetting his concentration ,  and then suddenly he knew .

As each group of rigs arrived they moved quietly on to the sloping cobbled ramp ,  which in times past had been used by a civilian ferry ,  and with a hiss of hydraulics opened out .  The crew ,  moving rapidly yet almost soundlessly ,  carried out the few jobs required to convert the land vehicle to a boat ,  and within seconds the rigs slid rapidly into the dark water and powered away to swing out  their ramps and couple together in twos and threes .  Simultaneously the men of the <head>bank</head> support section tugged and pulled their steel wire ropes and tirfor winches into place , to provide anchorages from which to hold the ends of the bridge in the correct depth of water for loading . Within a few minutes all the rigs had arrived and splashed in ,  and the earlier arrivals which had formed two -  and three - rig rafts were crabbing across the river and pushing upstream to the bridge centreline .  The crane ratchets of the later arrivals could still be heard clearly as their crews outramped ,  and rising bow waves could be spotted as an occasional laggard powered upstream to its proper place in the echelon .

Both the two - rig landing bays had moved into the banks on the centreline ,  and their combined crews ,  assisted by the ubiquitous bank support section ,  had connected the anchor ropes and the short ramp sections ,  Which were added to the main ramps to allow traffic easy access to the bridge .  The Troop Staff Sergeant detailed to supervise the construction was insistently calling the rafts into the head of the bridge ,  where they coupled on with remarkable rapidity .  The end of the bridge was clearly visible as it grew out of the far <head>bank</head> , and needed only a couple of rafts to make it complete . At that moment the men detailed as River Watchers radioed that a fast - moving vessel was coming downstream ,  and the Safety Officer ,  not at all sure of the newcomer 's  identity or intentions ,  fired an illuminating parachute flare over the nearly complete bridge to warn of the obstruction across its bows .  The Wasserschutz Polizei ,   or River Police launch ,  Whose arrival had been expected much earlier ,  turned on its blue flashing light and jauntily turned to take station upstream ,  in order to intercept any barge or ship choosing to ignore the river closure order which had been imposed by the river authorities for the night .

The bridge was complete ,  the air blowers on each rig whined as the remaining air bags were inflated for additional buoyancy ,  and footwalk posts and ropes were installed .  A few last checks by the Bridge Commander ,  and it was declared ready for traffic ,  seven minutes ahead of time .  The first vehicles loomed out of the darkness on the south <head>bank</head> , driving only on convoy lights with each one following the barely seen , under - chassis - mounted , single White light of the one in front . Rig Commanders stationed on the inshore ramp guided the drivers on with brief flashes of their green lights ,  and the convoy drove steadily across .  The bridge was held against the current by the engine power of twenty - eight port engines ,  finely adjusted by the pilots on their stands above the rig cabs .

The street was soon cleared and an incident control point was set up. The RUC arrived ,  a sergeant in command .  The patrol commander had just finished briefing the police on the situation when one of the patrol shouted , There 's someone in the <head>bank</head> . The patrol gave cover as the police approached the building .  Just at that moment a man staggered out of the door of the bank ;  when he saw the tableau of police and soldiers in front of him ,  he threw his arms up in the air .

The RUC sergeant went forward and arrested the man ,  who turned out to be the bank security guard who was rather the worse for drink ,  and had forgotten to lock the door !  The whole incident was over within an hour and the patrol was able to return to their base .
