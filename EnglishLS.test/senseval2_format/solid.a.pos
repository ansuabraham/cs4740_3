The writer is able to measure artists not only against each other but also against standards of technical achievement .  Here is a passage from a classic work on etching and engraving ,  about Drer :  He was <head>solid</head> , scientific , conscious in all his creating , learning his art from masters who were still in the youth of artistic development , his whole work shows a progress towards an ideal which the trammels of Gothic tradition never left him free to attain without a struggle . By the very energy spent in its realisation ,  his accomplishment is all the more intense in its expression .  He recognised the truest limits of the medium in which he worked ,  never allowed technical virtuosity to have the better of the central aim of significant composition ,  and established a balanced style which remains the most perfect model of the line - engraver 's  art .

He makes a particular point of technique .  In the chapter on technique the author describes the process of carving a figure from a wood with particular properties .  First the hard heartwood was removed , making the intended figure hollow at the back ; the sculptor avoided <head>solid</head> masses , unstable in wood ( though preferred by sculptors in a material like sandstone ) ; finally in the carving , forms were decided partly to avoid the hazards of the sapwood shrinking and splitting . Limewood is contrasted with oak ,  and the chapter finishes :  The properties of the material made limewood sculpture a special medium .

It showed itself to have a horror of socialism already in the nineteenth century .  But its opposition also had a base in the property - owning ,  rural peasantry ,  and middle - classes ,  who had in the nineteenth century paid a heavy price for their liberation from oppression and whose status became rooted in their property ,  land ,  and livestock .  Their attitudes were shared by their priest - sons , who in their turn were supported by Rome , whose <head>solid</head> opposition to socialism until the 1960s was very clear ( e.g. Pope Leo XIII , 1903 ) . From 1911 to 1914 ,  the Irish high clergy made successive attacks on the trade union movement and on socialism .  Rumpf and Hepburn  ( 1977 )  view the activity of the church during this period as quite decisive in limiting the appeal of socialism for the Irish subordinate classes until the 1950s .

With the emergence of the statelet in 1922 ,  covenant politics was subordinated to the Stormont alliance only to re - emerge after Stormont 's  collapse in 1972 .  In 1971 ,  a new covenant was signed by over half a million men and women ,  committing protestants to a renewal of the covenant political ideal .  Miller ( 1978 ) suggests that the contractarian element was no longer ever so <head>solid</head> . Be that as it may ,  it may turn out that the preparedness not to acquiesce in any all - Ireland solution is decidedly stronger than most commentators until recently were prepared to accept ,  except for the work of Bew ,  Gibbon ,  and Patterson .   Thus ,  protestant loyalists fight incorporation into a united Ireland for the reason that their perception of protestantism and their values of polity contain a powerful rejection of catholic monopoly ,  which they identify with catholicism tout court  .

They get far more than they bargain for .  ( Grillo 1980 :  3 )  In effect , the insider who reveals the structural formations of a system of power inverts that power and the revelation creates a situation where elements of anti - structure ( Turner 1969 , 1974 ) now present a version of how things might be constituted ; and what has been seen as <head>solid</head> reality begins to be identified as only one social possibility . In this observing participation ,  the thick description which Geertz  ( 1975 )  argued for comes hurtling at the ethnographer ,  so that the classic use of an anthropological informant is hardly necessary .  Rather it will be a case of the researcher finding a means of recording and sorting the mass of detail which continuously bombards him and presents him with the lateral possibilities which make the discipline potentially dangerous .

In 1990 ,  over 5,000 school teams competed in the various Midland Bank sponsored national schools competitions and figures received so far suggest even more in 1991 .  The development of a Tennis Teachers Course offers help to the non - coach teacher ,  and the inauguration of County Schools Tennis Associations  ( there are now 39 )  has enabled locally based courses to be set up. We have prepared a wide - ranging study kit for GCSE , which will be available next term , and preparations are in hand for a scheme to construct <head>solid</head> links between schools and their local tennis club . Perhaps most significant of all is the launch of the National Schools Coaching Programme .  This is being run as a pilot scheme in three counties this year ,  and will go nationwide as soon as a sponsor can be found .

If the ribs  ( sides )  are thinner ,  as suggested  ( about 1.5mm )  hot bending will not be necessary and a better shape can be achieved by the use of a simple jig to hold the ribs while the glue dries .  The use of small glue blocks along the inside of the joint is also a good idea .  If the instrument is to be resonant the apparently <head>solid</head> finger board needs to be hollowed out from underneath , leaving about 6mm of wood top and sides and openings cut through the soundboard ( face ) to link this space to the interior of the instrument . If you are using guitar machine heads  ( far more easily adjusted than pegs ,  which also require special tools to fit them accurately )  it is more convenient to modify the shape of the head and fit them only on the left  ( if you are right - handed )  in the manner of Fender guitars .  If you want symmetry make sure you get the right number of left or right - handed machines .

Most bandsaws ,  for example ,  have a table considerably above the common machine table height which may enable you to cast long jobs above other machines .  Most planer - thicknessers have a thicknessing table below common machine height ,  so position your thicknesser very carefully .  For instance , we know in our workshop if you want to plane and thickness timber for a <head>solid</head> wood dining table that is longer than 10 feet , we have got to do it somewhere else . When it comes to choosing which machine to buy I would suspect that our requirements would be rather different from your own .  This a busy commercial workshop .

Each machine is probably used by half a dozen different people every day .  Some of them may be less careful with it than others so we need machines that can take a battering .  Not , I hope , that ny of my staff or students would batter any of my old ladies but my machines have to be very <head>solid</head> and reliable . A workshop with one machinist who carefully adjusts and sets the machine up and leaves it that way at the end of the job is not necessarily going to need the heaviest equipment .  I know it is a terribly sexist remark but I do think of the machines in our first workshop as old ladies .

Your questions Moveable tops Q We constantly read that when making table tops and the like from <head>solid</head> timber , one should not fix finishing pieces across the end - grain because the greater lateral expansion across the grain will break the glue joint eventually . Yet many of the custom designed pieces we see have such end pieces ,  often an integral part of the design .  Are there ways around the problem which are not generally discussed ,  and is the problem non - existent with some timbers ?

This article suggests that there masses of superb routes in the VS to E1 range on the crags of Southern France  even on the most illustrious and intimidating of them .  Excellent climbing can be combined with a family holiday in beautiful surroundings ,  with a virtual guarantee of sunshine .  Remember these routes are all on limestone , which rarely gives good routes at less than VS , but a line of bolts , ending at a firmly anchored chain , up dry and <head>solid</head> rock , means that a much bolder approach can be adopted than on the polished , easier routes of Stoney or the vertical scree of Swanage . Climbing outside the usual circuit of The Pass ,  The Lakes ,  Stanage etc can be a real boost to your enjoyment and ,  I think ,  to your performance .  It is difficult to equate French and British grades .

The wedge is retracted when the device is placed and then released .  When fallen on ,  the wedge is retained in the groove and forced against the nut and up the incline .  But , the width of the crack prevents this and the nut remains <head>solid</head> . The wires are soldered into the nut and the device appears well engineered .  One benefit of this over similar units is that the groove retains the semi - circular wedge ,  so it is hard to separate this moveable part from the nut .

The upstairs lighting circuit is laid out on the floor of the loft ,  taking care not  to put it under any loft insulation  ( where it could overheat )  ,  and not to put junction boxes where they could be damaged by careless feet .  The downstairs lighting circuit is run under the first - floor floorboards ,  with cables preferably threaded through holes drilled in the centre of joists ,  or clipped to the sides of the joists .  To run cable down to light switches or to wall lights , it will usually be necessary to chase slots in <head>solid</head> walls , though if you are rewiring a house which was originally wired in metal conduit , you may be able to use the existing conduit buried in the plaster leading to light switches to feed the cable down. Chasing solid walls is done with a bolster chisel and club hammer ,  and it is important to keep the cables vertical so that you know where they are .  Ideally ,  cables should be covered with metal half - channel before the plaster is made good with filler or a d - i - y plaster :  you will ,  of course ,  have to redecorate the wall afterwards .

What size should battens for supporting cladding be ,  and how are they fixed ?   Wall battens are usually 38119mm ,  or 5025mm in cross - section ,  and should be fixed to the walls either with masonry nails or with non - rusting screws driven into wallplugs .  Nails should penetrate about 10mm into <head>solid</head> masonry and should not be driven into mortar joints . If you are fixing battens over existing rendering make sure they are long enough to give adequate penetration into the brickwork or blockwork beneath .  While cladding can be fixed directly to existing masonry walls ,  it is good practice to cover them with waterproof building paper first to prevent any moisture that gets behind the cladding from penetrating the wall itself .

No one ,  he thinks ,  who is unfamiliar with Pound 's  P.T .  Barnumising for the visual arts will know what to make of it .

No one who reads the three <head>solid</head> essays in what is described as the catalogue of the exhibition ( though it is n't quite that ) can think that Barnumising in any way describes Pound 's ardent response to painting and sculpture , photography and architecture , first in London 19081920 , then in Paris 19201925 , and thereafter in Italy . Carpenter ,  predictably ,  finds the three essayists  Richard Humphreys ,  John Alexander and Peter Robinson  taking a rather solemn approach to the whole thing ;  whereas ,  he assures us ,  Pound 's  exertions on behalf of these arts partook more than a little of the amiable joke .  Before it is through ,  Pound 's  centenary year will bring on indigestion in even the most devoted Poundians .

Coming between the poetic neo - romanticism of the war years and the potentially overwhelming influence of American abstraction ,  theirs was a quiet but genuinely felt and observed art which shows its strength by continuing to flourish in its unsensational way .  McCall was happiest working on a small intimate scale ,  dealing with the domestic interior and the urban scene .  He used a <head>solid</head> rich surface of paint and liked the simplified shapes produced by artificial lighting . In his person he matched his art perfectly :  he was distinguished in appearance ,  erect in bearing and with a certain unselfconscious ,  slightly old - fashioned ,  courtesy .  Apparently preferring silence to chatter ,  in company he would let the froth bubble around him yet then produce a wry ,  always shrewd ,  comment .

What makes a successful indie label ?  Everyone has their own idea but history shows that certain elements are essential to the long term success of an indie .  It may take several releases and many months before the company starts to see a return on its investments , so it is essential for an indie to have a relatively <head>solid</head> financial base to see it through the difficult early stages and to sustain the levels of promotion until an act on the label breaks . some of the most successful of the small indies have achieved success largely by catering for specialist markets  ( generally ignored by the majors )  and developing a good reputation for its product with the fans of particular styles ,  so much so that some indie labels enjoy instant sales of a new release on the strength of the quality of their past product .  This is called niche marketing which is a familiar concept in all forms of retailing .

Later there were bands like The Vibrators ,  The Stranglers and The Hammersmith Gorillas ,  horrors one and all ,  but pride of place in the pub rock pantheon went to Wilko Johnson 's  Dr Feelgood and the wonderfully esoteric Kilburn And The High Roads ,  featuring Ian Dury and kitted out courtesy of Let It Rock .
