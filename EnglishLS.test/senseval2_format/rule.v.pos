There are many shifting thoughts to be considered in this extract ,  and there is colour too ;  you need to convey the spurts of energy vocally .  The Apple Cart by George Bernard Shaw The play is a fable , of an England <head>ruled</head> over by King Magnus . Orinthia is his mistress and this speech is taken from an amusing scene between Orinthia and Magnus .  Orinthia replies to Magnus 's  words ,  It must be magnificent to have the consciousness of a goddess without ever doing anything to justify it .

This follows representations by the British Hotels ,  Restaurants and Caterers Association  ( BHRCA )  which learnt of the proposed change in May .  Customs  Excise introduced the changes ,  which will be back - dated to 1 July ,  after it found hotels had been treating the supply of packed lunches to guests as zero - rated  (  Caterer  ,  27 June3 July )  .  It <head>ruled</head> that packed lunches are supplied in the course of catering and are liable for the 17.5 % standard rating of VAT . The back dating of all VAT not charged on packed lunches could lead to hefty bills for hoteliers .  When VAT was introduced on hot takeaway food in 1987 ,  amendments to the Finance Act were made after Parliamentary consultation .

There we find similar bodily constructs built up as series of organizing principles ,  so that the other regiment or unit is perceived to operate in some kind of polluted time and space ,  and its aberrant nuances of uniform styling used as a marker of significant difference .  The police also use concepts of a disciplined body in their dealings to effect the capture of the local villains  ( or prigs )  .  In any public confrontation a quick assessment and early resolution is the order of the day , for on the streets pragmatism always <head>rules</head> and real polises set out immediately to fix their adversaries by using deeply imbued constructs relating to time and space . Always the disorderly acts of the prig must be stopped ,  curtailed ,  arrested ,  disciplined ,  and contained ;  and in pursuit of a docile body the law inevitably seeks to negate ,  constrain ,  prevent ,  and deny movement .  For the legal process demands that incidents and occurrences be ideally fixed in time and space .

In an interview with Mark Paytress in 1988 Leonard stated that by the age of six he was already acquainted with rudimentary Judaism and recalled being deeply touched by the stirring language and imagery of the Bible  -  in English and Hebrew .  Each day after school he would wend his way to the synagogue for instruction in the sacred scriptures ,  the stories and history of his people ,  which reached its climax in 1946 ,  when Leonard was made A son of the law. All hell rules over the man who is angry , says the Talmud , and by September 1939 , when Leonard was beginning to come to terms with the thresholds of life 's reality , hell was <head>ruling</head> the world , or at least appeared to be . War had been declared ,  and the fate of Czechoslovakia ,  Austria and Poland was sealed ,  as it would be for several other countries .  It would be six years before that anger would begin to subside ,  six years of unspeakable anguish for those of Hebrew persuasion ,  when unbelievable monstrosities would be inflicted on them ,  by the end of which half of the world 's  Jewry had been murdered .

From Dame MARY DONALDSON ,  GBE THE incineration of PCBs requires a furnace which will hold the material at 1,100C for at least two seconds ,  in the presence of plenty of oxygen .

Her Majesty 's  Inspectorate of Pollution is now the custodian of national standards on emissions from such plants ,  of which Britain currently has three .  Rechem can take solid and liquid wastes contaminated with PCBs at its plant at Pontypool  ( 30,000 tonnes a year )  ,  and liquid wastes  ( 20,000 tonnes a year )  at its plant at Fawley ,  near Southampton .

Right to censure textbooks is upheld From DAVID POWERS in Tokyo A TOKYO court <head>ruled</head> yesterday that the Japanese Education Ministry was within its rights to ban a textbook which detailed Japanese war atrocities , even though the court could n't fault any of the assertions made by the author . What made the ruling even more surprising was that the Japanese government had pledged to correct bias in school textbooks after South Korea and China lodged diplomatic protests in 1982 ,  when the book was originally banned .  The reason given for the ban was that Professor Saburo Ienaga ,  a noted historian ,  had refused to strike out a reference in his book to bacteriological and other experiments carried out on Chinese prisoners of war by the now - defunct Imperial Army .

I cannot see that one voting system is intrinsically more fair than another .  It is not fair ,  perhaps ,  that with 23 per cent of the vote the Alliance should have won only 3 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons .  But nor is it fair that with 6 or 7 per cent of the vote , the West German liberals should be the sole arbiters of who <head>rules</head> in Bonn . The case for electoral reform is best discussed in terms of the question :  what kind of political system do we want ?  Our electoral system strongly favours two - party government ;  other people 's  systems ,  in varying degree proportionate ,  result in coalitions of a usually centrist tinge .

Friends of Knighton believe he is close to putting together a deal which would see at least some of the shares resold within four months of a take - over .

Earlier , Mr Justice Judge had <head>ruled</head> in the Manchester High Court that the terms of a temporary injunction be lifted , allowing him to show financial details of the club to his advisers . The suit had been brought by Martin Edwards ,  the United chairman and controlling shareholder ,  who has agreed to sell his 50.6 per cent holding to Knighton for 10m .  The Court adjourned the matter until Thursday ,  but it is hoped by both parties that by then the current uncertainty and speculation concerning the future of Manchester will have been resolved .

It might seem that so artificial a superiority was certain to prove as transient as the hegemonies that it had replaced ,  although those in whose hands power lay were for the most part undaunted by the new challenges to Britain 's  position that they sensed They took it for granted that the international world was one of competing powers and that their duty was to make the most of whatever assets were available to them .
