Reality does not discuss ,  it simply is .  The independence of the poem provided Jaromil with a marvellous world of concealment ,  the possibility of a second  existence .  Jaromil has discovered that writing can be what reading has familiarly been for the ordinary person : an escape , a <head>shelter</head> , a door to the alternative self . Much later we read :  Everything seemed to indicate that Jaromil 's  enormous yearning for newness  ( the religion of the New )  was only the disguised longing of a virginal youth for the unimaginable experience of the sex act .

Weather watch Guard against the harmful effects of extreme weather by watering plants before drought becomes critical ,  and making sure excessive rainfall can drain away freely .  Site is as important as soil , for plants that prefer full sun , shade or <head>shelter</head> may not thrive if planted in the wrong place , and are then more likely to succumb . A regular walk around the garden to make sure everything is growing healthily is the simplest precaution of all ,  often revealing preliminary signs of trouble .  In addition to maintaining positive plant health ,  there are several ways to avoid the probability of serious pest attacks ,  or at least lessen their impact ,  which in turn will cut down on the need to apply pesticides .

What the paper scathingly called the story of the refugees had been whipped up by a noisy propaganda campaign dripping with chauvinism and nationalism .  And behind the West German media stood the country 's  politicians ,  nursing illusions about the recreation of a new German Reich with the pre - war frontiers of 1937 .  Such language is infinitely more virulent that anything emanating from the Soviet foreign ministry after the deal four days ago between Bonn and East Berlin , which allowed some some 5,000 East Germans who had taken <head>shelter</head> in the two embassies to leave unmolested for the West . Hitherto its spokesmen have insisted that the affair was essentially one for East Germany to settle ,  albeit urging that West Germany must operate its embassies abroad in conformity with standard international practice .  To an extent ,  the anger is to be expected from a newspaper which has become a strident mouthpiece of conservative elements in the Kremlin leadership .

Due to the incompetence of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Ethiopia ,  their condition rapidly deteriorated .

The distribution of food , water and <head>shelter</head> was chaotic . Some refugees managed to obtain extra ration cards ,  and at the Harshin and Hartishek camps food repeatedly ran out before everyone had received their ration .  There were several riots ,  and local Ethiopian troops opened fire more than once to quell the angry refugees .

The village is almost completely destroyed ,  which is not surprising ,  due to the bombardments that it has been subjected to since 6th June by British artillery and naval guns .

By the number of enemy dead lying about the fields and approaches to the village , the British attacks have finally forced them to move out , taking <head>shelter</head> in a slit trench during a German mortar attack , everyone keeping their heads down.

In harbour the rig is usually opened out to its full water width of six metres ,  and the four independently suspended wheels can be retracted into the main hull ,  so that it appears to squat on the ground .

It also has the added advantage that , by spreading a canopy over the on - board crane , a <head>shelter</head> can be made in which to sleep and cook when in harbour . As the afternoon turned into a slightly cooler early evening ,  each crew methodically checked over their rig .

For this reason ,  many of these structures have disappeared .  The number and size of the buildings of the farmstead was affected not only by the size of the farm but also by the type of farming practised .  On an arable farm with only a few cattle kept to make manure , little provision would be made for these animals , but there would be one or more barns , stables and <head>shelters</head> for carts . On a mixed farm ,  there would be a larger number of buildings for cattle ,  while on a pastoral farm the reduced need for waggon horses caused the stables to be small and there would be little accommodation for crops .  It is interesting to note that sheep had almost no effect on the form of the farmstead as buildings were very rarely provided for them .

Sociologists agree that economic integration of the refugees poses a minor problem compared with the social aspect .

The two rode about the parish together ,  and after a second visit Mr Brown produced a planting plan and a bill for 73.10s .

The new farmsteads were being built at the same time , set snugly into <head>shelter</head> belts of oak , beech and elm , nursed up by Scots pines . Sir Christopher designed most of the buildings himself ,  but left the design of The Castle ,  to the terrifically fashionable architect John Carr of York ,  who had been taken up by the Yorkshire gentry after his triumph with the design for the grandstand on the racecourse at Knavesmire .  The Castle was built as an eye catcher ,  to be glimpsed from the library window of Sledmere ,  as though some forgotten castle had been crumbling in its wood for centuries .

There is a fantastic intensity and wildness ,  almost savagery ,  in the landscapes of Spain ,  and Catalonia ,  delivered from the Arabs by Charlemagne ,  is no exception .  I travelled among grotesque rock formations ,  past gorges and canyons ,  weird spectres of fanes and fortresses on distant isolated heights ,  small villages strung along spines of haggard cliffs .

The piercing brilliance of the late afternoon sunlight seems to intensify the surrealism of the constantly changing scenery .

Small patches of forestry plantation darkened the slopes of some hills .

Bosnia 's  second city ,  Mostar ,  was the scene of street fighting and artillery battles between the Yugoslav army and the Croatian and Muslim defenders .

For the second day Yugoslav jets attacked Croat villages to the east of Mostar ,  which the Yugoslav army claimed were being used to launch raids on its garrisons .  Serbian paramilitary groups ,  with Yugoslav tanks based in Knin ,  claimed to have recaptured the predominantly Serbian town of Kupres .

Nevertheless ,  it is also clear that there is scope for increasing the agricultural production of the crofts .  Some of us felt that more attention could be paid to this aspect ,  particularly in order to obtain a greater economic return for the heavy expenditure on government assistance .  The principal way in which the agricultural production of the crofts has been increased is through the improvement of pasture by fencing , planting <head>shelter</head> - belts , liming ( usually with shell sand ) , fertilizing and surface seeding . Although such improvement has been vigorously promoted by the North of Scotland College of Agriculture  ( which is responsible for agricultural extension and training in the area )  ,  the response has ,  after some initial enthusiasm ,  been extremely disappointing .  By 1979 only about 6,000 ha in Lewis and Harris  ( no more than 4 %  of the total common grazing )  had been the subject of the grants available under the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme .

The indexes ,  in Latin and English ,  are followed by seven practical lists ,  similar to those in the catalogues of many leading nurserymen today and they can still be consulted to advantage .  The author directs attention to the all - important consideration of scale :  We often see some of the smallest growing shrubs placed where the largest trees should have been planted .  The first list deals with hardy , deciduous trees and shrubs thriving in this country without <head>shelter</head> and has a key to their height , flowers and scent . Miller liked his ground cover to be permanent and he has not included any of the undershrubs ,  which are of short duration ,  such as Southernwood ,  Rosemary ,  Lavender ,  Lavender Cotton ,  etc. because whenever these decay ,  they occasion gaps in the plantation .  Next he grouped the climbing ,    shrubby plants needing support or fastening and these are followed by hardy evergreen trees and shrubs .

PROBLEMS OF SHELTER The impact of the migrants has varied from country to country ,  but two areas which stand out as having been profoundly affected throughout the continent are housing and employment .  Initially it was the basic problem of <head>shelter</head> that attracted social scientists , with the result that the main concern was for the home environment of the poor . The rapidly increasing urban population has placed an impossible strain on the provision of housing .  The housing deficit in Mexico is about 4 million units ,  which means that about 30 per cent of the population is in need of housing  ( Hurtado 1986 )  .

The turner thesis has been criticised by Marxists for overemphasising the differences between the slum dwellers and the squatters .  They argue that the differential in living standards between the two groups is minimal and to see this as social mobility is to detract attention from the important fact that they are all part of the large urban poor whose poverty is due to the wider social formation and ,  in particular ,  the capitalist mode of production .  Self - help schemes relieve the state of the immediate necessity of providing housing and offer a cheap source of <head>shelter</head> , thus making it possible for the poor to survive on very low incomes ( Burgess 1978 ) . The criticisms of both marginality and the Turner thesis have suggested that the problems of spontaneous housing cannot be fully understood without some reference to the wider society .  The initial founding of a squatter settlement is ,  itself ,  an illegal act and ,  therefore ,  a challenge to authority .

There are many types of bin sold to keep the compost area tidy and clean ,  or you can make your own .  An activator may be used to speed up the process but certain basic principles should be borne in mind .  First , the layers of plant refuse should be 6to 12 in depth ; second , the heap should have some <head>shelter</head> if possible from sun and wind , to prevent drying - out and loss of heat ; third , a supply of nitrogen can be incorporated in alternate layers . If the compost is intended for your vegetable garden ,  you can use hydrated lime in the alternate layers ,  but beware of this if you plan to use the compost on rhododendrons ,  azaleas or other lime - hating plants .  If turned ,  two or three times ,  the heap will decompose without getting too hot or becoming mildewed .

It is a strongly rural range of occupations ,  and it is especially striking how few were regular manual employees .  Most were casual or self - employed workers who could not be made to retire ,  and many were also small property - holders  an important factor which also made their position stronger for continuing at work .  One old couple who were village publicans used their house as a <head>shelter</head> for a very composite family which included a daughter who did the pub cooking , a brother , and a son who used two rooms as his tailor 's shop . Even two of the farmhands rented a smallholding where they could grow vegetables and keep cows ,  pigs ,  and poultry ;  while another was also a carter .  Because they continued to be economically independent ,  these working older people ,  both men and women ,  were often remembered as strong characters ,  like the Lancashire shopkeeping grandmother ,  a powerful personality who was without any doubt boss of the concern ,  or the old North Welsh woman who was doing all the cobbling for the neighbours in Berthengam ,  and they were done by her well .

Many of them were possible only if the NILP got control of Stormont and were propaganda points in its ideological war against the doctrines of Orange and Green .

The great park at Petworth was described by Arthur Young in 1793 as previously consisting only of bushes ,  furze ,  some timber and rubbish of no kind of use .  Despite ploughing , despite the ravages of age and elm disease on park trees , the essential features of parks often survive namely , the encircling <head>shelter</head> belts and individual clumps of trees , and the lakes . As has been made clear in the discussion of country houses ,  parks and the houses that stand within them are inseparable .

The importance of grazing both cows and sheep over the same land  ( either together or in succession )  ,  both for the good of the sward and the health of the livestock ,  is explained at the beginning of Chapter 6 .  Set stocking ,  in which animals are given free range over a relatively large area and not moved regularly ,  is the most labour - saving system of grazing .  The provision of water may well be easier and <head>shelter</head> in foul weather more readily available somewhere in a large area than in a small paddock or strip . The main disadvantages of set stocking are the buildup of intestinal worms and the growth of tussocks of coarse ,  unpalatable grass where animals have dunged .  Paddock grazing ,  in which the grassland is divided into small paddocks ,  grazed hard for a short period and then rested for up to three weeks ,  is a very good system for the control of parasite worms ,  the life cycle of which is broken during the rest periods .

Your canvas <head>shelter</head> has no defence against the midge , and the only course of action is to spray the inside of the tent with the strongest insect repellent on the market , preferably something banned in all other European countries , and then dive into the sleeping - bag and cover your head , trying hard not to inhale the toxic gases . Of course you will wake up in the morning with a nervous disorder and a slightly lower IQ ,  but at least you wo n't have any itchy red lumps .

Nearer our own time ,  in 1830 ,  when the extensive manor of Ingleton changed hands ,  the new owner had a tower intended as a hospice erected on the summit ,  made from stone pillaged from the wall and the foundations of the huts .  The edifice was short lived :  on the day of the opening ceremony ,  the assembled crowd of visitors got out of control during the festivities and dismantled the building ,  reducing it to the great heap of stones to be seen today .  Nearby , a wall <head>shelter</head> intended as a wind break , was fitted with a view indicator in 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Elizabeth II . The summit is 2373 feet above the sea ,  not a great altitude ,  but to the many pilgrims who climb to it time and time again ,  it is a stepping stone to heaven .   For me and the growing number of cavers and potholers ,  the fascination of Ingleborough is centred on the band of limestone at and below mid - height .

Here the magnificent oaks and beeches are twice graced by their reflections in the still waters of the lake .   Past the end of the lake a limestone grotto is reached , affording <head>shelter</head> but not now maintained in pristine condition . Beyond ,  where the private grounds are left ,  a track from Clapdale Farm is joined and the walk continues in a more open environment along the valley of Clapham Beck to the massive limestone cliff where Ingleborough Cave ,  sometimes called Clapham Cave ,  opens to daylight .  This is a show cave ,  open to the public when a guide is in attendance ;  the charge for admittance is rewarded by a splendid display of natural carvings and formations and many named features .

BUS SHELTER PLAN ROPLEY residents could soon benefit from a new bus shelter on the A31 at Darvill Road .  Following a request at the annual parish meeting , councillors have agreed to look into the cost of providing a <head>shelter</head> to be sited on an existing area of hard standing . Another matter raised by the public highlighted the problem of double parking outside the coffee room by the church .  It was hoped that ,  with more publicity ,  people would leave their cars at the village hall instead and walk .

OMO 1 was passed by the Railway Inspector in April 1972 ,  and after trial runs on the Promenade during the season ,  went into service on the Fleetwood route that winter .  The public were prepared for the change by an illustrated leaflet ,  and the cars carried illuminated Pay As You Enter  signs .  All <head>shelters</head> had to be altered so that queues faced the trams , new signs were erected and the traditional round stop - signs disappeared . No less than 170 conductor - posts were saved by the introduction of one - man buses and trams between 1969 and 1976 ,  but the tramway was saved too !  Technical improvements to the riding qualities of the OMO cars ,  followed the replacement of the traditional steel springs by rubber suspension .

The eldest Miss Fricker never forgot the arrival of the travel - weary student whose brilliant reputation had gone so powerfully before him. Brown as a berry ,  his clothes worn out ,  and his hair in need of cutting ,  he appeared before them as a dreadful figure ,  though one whose torrential eloquence was unabated .  Lovell gave Coleridge food that night , but not <head>shelter</head> , and in the days that followed was responsible with Southey for introducing him to a city strong in religious dissent and political radicalism . One meeting of particular significance was with a young dissenting bookseller called Joseph Cottle ,  whose shop stood at the corner of Corn Street and High Street ,  a few yards from Southey 's  birthplace .  Cottle ,  who four years later was to publish the Lyrical Ballads  and in old age produced his garrulous and unreliable Reminiscences  ,  immediately saw in Coleridge the signs of commanding genius ,  but reserved for Southey 's  great suavity of manners his more enthusiastic praise .

During one excursion which probably occurred at this time Tom Poole took his friends to Walford 's  Gibbet on the Quantock slopes between Holford and Stowey ,  and there recounted John Walford 's  tragic history .  Walford ,  a charcoal - burner who had spent his solitary life in a woodland shelter built of poles and turf ,  was remembered by Tom Poole as a man remarkable for good temper and generosity ,  but one who also possessed ardent feelings and strong passions .  He was deeply in love with an Over Stowey woman called Ann Rice , but was forced into marriage to a half - mad girl who had visited him at his <head>shelter</head> and who bore him two illegitimate children . They married in June 1789 ,  and a month later ,  in despair and rage ,  he murdered her as they walked in the darkness to the Castle of Comfort Inn .  He was soon arrested ,  largely through the efforts of Tom Poole 's  father ,  and was sentenced to be hanged in chains .

It sounded the same as the English siren except that it was slower .  We went down into the station shelter and I experienced the familiar claustrophobic sensation of waiting for something to happen .  The <head>shelter</head> was clean and well built . Civilians sat on benches joking and playing cards and rocking screaming babies to sleep .  It was obvious that the air raid siren had never been much more to them than a bore .

The discovery in Charlie 's  garden on that May morning fourteen years ago was just another reminder of the layers  the heritage  we all dwell upon yet seem able to ignore with such ease .  The water - keeper escorted me back up the lane .  It is said to be an overcoat warmer in the valley , but <head>shelter</head> from the north is no compensation for the deep - freeze effect as the frosts drain down to the river . Spring ,  our particular spring ,  is always late and something to be talked about .  Fred  as the skeleton was later named  was found in May ,  with the willows by the bank at their greenest and  the wild fowl at their most excited .

In Kuwait ,  Al - Nakshabandi and El - Robee  ( 1988 )  have shown that aeolian deposition has resulted in decreased productivity or complete failure of many agricultural enterprises .  In contrast to the Sahel zone which is classified as semi - arid ,  Kuwait is arid  (  Desertification Map of the World  ,  FAO/Unesco 1977 )  so it is to be expected that desertification is a prominent problem and a major agent of environmental change .  In the Abdaly region of northern Kuwait there are some 156 farms which are separated by desert and thus exposed to sandstorms , where metal wind - breaks and <head>shelter</head> - belts have not prevented sand encroachment , largely as Al - Nakshabandi and El - Robee have suggested , due to poor management . Similar problems have occurred in the Al - Wafra region in the south of Kuwait ,  where desert encroachment has led to the abandonment of farms .  Here the annual rate of sand encroachment is  which is in excess of the average annual rate of sand encroachment of   ( Khalaf 1989 )  .

Songqiao  ( 1988 )  describes that of the Hexi corridor which is situated between the Mongolian and Tibetan plateaux and which has a long history of cultivation based on irrigation .  Moreover ,  Kebin and Kaiguo  ( 1989 )  describe the measures suggested by the Project of Protective Forest System which was approved by the government in 1978 to improve conditions in northern China .  Between 1978 and 1985 some 5.3 10 6 ha were planted with trees , shrubs and herbs , including a sand - fixation forest belt of 700 000 ha , another 700 000 ha of <head>shelter</head> - belts for arable land and 170 000 ha of shelter - belts for pasture . Eventually some 8  106 ha will be planted to constitute the Green Great Wall .  Kebin and Kaiguo also report that grazing and wood removal for firewood are prohibited near oases and villages and that these measures ,  plus tree planting and irrigation ,  have been effective in reclaiming parts of Gansu Province .

And this is a lifelong process ;  it can continue even when all other ambitions ,  for riches ,  power and the rest ,  have faded .  At first the growth of a child is dictated by biological needs .  He seeks safety and warmth and <head>shelter</head> and food . Once he is assured of these ,  other needs arise .  He now wants the love of his parents and others of his kinship .

Psychedelic green moss and bright yellow rhododendron leaves submerged in pools like goldfish reminded me of Aros on Mull .  A tiger ,  benign ,  would be pleasant to meet .  A rotting rustic hut gave <head>shelter</head> from the monsoon and there I decided to forget about JTR 's sketches at the sheep farm by the Laddie Burn many a mile on . Standing in the Invergarry pub with Scotch broth and whisky ,  I learned the sheep farm and shepherds were no more .  Just forestry .

By spring of the following year ,  two - thirds of the village had died from exposure and hunger .   From that time ,  they called Richard Carew The Exterminator .  He had the great oak forest beyond the river cut down , ensuring that never again would it provide <head>shelter</head> for outlaw or wolf . The clearance made Richard a very rich man. Timber was urgently needed in England for ship building ,  house construction ,  charcoal

For those with a competitive mind ,  all major sports are represented as are several up and coming ones ,  like Bat Polo and Korfball .  Much students '  time is also spent helping others .  Through Community Action , over 1,000 students are involved in areas of work with the local community such as running a <head>shelter</head> for the homeless or teaching an adult to read . Karnival ,  another high profile area of the Students '  Union ,  concentrates its work on fund raising and in the last year raised over 100,000 for various charities .  If ,  as is so often said ,  one of the most important parts of life is getting on with people ,  our years at Nottingham University have certainly prepared us well !

It was just right for his small cine projector ,  and as many as could be packed in ,  watched happy films about Fulham in the springtime or The London Parks or the antics of Mickey Mouse .  But February came with the lowest temperatures for years and March was not much better .  Almost every night there was a raid , Rev Kenneth had to join Father O'Sullivan in the local <head>shelters</head> where morale was very low . I made myself a cape from an old camel hair coat ,  I could not wear that of Queen Alexandra 's  Service .  I was so glad of it as I ran from the admission ward to my office and back .

I begged .  OK ,  was the reply .  They were down the <head>shelter</head> or out of the way , for once . We had one or two casualties to deal with from that raid .  I got a very interesting letter from my fiance .
