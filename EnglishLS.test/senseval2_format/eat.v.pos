In the article on his work which appeared in 1985 Levi is at one point examined with reference to Leviticus .  She takes exception to a story of his about a Jewish Communist ,  an inhabitant of the camps ,  who  fasts there on Yom Kippur .  She observes that the prisoner is following a prohibition laid down in the Old Testament , but that a rabbinical ruling had allowed Jews to <head>eat</head> in the camps on Yom Kippur in order to stay alive . It is not clear why this is a reproach to Levi ,  whose story concerns a man whose piety is idiosyncratic ,  especially severe .  Two years after this ,  in February 1987 ,  she praised a Gulag memoir by Gustav Herling .

These statements are from The Wrench  ,  where Faussone is good at his job and Levi is good at getting this across .  There can be no doubt that he had an ear for what such people have to say for themselves .  Faussone talks about the way we bent our elbows an expression ( for <head>eating</head> or drinking ) which I have heard spoken in English , but which I had never before seen written down in a book . Book - writers ,  Faussone says ,  produce works which may be beautiful and all that ,  but ,  on the other hand ,  even if they were a bit defective ,  excuse the expression ,  nobody would die ,  and the only loser is the customer who bought them .  I have heard that before too ,  but not from any writer .

ACADEMY MENU WAS BLAND AND FAT - LADEN I AM staggered that Frances Bissell should have chosen to praise the Academy of Culinary Arts/Charles Heidsieck awards menu  (  Caterer  Hotelkeeper  ,  2228 August )  .

So many chefs feel their restaurant managers fail to do this adequately .

Many guests visit restaurants with preconceived ideas of what they should <head>eat</head> . Therefore the restaurant manager and other front - of - house staff must use their skill to talk enthusiastically and intelligently about the menu so that customers will appreciate what the chef is producing ,  and dare to be adventurous .

This was a case of Gentlemen versus Players in the golden age when such distinctions still applied and when it was obvious to anyone with an eighth of an intelligence that no paid journeyman could ever begin to compare with the rapier - like amateurs who flitted with effortless superiority ,  solving one crime after another with a brilliant insouciance which was the dismay of the criminal fraternity ,  the envy of the constabulary ,  and a source of immense satisfaction to most of the upper middle class ,  especially those with an aptitude for the Times  crossword .  So when the great lady detective drew a hair from her head and stuck it across the lock on the front door of Sir Vivien 's  motor car ,  Constable Quince said nothing .  And when the great gentleman detective got hold of the village postman and subjected him to an interrogation which ranged from what he had <head>eaten</head> for breakfast to whether or not he possessed a wireless set and if so what he had listened to on the previous morning , Sergeant Bramble maintained a stoic countenance . At luncheon all four of them fetched up in the saloon bar of The Rose and Crown .  A great detective might have considered this an astounding coincidence were it not for the fact that the hostelry was the only place in the whole of King 's  Magnum Parva where a lady or a gentleman might obtain a meal .

The length of time for these processes to occur is very short  ( up to 6 seconds )  .  After this the energy is supplied by the breakdown of muscle glycogen into lactic acid .

It is possible to break down fat to use as energy when you are training ,  but it is essentially glycogen which is the energy source .

This is why reviewing is not properly speaking criticism ,  though it calls for critical qualities ,  and an extended review - article ,  looking at a whole oeuvre ,  may well be .  This is true in all aspects of culture .  If we are discussing a football match or a meal in a restaurant , then at the very least we should all have seen the match or <head>eaten</head> the meal . Furthermore ,  we should have a shared understanding of the rules of discourse about such subjects .  A proper discussion of a football match cannot occur if one of the participants is quite ignorant of the rules of the game ;  and the kind of assessment of a restaurant meal that would involve the possible insertion of the establishment into a good food guide  ( or perhaps its deletion from it )  will not get very far if one of the diners does not care for the meal because his idea of a gastronomic treat is a cheeseburger and french fries  ( though within the order of the burger discriminations are possible )  .

HALF THE pleasure of a southern Chinese meal ought to be the rice ;  its humble utility need not obscure its noble worth .

The banks agree not to sell bonds below the issue price until the arranger of the issue is satisfied that the bulk of the deal has been sold ,  after which ,  members of the group are free to sell at whatever prices they wish .

This they frequently do , <head>eating</head> into , and more often devouring , the commissions they receive from the issuer . At the root of the problems with the old system was cut - throat competition .

One of his students at Simmons was the daughter of Frank Francis ,  Director of the British Museum ,  and this led to close contacts with the printing and publishing world in Britain .  From 1957 Rollo and his wife Alice came to London every year ,  where he was elected an honorary member of the Double Crown Club  ( whom he addressed ,  on WA Dwiggins )  and the Wynkyn de Worde Society .  Friendships made in this country were warmly reciprocated by the Silvers in their beautiful old house in Mt Vernon Street in Boston , where they lived an elegant and simple life : they never owned a car , and never cooked in their kitchen ; all meals except breakfast were <head>eaten</head> in restaurants . Rollo loved being taken to the gilt and plush ambience of Rules in Covent Garden ,  to which his riposte was Lock - Obers in Boston ,  which he protested was not so good .  Rollo Silver was old - fashioned in the best of ways ,  and a warm friend of the book world .

But though the camera may be at gut level ,  a cerebral decision has placed it there ,  and it is characteristic of Greenaway that he should stylise a major element of his film in this way .  For this most unspontaneous of artists ,  it is better to have a bad reason for something  a tenuous or cabbalistic reason  than to depend on chance ,  subjectivity and the moment .  Of course , only a sensibility that is accustomed to seeing food largely in still lifes can be surprised , as Greenaway seems to be , by the revelation that food , whether <head>eaten</head> or not , eventually by digestion or rot comes to look less good . This is a particular case of a general rule about Greenaway 's  films :  that only a person as obsessionally preoccupied with formal patterns as the director  and that is a tall order  can properly share his shock when death turns out not to be deterred by lists and games after all .  More moderate temperaments ,  to whom the patterning seemed a sort of death in the first place ,  are apt to remain stubbornly cheerful .

We are continuing to lobby for full compensation for the commercial value of hens slaughtered and for equivalent testing legislation to be introduced throughout the European Community .

We can <head>eat</head> British produced eggs with confidence . The challenge now for the egg industry is to communicate this message to consumers ;  to look forward to the 1990s with confidence in the knowledge that its product is the best in the world  not to waste time and money on the constant examination of its collective navel and on cries of not fair .  Assuming the Daventry nuns have been subject only to the same controls being applied to all other British egg producers ,  the protest by the United Kingdom Egg Producers '  Association  ( Ukepra )  ,  the only organisation within the UK egg industry not represented among BEIC members ,  is potentially damaging both to egg consumers and to egg producers .

INTERVIEW / Consuming passions :  Alan Howard talks to Sheila Johnston about his role in Greenaway 's  The Cook ,  the Thief ,  his Wife and her Lover By SHEILA JOHNSTON It is not every day that an actor gets <head>eaten</head> in a movie . In Peter Greena way 's  The Cook ,  the Thief ,  his Wife and her Lover ,  Alan Howard ,  as the lover ,  passes through a restaurant ,  a kitchen ,  a cold store and a lorry full of putrifying flesh ;  eventually  ( the cuckolded Thief ,  played by Michael Gambon ,  having visited a terrible revenge )  ,  his naked corpse is served up ,  finely glazed and garnished ,  as an unannounced extra item on the menu .

It has n't been much of a week for my wife either ;  she now sees little prospect of winning back even a beefburger space in the deep freeze .  On the other hand ,  I 've been as happy as a turkey in January ,  and all because of a story I spotted in a medical magazine ,  stating that regular lashings of oily fish cut sharply your chances of having a heart attack .  Tests show that <head>eating</head> lots of fibre or switching to polyunsaturated fats has about as much chance of prolonging your life as wearing a wig , but a kipper two or three times a week will have your life assurance rep collecting the premiums for ever . Now one thing the Elliott household is not short of is oily fish .  Opening the deep freeze is like standing on stage at the Palladium :  there are that many eyes staring out at you .

The heavy mortar in the orchard was sounding its usual musical note as the high explosive left its barrel to fall in the enemy positions a short distance away ,  no doubt causing casualties ,  just as their mortars did when the high explosive landed in the Commando positions .

As Taff and I crouched in our trenches <head>eating</head> our afternoon meal and trying very hard to ignore the clouds of mosquitoes that were buzzing all around us , I looked at Taff .

The peasant revolt that broke out in February 1921 in the Tambov guberniia threatened to cut off rail connections between Moscow and the Volga region ,  since hungry peasants held up wheat trains and ransacked them .  Bolshevik sources reveal that about half the population of the guberniia did not have enough to eat by then ,  and the position was no better by spring  of 1922 .  The revolt was squashed , but Tambov peasants in 1922 were still compelled to pay a levy on the acorns they picked to <head>eat</head> as a substitute for bread . The economic plight of the Volga peasantry was even more crippling than that of the Tambov or Ukrainian population .  There was no fear of revolt in the countryside on the Volga ,  due to sheer exhaustion .

The fourth characteristic of each of the three countries is that they have had the luck to avoid the worst of the droughts which have badly affected agriculture and hydro - electric power supplies in many African countries in the 1970s and 1980s .  While the north of Cameroun has been badly affected ,  its key productive areas lie in the high rainfall zones of the western highlands ;  in Kenya the old colonial rule - of - thumb that one year in five will be a year of drought has been sustained ,  and lean years have been followed by bumper crops .  In Botswana , the negative effects of low rainfall years are offset by the consequent increased sale of livestock , much of which is exported to high - value EC markets , since Botswana 's urban meat - <head>eating</head> population is small . Do these three relatively successful countries provide any kind of signpost to the rest of Africa ?  The answer can be only a muted yes since the economic foundations of most African countries ,  and the size and distribution of their population is very different to the situation prevailing in the early 1960s .
