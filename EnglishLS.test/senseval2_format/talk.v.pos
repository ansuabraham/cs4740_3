James S. Ackerman ,  the architectural scholar ,  makes use of this phrase in writing about art and communication :  What a work of art communicates can be described only in terms of an interaction between  an object and a subject ;  it communicates nothing at all unless someone is there to look at it .  In other words ,  there are no aesthetic objects ,  only physical objects ,  which ,  when observed ,  are capable of stimulating an aesthetic event .  We can return for a moment to <head>talk</head> to the girl who went to Italy , and was overwhelmed by Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel ceiling . Her idea of the value of art criticism was a simple one .  In her mind there was a set of events which includes reading about a work of art and looking at it .

A World Apart  is ,  despite its author 's  socialism ,  a deeply religious book ,  in which she has at times the sense of a man talking to God .  She displays more sympathy for this anti - Semitic Moses ,  for this religious man who is against Jews and against the Soviet system ,  than she does for Jews who are not religious .  Whether or not she has <head>talked</head> to God , she has certainly been reviewing for him. Levi ,  the expert on metals ,  would have had no difficulty in telling the difference between gold and tin .

Any time that a wing begins to drop at a stall it is the beginning of a possible spin ,  but the spin can only develop if the wing is kept stalled and the glider is allowed to continue to yaw .  In the UK there has been much discussion about teaching stall recoveries with a view to making it all easier for the beginner to understand and  remember .  It has been suggested that incipient is an unfamiliar word , that associating the stall with a spin might get the student worried , and that to simplify things we should only <head>talk</head> about stalls and spins . Although it is obviously accurate to call an incipient spin a stall with a wing - drop ,  I think that this is trying to avoid the issue ,  which is that it is really the beginning of a spin and at least a potential spin .

Thus our contacts with firemen ,  St John Ambulance men ,  special constables ,  and the like were all used to define them as being somewhat unreal and therefore slightly less than human .  Such groups were said to be like the foreigners in the adjacent forces ,  for it was constantly repeated that many wanted to join us but failed because of some inadequacy .  This was especially true of the Fire Service , our immediate neighbours , and it applied equally to those in the adjacent Gateshead Borough Police and Northumberland Constabulary , who were always <head>talked</head> of as being a lesser breed of mortals . This characteristic supports Peter Evans  ( 1977 )  ,  then The Times 's   Home Affairs correspondent ,  who described the police as being peculiarly tribal by nature .  In the small forces of the late 1950s these separations were made much of ,  with those in the adjacent forces essentially seen as belonging to another tribe .

Of his attempts to realize this experience over again in his post - Siberian fiction ,  the bald Epilogue to Crime and Punishment  is an early and unpromising instance .

As I suggested apropos the Petrashevsky Circle , one feels an urge to smoke Dostoevsky out with the question , who 's <head>talking</head> ? The epileptic makes a neat reply ,  again touching life and art simultaneously :  the author and hero of The Idiot  .  I have in mind the experience of being suddenly thrust outside time ,  which constitutes in The Idiot  and elsewhere the epileptic aura .

When this and the regeneration/resurrection theme are brought to bear upon the remark about Bazarov and the 1840s ,  what seemed a difference of degree turns out to be one of a kind .  The criticism of Turgenev is only incidentally that he is stuck in the 1840s and not far - sighted enough .  New - sightedness , the timeless standpoint , hitherto unknown reality these have an air of mystical hubris when dragged into the open , but they are what Dostoevsky is really <head>talking</head> about . And so while he sat in a German public library and the story of the murder in the park unfolded before him in the newspapers ,  a novel began to stir .  Or ,  in mystic vein ,  an order of being was glimpsed in which the 1840s ,  the 1860s ,  nihilism ,  Bazarov ,  found themselves apocalyptically and teleologically disposed  those two polysyllabic adverbs embracing and transcended all nature ,  including futurity .

As it is ,  he slyly suggests that minor artists may look down their noses at major ones and that important work may be left to persons of an inferior kennel ,  like the Russians ,  the Germans ,  the Americans ,  who ,  poor dears ,  know no better .  The great cultural danger for the English is ,  to my mind ,  their tendency to judge the arts by the values appropriate to the conduct of family life .  Among brothers and sisters it is becoming to entertain each other with witty remarks , hoaxes , family games and jokes , unbecoming to be solemn , to monopolize the conversation , to <head>talk</head> shop , to create emotional scenes . But no art ,  major or minor ,  can be governed by the rules of social amenity .  The English have a greater talent than any other people for creating an agreeable family life ;  that is why it is such a threat to their artistic and intellectual life .

And once again it was this unrelenting professionalism in Pound that set ,  and continues to set ,  Englishmen 's  teeth on edge .  For in our national tradition ,  in the arts as until recently in sports ,  it is the amateur who is most admired ;  and Auden 's  charming joker by the Christmas hearth is only a particular version of the amateur .  He observes the prohibition against talking shop , whereas Pound through his London years seems never to have <head>talked</head> anything else . ( Once again Eliot knew ,  or soon learned ,  better .  )  And the most Anglophobe of Pound 's  books is ,  appropriately ,  the one that is most full of shoptalk  though of shoptalk of a special kind ,  the talk of the master to his apprentices in the shop that is a workshop ,  the atelier  where the talk that goes on is the vehicle by which an artistic tradition is transmitted ,  not in conceptualizing ,  and tendentious readings of history ,  but where it is concrete  ,  in tricks of the trade and rules of thumb and words to the wise .

No ,  Professor X ,  Pound does not  say that Landor ,  or Landor at his best ,  is better than Keats ;  and no ,  sir ,  he does not  say that Chaucer is better than Milton .  He is concerned with the Miltonic ,  with Miltonism ,  not with Keats but with  bad  Keats ,  not with Browning but with Browningese .  He is not <head>talking</head> about any one of these great writers ( his devotion to Browning was well advertised ) but about , in Eliot 's words , the pernicious or merely deadening influence that a great writer can have , at a particular time . A great writer 's  idiom is ,  by himself when he nods and more certainly by his epigones who emulate and copy him ,  rigidified and adulterated .  And the more idiosyncratic his genius  ( this is the case of Milton ,  surely )  ,  the more likely it is that what will be copied is his mannerisms .

Through the development of community services and a decentralised ,  non - bureaucratic welfare state ,  we can lift people out of poverty and deprivation .

From ROBERT FISK in Taif ,  Saudi Arabia A CONVOY of black limousines conveyed the 31 Lebanese Muslim MPs in Saudi Arabia on an extra - parliamentary pilgrimage to Mecca yesterday afternoon ,  leaving their 31 Christian colleagues behind in Taif to ruminate on how best they might protect Christian political power in a new Lebanon .  No - one is yet <head>talking</head> about a new Lebanon but there is now widespread acceptance among both Muslims and Christians in the Lebanese parliament that the country 's unwritten national covenant is now obsolete . It is this covenant which ordains that the Christian Maronites hold the presidency ,  the leadership of the army and the head of the judiciary while Sunni Muslims provide the prime minister and Shia Muslims the speaker of the Lebanese parliament .  Already ,  however ,  a committee of assembly members  -  among them only one Maronite  has been instructed to draw up a report ,  once the debates are over ,  on the changes in the covenant which a majority of parliamentarians will accept .

And I never went to see Arafat since 1982 because we had not heard of any mood or climate of change in the attitude of the PLO .

Schooling was to train you for some largely predetermined end ,  whether it was a middle or a working - class one ,  not to equip you with the flexible ,  self - determining wherewithal for an open - ended future .  Hence ,  the traditional indifference  ( now obscured by educational theorists '  cant )  to the need to give children the uniquely essential means for social liberation :  an ability to speak and write their own language correctly .  I am not <head>talking</head> here about accents . There is no need to enforce a certain form of pronunciation on the varying regions of Britain  ( although the dropped h is a borderline case  it is probably sufficiently stigmatising to require correction )  .  It is systematically ungrammatical colloquial speech which embeds people in their feudal ancestry .

So ,  what of Branagh 's  purpose ,  if the realism of the film is beside the point ?  Clearly ,  he has some sort of affinity with the part of King Henry ,  but it does n't seem an actorly affinity .  Branagh , too , <head>talks</head> like a winner , and Henry V offers him better than any other play in the repertoire what might be called a yuppie dynamic , a mythology of success and self - definition rather than of struggle . This is not to deny that Branagh is at his best as a performer in Henry 's  most anguished outpouring ,  his prayer to the god of battles before Agincourt ;  here Branagh the actor is least hampered by Branagh the self - publicist .  But it is fair to say that the real chemistry is not between actor and part ,  but between the idea of the star as entrepreneur and the idea of the king as a self - made man.

PEKING  Having dumped two heirs apparent in under three years ,  Deng Xiaoping yesterday moved to buttress the shaky position of yet another set of hand - picked successors by announcing that they ,  not he ,  were now running China .  Speaking to Yasser Arafat ,  the Palestine Liberation Organisation leader ,  who is visiting China ,  Mr Deng announced that the Prime Minister ,  Li Peng ,  and the head of the Communist Party ,  Jiang Zemin ,  were now in charge writes Andrew Higgins .  If there is anything you want to <head>talk</head> about , just talk to them , Mr Deng , China 's paramount leader , told his guest . His remarks follow a media campaign to build up the prestige of Mr Jiang ,  who was party boss in Shanghai before moving to Peking to replace his disgraced predecessor ,  Zhao Ziyang .  Mr Deng has repeatedly promised to retire in recent years ,  but yesterday was the first time he had reissued the pledge since the Tiananmen Square massacre and a shake - up of the party leadership .
