It is in the last hundred years or so that theories have been advanced to justify critical or art historical practice ,  the creation of such theories being made more urgent in the last fifty years by a struggle to establish and then uphold the status of art history as an academic discipline .  The study of Oriental art in the West has fared less well .  A firm basis for the study of Oriental art came more slowly , and as we shall see , some of the <head>differences</head> of approach between East and West still require wider recognition . Moreover ,  other cultures ,  such as those of Africa ,  have had to wait until even more recent times for recognition .  It is literature within the last three centuries ,  then ,  that provides the main choices for a reader .

In writing about Delacroix ,  he placed his hero in a pantheon of artists who were acknowledged masters of great decorative painting :  Which is the greatest of these great men who differ so much from one another ?

A Japanese example is the surimono  ,  a friendly greeting for the New Year through a drawing and a message which complement each other. Here a measure of interpretation is integral to the work itself .  The long - standing popularity of Japanese woodcut prints in the West has somewhat disguised <head>differences</head> in approach . The undeniable and striking formal qualities of composition in works by such masters as Hokusai and Hiroshige have had demonstrable effects on late - nineteenth - and twentieth - century European art .  Nevertheless ,  such prints are not  justly reduced even in description to mere compositional terms .

A universal fellowship obtains .  The definition of personality which is harboured in such procedures has moved and influenced several generations of writers .  The art that comes of them is one in which imagination takes power , the power to distort and exaggerate , in which <head>difference</head> of person is suspended , in which the experience of time is as it is in dreams . The story that is told is a story which never ends  and which risks losing shape and momentum  because it is a story told of himself by a living author ,  an author who has yet to end ,  whose isolate 's  imaginative fury lives on to tell another tale ,  some more of his own story .  This fury can look like an onanistic or a solipsistic fury .

It was strongly influenced by the development and multiplication of the religious congregational system developed by Ignatius of Loyala ,  founder of the Jesuits and of the famous spiritual exercises or retreat system .  The exercises  were specifically directed to obtaining this effect .  A main real <head>difference</head> in the experience which marked it off from fundamentalist and some pentecostal forms of conversion experience was that the outcome was not the assurance of being saved , but rather a spirituality of trust in Christ based on repentance and the conviction that God forgives repentant sinners . In this respect ,  it paralleled some forms of evangelicalism ,  particularly methodism .  The trust implied fidelity or commitment ,  together with an abandoning of the old ways of sin and indifference for a total dedication to God 's  will in Christ .

In submitting his report ,  Dominian stated :  I have to say that if this room was filled by the Roman Catholic bishops of Ireland and they were pushing me very hard about divorce , I would have to say very clearly that their fear that civil divorce will make marital breakdown worse , or enhance or facilitate it my answer would be : No , it will make very little <head>difference</head> .

This research at home is primarily about the society of the self and the self in that society .  It encompasses an internal exploration of a personal history within a culture and inevitably differs in scale from much of the anthropology at home which has become one of the  genres of the 1980s .  Inevitably it has qualitative <head>differences</head> and is not easily written or smoothly integrated into the isms or historical categories of the discipline . Material obtained in such circumstances inevitably contains the seeds of a special inside knowledge ,  avoiding problems described by Liebow  ( 1967 :  23256 )  ,  who was still separated by cognitive barriers while pursuing research in what was ostensibly his own society ,  and who found an insider 's  language ,  education ,  and social membership all helped to retain boundaries he was unable to penetrate .  The semantic ability of the insider to translate the hidden and the unspoken aspects of the cultural agenda which occur in any society should be especially productive in any analysis of the police ,  where a massive visibility at one level is matched by a secretive ,  hidden side to institutional practice .

I suspect it is no  accident the politics of the times seems to parallel the growing toughness of the police image ,  or that the police have taken on an increasing resemblance to the black - clothed enemies of goodness who sprinkle the popular science fantasy films such as Star Wars ,  Superman  ,  and the like .  In these mass cultural replays of the eternal dichotomy between good and evil ,  the use of highly symbolic black uniforms as an indicator of anonymous evil predominates .  Within the separate police forces , the nuances of uniform <head>difference</head> were always embroidered by real polises to produce symbolic boundaries from which to assess other uniform wearers . Thus our contacts with firemen ,  St John Ambulance men ,  special constables ,  and the like were all used to define them as being somewhat unreal and therefore slightly less than human .  Such groups were said to be like the foreigners in the adjacent forces ,  for it was constantly repeated that many wanted to join us but failed because of some inadequacy .

For analytic purposes ,  these can be cast into a binary model ,  suggesting positive and negative polarities of :   Such spatial and temporal fixations are also deliberately elaborated in other institutions of control ,  such as the armed forces .

The police also use concepts of a disciplined body in their dealings to effect the capture of the local villains  ( or prigs )  .  In any public confrontation a quick assessment and early resolution is the order of the day ,  for on the streets pragmatism always rules and real polises set out immediately to fix their adversaries by using deeply imbued constructs relating to time and space .

Layton described the four things which stand out in Leonard ,  which give him the confidence to work as he does ,  and promote his work :  The strong tradition of learning ;  the business entrepreneurship of his family ;  the broad philanthropy/charity which hall - marked it ;  and ,  lastly ,  the self - awareness that comes from being a Cohen  not understood as class - distinction ,  but from the high symbolism of the priest and his role .

But we should also note  ( as the critics largely did not )  the positive values he inculcates in such reflections ,  with which he concludes his piece :  Must we find all work prosaic ?  It is typical of him to assert ,  as Judaism does roundly ,  that all work is honourable ;  and deny that the reliance on special work and destiny  ( God 's  work )  elevates a man per se  .  Not so ! asserts our poet there is no <head>difference</head> between the sacred and the secular , prayer or work ( which have the same root in Hebrew ) ; oneness will out ! If Let Us Compare Mytholoqies  marks the awakening of his poetic consciousness when the city of Montreal  ( and all that was in it ,  not excluding its female charms )  began to jump at me ,  The Spice - Box Of Earth  marks the heightening of his Jewish consciousness which he  encountered in young adulthood ,  as a free agent abroad in the world ,  having to establish his own identity at a time when his own Tradition ,  and his position in it ,  began likewise to jump at him. Noteworthy is a second dedication in this regard ,  of a single poem to Marc Chagall  ( also a Russian Jew of hasidic extraction )  whose rich symbolism entranced Leonard .

Ondaatje perceived this and described the book as being far nastier and more frightening than Flowers For Hitler  ;  but the choice of words is unjust :  there is nothing nasty or frightening about honest observation .  Such value - judgments surely arise out of the critics '  disappointment at finding negative aspects in an otherwise positive projection ,  an all -   to   - human aspiration for avoiding reality which Leonard refuses to do ,  to his great cost .  Manzano has drawn attention to a real <head>difference</head> when he says ( of both these first books ) , In general Cohen is lyrical in his writings when he refers to himself , and anarchistic when he confronts the outside world , a comment which becomes more fully justified as time goes by , though Leonard 's anarchism remained personal and mainly verbal . He is wont to talk of the new vision that Lorca 's  poetry gave to him ;  here is my landscape ,  he exclaimed repeatedly .  But that other landscape ,  quieter perhaps ,  but like an underground stream ,  unconscious and very persistent ,  never failed to obtrude itself on him :  It is strange that even now prayer is my natural language ,  he said ,  in Lines From My Grandfather 's  Journal  ( The Spice - Box Of Earth ,  p10 )  which powerfully reflect his own self - questionings ;  the tyranny was asserting itself .

On the other hand ,  materialists seem to be prevented by their materialism from allowing that there is any relevant fact that BS does not know .  The way that most materialists try to reconcile their flight from behaviourism with their materialist world picture is to say that when V sees something ,  and BS observes V 's  brain ,  BS knows everything about V 's  mental states that V himself knows ,  but that he knows about it in a different way  .  It is this <head>difference</head> of way which constitutes the difference of feel in their experience . This reply sounds very plausible ,  until one reflects on it ;  and then a serious difficulty emerges .

It is impossible to deny that V has a different mode of access to the external world from BS ,  for V can see and BS cannot .  But the question is how this constitutes a subjective <head>difference</head> .

In brief ,  topic neutrality was invoked to explain why ,  within the materialist scheme ,  consciousness of our mental states is not sufficient for knowledge of them as  brain states :  what it cannot do is explain why knowledge of brain states is not sufficient for knowledge of their nature as conscious states .  A rather similar ,  and equally mistaken ,  line of thought which might appeal is as follows .  It might be thought that the subject 's apprehension of his own brain is more immediate and more holistic than any external knowledge , however complete , and that this explains the experiential <head>difference</head> between the two kinds of knowledge . The scientist has essentially separate pieces of information ,  whereas the subject has a sort of Gestalt  .

How is a cognisant episode such as this going to be analysed away into the language of activity ?  Well clearly it is not  going to yield to any such analysis ,  and to believe that it will is to deny the reality of subjective life and to side with the behaviourists .  What I can say , however , is that the constructivist position allows a distinctive analysis of the mental when we speak of a mental representation of a green patch : it helps us to understand the <head>difference</head> between mental representations and the non - mental variety ( a photograph for example ) . At the time of looking up we ascribe an experience of greenness to ourselves ;  we consider the experience as something being undergone by us before any decision is taken about its veridicality .  Such an ascription is a cognisant act involving ,  at the very least ,  a conception of a one 's  self ,  a conception of experience ,  and a conception of veridicality .

Of course ,  nobody as yet knows how intentionality  the property that mental phenomena have of being about  something other than themselves  or consciousness emerge from the operations of the brain .  From the perspective of functionalism  ( and from the perspective of other materialist theories also )  ,  however ,  this is a question for science rather than an imponderable problem of metaphysics .  Searle ( 1984 , pp. 1821 ) strongly supports the view that intentionality and consciousness are emergent properties , but there is at least one important <head>difference</head> between Searle 's account of emergent properties and the one I am advocating here . I have no quarrel with Searle 's  claim that mental phenomena are caused by processes going on in the brain .  When he states subsequently that mental phenomena just are features of the brain ,  thus tying mental phenomena very rigidly to the brain itself ,  then I dissent .

What a <head>difference</head> ! January saw the inauguration of the Bournemouth - Weymouth electrification and three months later 16.4million was promised to convert the Portsmouth - Southampton route .  Enter the Class 91 ,  the new breed of East Coast main - line electric locomotive .

His choreography is firmly based on the authentic folk and flamenco dances he studied in Spain .  His work must ,  therefore ,  be considered as one of the very few character/national ballets of its time ,  like the Russian ballets of Fokine .  Elsewhere reference has been made to the <head>difference</head> between Spanish style and flamenco style ( see page 59 ) which belongs to the Spanish gipsies from whom has also developed what is known as gipsy character dance . There is however a third style of Spanish dance known as Spanish Court dance .  This developed after the French Revolution of 1789 when many french dancing masters fled to Spain to become dancing masters to the aristocratic families .

The carefree quality disappears when she shyly tries to tell the Tutor how fond she has become of him ,  and when she discovers Natalia and the Tutor in each other 's  arms ,  she loses all inhibitions to denounce them .  Her shy confession of love is in deep contrast to that of Natalia ,  who cannot wait to show that her emotions are fully aroused when left alone with the same man. It is in these brief intimate scenes that Ashton exploits the <head>difference</head> between youth fulling in love and experience demanding it , because Natalia is used to getting her own way . It may be asked :  How does the Tutor react to these situations ?  Ashton 's  choreography follows the style used by the Moscow Arts Theatre production of the play  he is danced in the ballet in the same way as he is acted in Russia .

MacMillan 's  Bratfisch tries to keep his employer amused and thus to postpone the inevitable tragedy .  He only reveals his true feelings when he throws his flower into Mary Vetsera 's  grave just before the curtain falls .  His dance throughout has its base in the classical vocabulary but MacMillan has coloured it by gestures from cabaret and vaudeville dance traditions , which serve to reveal not only class <head>differences</head> in behaviour but also genuine feelings . This is why Bratfisch is so important .  Without him there is no other character with whom the audience can feel sympathy .

TILING WALLS The best way to practise your tiling skills if you 've never done any before if by covering just a small area such as a washbasin splashback ,  where setting out the tiles so they are centred on the area concerned is a simple job ,  and you have the minimum of tile cutting to do .  When you are tackling a larger area a whole wall , or perhaps even a complete room you use exactly the same techniques ; the big <head>difference</head> is the sheer scale of the job , which makes the preliminary setting - out by far the most important part . The problem is that unless you have absolutely plain walls ,  there will be a number of obstacles to tile round ,  and you have to decide how to get the best fit round them with your inflexible tile squares ,  without ending up cutting impossibly thin slivers to fill in all the gaps .  You may also want to tile awkward shapes such as the window recesses ,  or things like bath surrounds .

In his exchange with Nastasya he reveals himself an underground man who has wandered into a nineteenth - century naturalistic novel ,  a bohemian Hamlet .  The point of contact with the fable of disembodied consciousness  is that thinking has become Raskolnikov 's  work ,  it has almost become Raskolnikov ,  and if he did and were nothing but this work we would have the first part of Notes from Underground  repeated .  And of course committing the murder is an act of perverse self - assertion , like the underground man 's notional sticking his tongue out with the <head>difference</head> that the anti - hero 's mind movement breaks no bones , and hurts no feelings except his own .

Light hearted With regard to the debate about c  and Doppler shifts in the letters pages ,  light  ( velocity c  )  reflected or emitted from a surface moving with velocity v  towards an observer appears to be blue shifted ,  or red shifted in the case of a receding surface .  As a non - physicist I have often wondered if the <head>difference</head> in photon energy ( E ' E = hf ' hf ) of the shifted and unshifted light could be wholly accounted for by the effect of the surface velocity ( v ) acting together with the particle equivalent mass of the photon . The extra energy not being allowed to be expressed as an increase in c appears as a commensurate increase in f ,  that is :   ( formula included )  where m is the photon equivalent mass  ( yes I know it is related to E  but I am trying not to confuse myself )  ,  E  is the energy ,  and h  is Mr Plank 's  claim to fame .  I write this letter in the hope that someone will explain the errors of my ways ,  forgive me for mixing relativistic and Newtonian physics ,  and enlighten me .

But it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rules to prevent the absurd see - sawing of industrial relations legislation we have seen since 1969 .

The case for electoral reform is best discussed in terms of the question :  what kind of political system do we want ?

The <head>difference</head> goes far deeper than the political complexion of the government . The strong tendency of pluralistic systems of Europe is consensual and ,  in some cases ,  quasi - corporatist ;  on the other side of the coin ,  they enable extremist minorities to thrive .

The dock strike failed because the transport workers did not have the strength to defend the labour monopoly enjoyed by registered dockers in a number of ports once the Government removed its statutory underpinning .  At much the same time ,  however ,  workers on British Rail successfully defended their procedures in the courts and subsequently went on to conduct a very effective strike from which they emerged victorious .  Unions are demonstrating a growing sophistication and success in their use of the law , while the courts are increasingly aware of the <head>difference</head> between an employer who is frivolously testing his rights to its limits and an enterprise with genuine reason for seeking an interim injunction .

That ,  in a later work of extensive and original research into little - known source material ,  carried out in partnership with his wife Marian ,  Keeton should have something to say in favour of Lord Chancellor Jeffreys ,  brought him little joy from quarters whose traditional schoolboy images he chose to query .  So it would be possible to go on :  anybody who wishes to do so will find plenty of relevant material in the conscientious bibliography by Sultana Saeed in Law Justice and Equity :  essays in tribute to GW Keeton  ( 1967 )  .  The closest comparison with another polymath in our time that , in spite of personal and other <head>differences</head> , comes to mind is with Arnold Toynbee . The common denominator is less the substratum of overlapping spheres of knowledge than intuitive awareness and ,  even more so ,  shared condemnation from disdainful detractors .

David Evans ,  the stand - off who plays centre for Wales ,  and Andrew Booth ,  his scrum - half partner ,  virtually sealed the result in the second half simply by appreciating what the Newport pair ,  David Phillips and Nigel Callard ,  had failed to grasp in the first  that kicking downwind is as good a way as any of gaining huge chunks of ground to keep the pressure on .  The simple <head>difference</head> in rugby intellect plus a glaring weakness in Newport 's defensive cover allowed Cardiff to improve a 12 - 9 interval deficit with four second - half tries . The best Newport had to offer was a solid front row ,  the line - out jumping of their veteran lock ,  David Waters ,  and a passion which ,  in the case of 19 - year - old No. 8 Ian McKim ,  needs restraining .  McKim ,  a Wales youth player last season and new to some of the more unwelcome machinations of senior rugby ,  lost his temper so totally after a brush with the Cardiff prop Jeff Whitefoot that he even lashed out at Newport 's  skipper ,  Glen George ,  who was trying to cool him down.

Although the Army and MI5 still retain some independent intelligence gathering capabilities in the province ,  the system is now largely centralised and works well  the IRA itself has admitted that one of the reasons it has exported a growing proportion of its violence to the continent and mainland Britain is because it has become increasingly risky for them to operate on home territory .  But in the mid - 1970s there was an acrimonious conflict between the different intelligence gathering agencies in the province .  Matters became so serious that in August 1979 Sir Maurice Oldfield , the former Chief of MI6 and model for John Le Carre 's fictional spy master George Smiley was sent to Northern Ireland to cover the <head>differences</head> between MI6 , MI5 , Army intelligence and the RUC .

Lower trade barriers permitted their development ,  and Japanese government restrictions on overseas investment encouraged companies that treated markets on a global basis and benefitted from economies of scale .

To some extent the <head>difference</head> between this view and the developmental approach is one of semantics : the term global company does not mean the same to each . Yet there is greater emphasis in the transnational company model on the complete integration and interdependence of operating structures .  This may occur in Keegan 's  global company but there the emphasis lies more in the company 's  approach to products and markets ,  without the same global integration of flows of resources ,  ideas and people .

Such comparisons are often difficult due to lack of available data ,  and comparisons are often made by measuring GNP per capita in local currency and using the exchange rate of the currency against an international standard  ( typically US  )  .  However ,  whilst this method of comparison relies on easily available information ,  it is not exact ;  exchange rates relate to goods which are traded internationally ,  whilst the the majority of the national product of most countries is comprised of goods which never enter the international marketplace .  The <head>differences</head> in real income can thus be distorted . As just one example ,  agricultural goods are generally priced lower in relation to industrial products in developing countries than in industrial countries ,  and this may lead to an exaggeration of the apparent differences in per capita income .  Another potentially distorting factor is that whilst average incomes can be compared between one country and another ,  they do not of themselves reveal the true comparable standard of living ,  nor the comparable potential markets for all products .

When it came to deciding how to Vote however ,  the most frequent response was that television and the press were equally useful .  people who were not regular paper readers relied more on television ,  while Guardian  readers relied more on the press ;  but a plurality of every other paper 's  readers said they found press and television equally useful .  So amongst tabloid readers generally , but especially amongst Sun/Star readers , there was a dramatic <head>difference</head> between their overwhelming preference for television as a source of information and their reliance upon both press and television for helping them decide how to vote . We might have expected that people would give particularly low ratings to sources they described as biased but there was little evidence of any such reaction .

These findings broadly echo those of Gunter ,  Svennevig ,  and Wober  ( 1986 ,  pp.989 )  ,  whose study of the 1983 election campaign showed that objectively measured knowledge was significantly correlated with interest  in political discussion programmes both on radio and television ,  but with only one news - consumption  variable  claimed viewing of television news  ( italics added )  .  In our analysis of the 1987 campaign we have distinguished more  clearly between personal factors such as political interest and mobilizing factors such as television viewing ;  and we have detected a strong trend in the balance of influence between these two influences .  In the Pre - Campaign Wave there was a 41 per cent <head>difference</head> in awareness of polls between those with a high and low interest in politics . Following J. S. Coleman 's  terminology we can say that the effect of political interest on awareness of opinion polls was 41 per cent in the pre - Campaign Wave .

With secondrank politicians ,  interest in politics continued to be a strong   predictor of their visibility ,  although the impact of television viewing also increased  ( Table 7.9 )  .  Indeed ,  instead of declining ,  the effect of political interest on awareness of other Conservative politicians actually rose from 32 per cent to 37 per cent between the Pre - Campaign Wave and the end of the campaign ,  and its effect on awareness of other Labour politicians declined only from 38 per cent to 34 per cent .  Overall , there remained a roughly constant <head>difference</head> between the interested and the uninterested . At the same time the effect of television viewing on public awareness of other Conservatives rose from 11 per cent to 25 per cent while its effect on public awareness of other Labour politicians rose from 6 per cent to 18 per cent  ( Table 7.10 )  .

So ,  apart from age making people personally pessimistic about their own circumstances ,  economic perceptions were primarily influenced by a combination of personal political prejudice  ( partisanship )  and biased information sources  ( right - wing or left - wing papers )   ( Table 7.14 )  .  A trend analysis confirms these regression findings .  There was always an enormous <head>difference</head> between the economic perceptions of those who initially had Conservative and Labour preferences , especially those who described themselves as party supporters .

It is difficult to see that as anything other than an attempt to intimidate the BBC .  Our content analysis of national television news in Chapter 4 suggests that television news was biased both towards the government of the day  ( through extra coverage of the government )  and towards right - wing political viewpoints  ( through its emphasis on crime ,  defence ,  and security )  .  Our comparison of BBC - TV with ITV in Chapter 5 showed that there was little <head>difference</head> between them . Our opinion survey in Chapter 6 showed that most voters felt television news on both networks was unbiased ;  but amongst the minority who felt it  was biased a majority thought it was biased towards the Conservatives and against both Labour and the Alliance .  At the same time a large majority of voters thought that the press was biased ,  and that it was biased towards the Conservatives ,  against Labour ,  and against the Alliance .

At the outset it may prove useful , if only to discover <head>differences</head> rather than similarities , to contrast Great - Russian nationalism with French . Both nations were highly centralized ,  and both underwent fundamental revolutions ,  but their geographical scale and relationship to national minorities were  very different .  After 1789 politicians were the main architects of French nationalism ,  but in Russia at the start of NEP Marxist internationalism and Trotsky 's  theory of permanent revolution still imbued most leading Bolsheviks ,  with the significant exception of Stalin ,  whose treatment of Georgia in 1922 was to shock Lenin .
