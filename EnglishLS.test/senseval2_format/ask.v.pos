The success of the initial pilot programme has been recognised by the Ministry of Health and the Institute of Health Education and led to Maurice ,  Kate and Ana meeting with Government officials and representatives from UNICEF to establish a long - term training programme in five Romanian regions ,  starting in November of this year .  The attitude of many Romanian health professionals was summed up recently in the words of one doctor in Constanta who said Health Education is the only vaccine we have to fight against HIV .  Kate Bristow commented , It is a real privilege for ACET to be <head>asked</head> to work with such people as they look for ways to develop an effective strategy . International Adviser Professor Jonathan Mann ,  former director of the WHO Global AIDS Programme ,  has given his backing to ACET by joining Dr Everett Koop the former US Surgeon General ,  as an International Adviser .

Discretionary grants for further education have suffered in the climate of recent economic cuts and local government spending allowances can affect the number and level of grants awarded .  Generally ,  a local authority will aim to cover the full cost of fees and a living allowance although this can be subject to your personal circumstances and will vary depending on whether you will live with your parents during term time ,  or in rented accommodation .  It is possible that your local authority may <head>ask</head> you to audition for them after you have been offered a place . This seems an odd  way of going about things ,  but the advising panels do carry a professional adviser so that talent is not merely being judged by local civil servants .  The object of this rather clumsy piece of administration is to place some check on the expenditure of local money on the arts  and also to provide a further checkpoint on students who have already received educational grants for other careers .

By now you will have made a definite decision to become an actor  no matter what the problems or obstacles .  The next step is to prepare for the audition at a drama school and find the right kind of textual material which will allow you to show the best of yourself .  On obtaining a prospectus and <head>asking</head> for an application form , you will find that every drama school will require an audition fee , and this can vary between 15 and 25 . If you can afford to ,  it 's  generally best to spread your auditions around the drama schools so that you are seen more than once .  When auditioning for most schools you will be asked to present at least two contrasting speeches and possibly give some idea of your attitude to improvisation and ,  perhaps ,  to singing .

Not all auditions have just two speeches ,  classical and modern .  You may well be asked to sing something unaccompanied ,  or do a short improvisation and you may well be asked to perform one of the speeches in a different way .  In some schools you will be <head>asked</head> to participate with other students in basic class work over a weekend ( as happens at the Bristol Old Vic drama school ) and in some you may find yourself being judged partly by senior students of the school who will be sitting with the faculty panel ( which is something that happens at Drama Centre ) . The point of preparation is to be well tuned and at the same time flexible to new interpretations and ideas .  Rigidity of approach is something to be avoided at all costs  there is no point in being able to do a party piece one way and be unable to take in new direction on the same material .

Auditions are  nerve - wracking for everyone who does them  ( and for that matter ,  for everyone who watches them )  but  being sure of your text is the least you can do .  Should that unthinkable thing happen ,  and you forget your lines ,  do n't despair .  A sympathetic panel may well <head>ask</head> you to start again . But there is no trick to the business of learning lines ,  as you will find out as you go on  although learning lines for an audition is different from memorising a part in a play for production ,  because then you will be operating with other actors around you .  On the whole ,  acting in isolation is a peculiar feature of the audition system ,  which is why the pieces you choose in either the classic or modern text need to be reasonably well contained and lend themselves to being performed as a one man show .

And how much of this er horticultural poison does it take to kill a human being ? <head>asked</head> Henry , ignoring this last . Not a lot ,  said the inspector quietly .  Something under a fifth of a teaspoonful  say four or five drops  added to which it is highly soluble .

You will understand when you see its handsome dark green leathery leaves and startling gold - eyed daisies ,  their cerise - magenta ray florets in branched heads 11/2ft above the ground .

For example ,  checking the items in the wrong order is totally unacceptable because it can so easily lead to missing something out altogether .  A re - check should never be necessary ,  since this only implies the acceptance of a half - hearted check in the first place .  The idea of having the person attaching the cable <head>ask</head> if the airbrakes are closed and locked has been introduced in some clubs to try and prevent incidents where pilots take off with their airbrakes unlocked . However ,  if you are going to re - check the airbrakes ,  it would seem logical to check all the items in the check - list as well .  Many instructors are not careful ,  or thoughtful enough about either their initial teaching or their subsequent monitoring of their students as they do their own cockpit checks .

Its early implementation met with a degree of resistance ,  for the new system fundamentally dislocates the well established and cultural preferences of the service .  Inspectors can no longer hide behind a paper managing a desk  ( quote from a Chief Superintendent )  .  Then again for reasons of established cultural preference we had to go back to the Audit Commission and <head>ask</head> them to translate 6.358 million into real men , for we had difficulty in trying to sell such an alien concept to the police mind . In effect their fiscal mandate meant their version of reality failed to synchronize with the police world view .

I then found my application for financial assistance for part - time study had been rejected because anthropology is not on the approved list of subjects  ( in the Circular )   ( Memo from HQ 1977 )  .  Eventually I was able to convince my senior officers that anthropology was  one of the social sciences ,  perhaps only because I somewhat sardonically returned a memo which asked why ,  if anthropology is not approved ,  have I just been allowed to read the subject on a Bramshill Scholarship ,  on full pay and allowances ?  Just over a year later , at a Career Appraisal Interview with the chief constable , I was <head>asked</head> : tell me , how did you find the law course at the polytechnic ?

Since this condemnation of research opportunity ,  few studies have penetrated deeply beneath the sensitive skin of police culture ,  and even though Chatterton in his notes to my thesis argued there has been a considerable amount of participant police research ,  I would question whether many of these inquiries achieved the finer grain and detail ' of the insider 's  account ,  for they can never really know or tell if they have been excluded from the inner workings of police practice or prevented from gaining access to the hidden realities contained inside the heads of the constables .  Because of the litism which such an organization of control wields ,  it is not surprising there is difficulty in incorporating the outside researcher ,  or in accepting his critical findings .  And certainly that other main arm of executive control the army seems little better at this than the police , for the number of participant accounts of their deep structures remains negligible , supporting McCabe 's ( 1980 ) contention that we should be <head>asking</head> of all of these costly institutions , who is to be controlled by whom and for what reasons ? Meanwhile ,  as Reiner  ( 1985 )  suggests ,  the politicization of the police has proceeded at a pace ,  and can be illustrated by their growing willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy .  This trend is further displayed in their growing tendency to agree to be used as a pseudo - military arm of government in its socio - economic and industrial/political disputes with whole sections of society .

the implication of attempting to establish a central research information centre to give advice to chief officers about research findings ,  or collect ,  collate and distribute research of interest to the police service ,  and maintain an up - to - date index of research would be very considerable .  There are no plans to establish such a centre .  No one seems to have <head>asked</head> whether the Staff College could have taken on this job , but then again such anti - intellectualism is apparent even in the Bramshill Scholars ' Association .

The emphasis of this directed  ( or controlled ?  )  research ,  it was announced ,  is to be on pragmatic ,  problem - solving enquiries  ( i.e. policy - orientated research )  ,  which ,  it was explained ,  would be of cost - effective advantage to the force .  There seems to be little chance of any philosophical ,  unprogrammatic enquiry here which might be critical of the system ;  and no espionage from within !  This cost - effective nature of a scholarship was a matter I had been <head>asked</head> to justify when I first asked my new assistant chief constable about the potential of postgraduate research as an observing participator . I had mentioned the unquantifiable public relationships which could be generated during a secondment and argued for the intangible value of the many hundreds of contacts I had made which could not easily be costed in purely fiscal terms .

And surely ,  it can be argued ,  the understanding of what is to be ordered and who is to be disciplined has long been defined and subject to the practical mastery of the controllers .  In consequence ,  even when the insider retires and ostensibly leaves the family ,  he will be expected to maintain his silence ,  and although bland hagiographic biography has been acceptable in the past ,  there has been no place for the espionage of critical ethnography .  And even as the unlamented Official Secrets Act of 1911 groaned in its death throes in the late 1980s ( to be replaced by an even more constraining measure ) , officers about to retire in West Mercia were presented with an official force form and <head>asked</head> to sign a Declaration under the Act . This reiterates the whole catch - all section 2 of the Official Secrets Act of 1911 ,  as well as the scale of punishments laid down by the Official Secrets Act of 1920 for those who possess any secret official code word ,  or password ,  or sketch ,  plan ,  model ,  article ,  note ,  document or information which relates to or is used in a prohibited place or anything in such a place ,  or which has been made or obtained in contravention of this Act ,  or which has been entrusted in confidence to him by any person holding office under Her Majesty or which  he has obtained or to which he has had access owing to his position as a person who is or has been employed under a person who holds or has held such an office or contract  and who  ( a )  communicates the code word ,  pass word ,  sketch ,  plan ,  model ,  article ,  note ,  document ,  or information to any person other than a person to whom he is authorised to communicate it ,  or a person to whom it is in the interest of the State his duty to communicate it ,  or  ( aa )  uses the information in his possession for the benefit of any foreign power or in any other manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State ,  or  ( b )  retains the sketch ,  plan ,  model ,  article ,  note ,  or document in his possession or control when he has no right to retain it or when it is contrary to his duty to retain it ,  or fails to comply with all directions issued by lawful authority with regard to the return or disposal thereof ,  or

By reducing the social space between the dichotomies of ordered law enforcers and uncontrolled prigs ,  the detective necessarily returns a degree of humanity to the prig which the uniform collar feeler is always structured to deny .  The lowly polis ,  with little or no power in the system ,  deplores this situation and complains of its escalation ,  while the detectives moan about the incompetence of the uniform wollies who never get close enough to their prisoners to extract their own coughs or admissions and who fail to understand that the system largely depends on the ability of the department to manipulate a statistical norm in detected crimes .  Stead ( 1980 : 305 ) , like Mervyn Jones ( 1980 ) , has also pointed out how police organization attributes low status to beat work , and <head>asks</head> the service to reconsider the value of the patrol officer : I would enter a plea that I have often made that the street officer 's  authority and discretion should be given better recognition .  It has always seemed to me rather sad that almost any move from beat duty is regarded as a promotion .

resulted in the controllers making a puritan attack directed at the drug taking of the  ( underground )  movement ;  and since the drug - scene is complex and confused ,  and we have little time in which to develop a reliable folk - lore about drugs and how to take them  ( as we have long ago done about alcohol )  ,  they have been particularly successful in fostering anxiety among teachers ,  parents and establishment figures .  Our part in this controlling puritan attack consisted of making the occasional arrest ,  while pursuing the unquantifiable social role which filled most of our time .  Furlong is correct , however , in suggesting that anxiety was rife , and because of this and establishment obsessions with a belief in a statistical truth we were constantly being <head>asked</head> to give numerical estimates of how many there were out there who were fixing , using the weed , or dropping acid . During the first three years of full - time drug squad work  ( 19668 )  arrests totalled some sixty - four persons  or less than two per month .  In this same period I saw many hundreds of users who never featured in the arrest tables and took many to hospital .

It can be likened to becoming them or no longer being us ,  for I had further increased my distance from the working lives of the real polises and had moved out of their known world to become an outsider ,  a liminal mover .  At university I chanced to meet a detective sergeant who had been in the Durham drug squad outside the Sociology building in New Elvet ,  Durham city .  He was now in the CID in the city and somewhat tentatively <head>asked</head> what subject I was reading . He seemed relieved when I told him I was reading anthropology and ,  looking somewhat apprehensively over his shoulder at the sociology building ,  he muttered well thank goodness you 're not taking bloody sociology ,  with all those left wing bastards who hate the polis .  An inspector who came to Durham at the same time as myself to read Law and the Sociology of Law ,  found the latter course  required a move to concepts outside normal police experience .

God help us when you do !  But I have clammed up about L. Feel superstitious .  Maybe if I keep mum and keep my fingers crossed what did my father always say when I could n't have something : Them that <head>ask</head> do n't get , them that do n't ask , do n't want . He thought it was funny and who needs  a Mary Poppins LP ,  a Beatles poster ,  a sequinned belt ,  anyway .  Well ,  I did and did n't get and now I have all these things .

A million and one impressive ways with left - overs .

James Menzies and the McLaggans ,  riding on horses ,  led the rest away on the long climb of the hill to Dunskiag ,  a gaunt treeless place where the owner lived without a woman and three great staghounds with long coarse hair slavered to get at them ,  wrenching their chains .  They did not waste time there but headed downhill ,  taking the shepherds '  road that slanted luminous green between clusters of birches ,  their shadows stretching ahead like gawky giants so that the children jigged to make the shadows jump and curved their fingers from their heads to give the giants silhouettes like devils .  The Flemyngs would be away , no doubt , at a banquet in Perth , and they were ; a butler spoke to them from an upper window and <head>asked</head> them would they kindly leave a message so they marked the house with dirt and rotten potatoes while the servants rushed to bar the shutters over the windows . The last of the sunlight was diffusing through the trellis of oaks and evergreens in a yellow sparkle ;  single rays pierced through like stings ;  in the gloaming .  Aberfeldy was a ghost town .

And where was Allan Stewart ? <head>asked</head> Cameron innocently . Ach ,  where was anyone last night ?  James retorted ,  and he went over to unlock his warehouse and take delivery of a cartload of barrels from Dunkeld .

Not declare  pronounce .  The one was as pompous as the other. He would <head>ask</head> young Alex for the ring , and see that it was put well on Mary 's finger , he would wish them to be happy and fruitful and true to one another and that nothing would ever part them . And that was what he said ,  at one o'clock in the afternoon ,  in the smithy yard at Ballinluig .  The house  was much too small ;  people made a deep ring round the couple and Cameron ,  standing on the cobbles among piles of bar and rod iron ,  the children perched on tree - stumps and on the lower branches of the very old yew tree which made a dark thicket with its multiple trunks .

Who is the owner ? he started to <head>ask</head> . A surge in the crowd behind him jolted him forwards and he saved himself ,  and the woman ,  by setting his feet wide and holding onto her shoulders .

He was being cheated .  It was all too premature .  He had things to <head>ask</head> , things to learn of his father , things to tell him. In a moment of youthful inspiration ,  the day after the funeral ,  he took one of his father 's  bow ties ,  one reserved for special occasions ,  and opened up its seams ,  into which he infiltrated a message  his first poetic utterance ,  as he told his Spanish biographer ,  Alberto Manzano  long since forgotten  ( or too painful to remember ?  )  .  He buried it in the back garden ,  near the fence ,  overlooking the park that  overlooks the city of which his father was so proud .

It was situated in an old house ,  a three - storey building which the students and others had the run of ,  more or less .  One of its rooms was given over to chess - playing ,  a pastime enjoyed by Rosengarten and Leonard .  After the second or third week of starting his course , Leonard <head>asked</head> to speak to Professor Dudek , and showed him some of his own poetry . He was aware that the professor was deeply involved in the burgeoning poetry movement of Canada ,  chiefly in the form of the little books and magazines which were in the van of the movement .  Dudek was surprised at the request ;  it was not a course designed to deal with such matters .

We lived for it ,  in between homes and restaurants .  Significantly ,  he adduced the work of the American poet Wallace Stevens at this point ,  a man torn between the profession of law and the poetic muse ,  whose view of lost faith and a disconnected tradition imbued his poetry with a wistfulness and a challenge that was taken very seriously by Leonard and Layton ;  or ,  perhaps ,  viewed by them as a satisfactory replacement .  As Layton <head>asked</head> in his poem To The Roaring Wind ( or was it to the Spirit - behind - the wind ? ) : What syllable are you seeking ,  Vocalissimus ,

And who ,  moreover ,  failed to differentiate between the artist and his art .  This is not to say that such comment is wholly wrong ;  merely to say that it lacks precision ,  finesse .  Leonard could be depressive along with many other poets ( the psycho - endocrinological critique of poetry has yet to be written ! ) ; he could also be uplifting and assertive ; he could , indeed , write about something to use Faulkner 's phrase from The Bear , and did so to the advantage of large numbers of people who gladly read , and <head>asked</head> for more . We must remember that this collection was put together in late 1955 ,  when most Jewish thinkers '  minds were somewhere between the atrocities of the Holocaust and the fearfully questionable use of the Bomb .  Further ,  Israel was now a reality  next year in Jerusalem for millions had been fulfilled ;  but the reaction of the Arab world was very  hostile  Suez was but months away ,  and glimmerings of its possibility  ( and worse )  were evident .
