Over a year or two ,  therefore ,  we have shifted from a population of recently diagnosed AIDS patients ,  often reasonably well but with lives dominated by a threat of pneumonia ,  to a population surviving longer and developing a range of further complex problems of a chronic debilitating nature .  As London 's  largest independent provider of community care for people ill with AIDS ,  staff at ACET have seen these changes unfold in the home .  While numbers of new AIDS cases reported officially each month have <head>remained</head> relatively steady , there has been a big increase in those needing expert medical and nursing advice at home with a 24 - hour on call back up. The numbers with pain are also higher .  Those at home often need opiates  ( morphine - like medicines )  for pain ,  while one in five will also need a special battery - operated syringe pump ,  especially if they are too weak to swallow .

The increase was even felt to be too great :  in 1964 ,  when British groups reached 212 ,  it was decided to slow down the growth in the UK  not to act upon the ephemeral  enthusiasms of an odd individual ,  but to go for quality .

Modern art historians strive to analyze ,  interpret ,  and evaluate works of art by identifying their materials and techniques ,  makers ,  time and place of creation ,  and meaning or function .  They inquire about the who ,  what ,  when ,  where ,  and why of the art object ;  often the object itself suggests which of these questions should be pursued .  But the function of art history today is not only to make such identifications , but also to relate an individual work humanistically to other works of the same school , period and culture , while <head>remaining</head> sensitive to its salient aesthetic qualities . According to this American guide ,  Art criticism is a many - levelled activity that comprises the historical ,  the recreative ,  and the judicial .  In all cases it seeks to pronounce value judgements ,  an exercise shunned by art history .

One can therefore conclude that there is a sense of unity throughout the catholic  nationalist population as a whole ,  though one in which certain groups ,  namely farming interests and the church ,  at both clerical and popular levels ,  have strategically dominated ,  at least until recently .  By 1914 ,  the protestant  loyalist group was well established and ready for war against catholic nationalists should it have proven necessary .  Issues of class conflict within the group were to <head>remain</head> largely subordinate , as the matter of the nature and defence of loyalism itself was to dominate the scene right down to the present day . There was to be an expression of a certain solidarity between members of both the catholic and protestant working classes in the Belfast demonstration of 1932 against the inadequate poor relief during the period of particularly high unemployment .  But such cooperation was rare and quickly taken over by sectarian issues .

This shows the extent to which the republican ideal gained ground once independence was in place ,  furthering the ideological divide between protestant loyalism and catholic nationalism .  Despite this development ,  the struggle between the two previously warring factions has continued ,  the original republicans developing a populist ,  nationalist party ,  and the former treaty party developing a concern with law and order ,  and moderation on the national question .  But the fight did not prevent the fundamental beliefs in the nation and the historic integrity of the island of Ireland , as nationalist parties described it in their New Ireland Forum ( 1983 4 : i . 28 ) , from <head>remaining</head> basic to the perceptions of both parties .

Local folk religion still continues in some forms .  Its resistance is exemplified by the recent moving statues devotional upsurge of 1985 in South - West Ireland ,  where statues of Mary were believed to have changed their posture ,  wept ,  and bled  ( Tobin 1985 )  .  National centres of devotion <head>remain</head> relatively strong the shrine to Mary at Knock , the annual climbing of Croagh Patrick , pilgrimage and penance at Lough Derg . In fact ,  whereas the parallel protestant movement of evangelical revival was for all people ,  and the issue tended to be decisive ,  catholic spirituality diverged on both points .  The principal one was that conversion and growth were particularly directed at the clerical - religious lite ,  where the annual retreat system formed the annual or biennial centre of the individual spiritual life .

Sodalities ,  such as the Legion of Mary ,  Opus Dei ,  and Christian Life communities ,  have partially extended this form of commitment to some ,  particularly more middle - class laity ,  and continue to have an important role in activating laity for what are judged to be religious goals both personally and socially .  But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed , with clergy being left behind in some areas , the clerics <head>remain</head> the true cognoscenti in religious matters , and are expected to be so by the laity . This has always added to the clergy 's  spiritual authority and status ,  and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals ,  with the high clergy deciding what constitutes matters of faith and morals .  The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life .

O'Carroll sees such positions exemplified by the protagonists '  refusal to accept that certain therapeutic abortions already permitted in Ireland were actually abortions and by their predictions of social chaos should they fail in their fight :  Hence phrases such as the opening of the floodgates ,  the thin end of the wedge ,  the slippery slope ,  the permissive society ,  and the abortion mentality  ( 1983 :  12 )  .  It is important to point out that these expressions which interpret Irish social reality and events are also used by the high clergy .  They are thus not simply a mentality derived from popular religion but from a traditional Roman catholicism which held sway in catholic Europe from the post - Reformation period and <head>remained</head> unchallenged until the 1960s . As will be seen in Chapter 5 ,  understanding this religious social consciousness requires some grasp of the traditional catholic teaching on the natural order and the good society ,  and how the nation is to respect the divine order  established by God .  An example of this can be taken from the recent contraception controversy in the Republic ,  which began in the 1960s .

If they who are elected to legislate for our society should unfortunately decide to pass a disastrous measure of legislation that will allow the public promotion of contraception and an access hitherto unlawful to the means of contraception ,  they ought to know clearly the meaning of their action ,  when it is judged by the norms of objective morality  and the certain consequences of such a law It may well come to pass that legislation could be enacted that will offend the objective moral law  .

The process of industrialization and the accelerated growth of the division of labour had already wrested from the family ,  including its rural variant ,  its monopolistic role in the processes of production .  The family had changed ,  and its various functions of education ,  food production ,  and the manufacture of clothing were already in part relinquished to a variety of institutions whose smooth functioning rested on the intervention and guidance of the nation state .  The change in the socio - moral context was hardly recognized , and the corresponding change in religious social ethics had <head>remained</head> unformulated . In the case of the Mother and Child scheme ,  it was rather through withdrawal from the scene that first the politicians and later the churchmen avoided further trouble .  As will be elaborated now in further contexts ,  it appears that the underlying reality to such difficulties was ,  and remains a complex contradiction which the catholic  nationalist alliance has still failed to solve .

The biggest percentages favouring the proposal occurred in the urban centres ,  particularly Dublin and Dublin County ,  where there was a slight margin in favour .  But the country areas and particularly the West were overwhelmingly against the proposal .  It would seem that catholic nationalist morality is to <head>remain</head> a feature of the Southern state and of any future all - Ireland state , if the clerical church 's wishes continue to prevail . If an effective will to de - alienate Northern protestants in their attitudes to the republic existed ,  and if there had been a real change in the Irish catholic hierarchy 's  position on such matters ,  then they would indeed have taken positive steps to support FitzGerald 's  attempt to introduce such constitutional changes .  In other words ,  on the divorce question the Roman catholic clerical leadership were still using their joint authority ,  which is legitimate in the eyes of the majority in the Southern state ,  to press into civil legislation their views of public morality ,  and to use the informed conscience of the faithful as the primary vehicle .

This <head>remains</head> a fact no matter how one seeks to explain or excuse it . It is largely the case that  catholic nationalists go to one set of schools which have a visible catholic and nationalist ethos ,  and protestant loyalists go to another ,  some of which have a less visible protestant ethos ,  but all of which have a loyalist ethos as well .  Some catholic nationalists in the South mix with a proportionally much larger number of Southern protestants who ,  however ,  are loyal to the Southern state .

As we shall see ,  there is now a specifically created police culture of the dramatic ,  which incorporates illusion ,  praxis ,  and imagery as part of a well - directed social production .  It rejoices in an enhanced belief in Manichaean and mythological archetypes of good and evil which are made manifest in exaggerated games of cops and robbers .  Series of interlinking metaphors of chaos and inhumanity are generated to maintain this dramatic mode and ensure that the agenda for control <head>remains</head> firmly with the system , and already I have used such metaphorical terms as animals and enemies to indicate some of the ways in which those in power make use of the rich imagination contained in everyday language . As Lakoff and Johnson  ( 1980 :  157 )  remind us :  whether in national politics or in everyday interaction ,  people in power get to impose their metaphors .  So when the police declare  ( as they do )  that they are non - political institution ,  this can only be a partial truth .

His ethnographic boundaries cannot be described as being geographically to the north of anywhere ,  for they are around him and within .  The insider who studies his own  society is really the anthropologist at home and he cannot move away .  Much of the recent writings on anthropology at home <head>remain</head> largely concerned with temporary visits by the academic to what is still the exotic world of out there . Usually the field trip is still an episodic visit to somewhere else ,  geographically to another culture from which the analyst can take leave or bring visitors too .  Returning to academia he can recall the spatial remove as being out there in the field ;  so that much of the current anthropology at home may still only be practising in its own backyard ,  pursuing an exploration of exotic cultures at home rather than looking into its own front room  ( Cheater 1987 :  166 )  .

In nightly theatrical TV rituals of social order and chaos ,  a stream of hero - policemen stand at the symbolic crossroads between peace and mayhem ,  and the detective and the chief officer now operate at the point where once the church and its priests declaimed on categories of good and evil and the resulting binary codes they produce .  Inevitably ,  as a secular interpretation of morality has superseded that of established religion ,  so the  activities of the social controller have become increasingly important in the drama .  It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have <head>remained</head> the province of the archbishop and his clergy . The immediate result is that alongside a few major clerics such as Runcie and Jenkins ,  we find that Stalker ,  Sampson ,  Anderton ,  Alderson ,  Newman ,  Imbert ,  Dear ,  Oxford ,  and Hermon are national personalities ,  while a second division of chief officers regularly proclaim on a range of subjects which at other times would lie outside the province of the police .  Yet Robert Reiner  ( 1989 )  ,  writing on the collective culture of chief constables ,  is the first to explore their extraordinary place in modern society ,  simply because as an lite among the powerful in society they have had little need to reveal how they operate ,  link together ,  or reveal what structures of significance guide their actions .

Claiming significant differences in post - PACE activities he suggested these showed the need for legal measures to impact upon police practice and influence change .  His observational sample of prisoner interviews ,  although small ,  had found the PACE codes of practice were followed to the letter and he argued this showed that it required the sanction of the law to effect changes in interview and interrogation techniques .  A detective inspector shrugged this off , arguing from practical mastery and insider 's knowledge , that the practices of doing the business <head>remained</head> undisturbed outside of the PACE interview . He accepted there was no question that the PACE interviews Irving had witnessed would have been carried out with exactitude ,  but was certain that the negotiation of justice could easily continue outside of the world of the written custody record or file of evidence .  The fact that a sociologist was witnessing the interviews make it all the more certain they would be conducted with scrupulous care ,  but there was no way he would be given access to the extra - legal deals which may well have gone on outside the interview room or later during a prison visit for write - offs .

It may also be the reason why ,  in its forty - year history ,  the Police Staff College has never achieved any real academic status ;  for ,  as Lewis  ( ibid .  183 )  also points out :  there is a deep feeling that academic training gets between a policeman and his knowing and getting the respect of the crude masses of a very crude ,  very egalitarian and anti - intellectual European race the police  have indeed a general belief that they know more psychology than academics .  Always the demand is for practical skills , while academic analysis <head>remains</head> a despised pastime , so that even the Superintendents ' Association ( the equivalent of the Police Federation for the lower ranks ) has similarly denied any place for intellectualism for its members . At their 1974 conference they decided :  It is time to end the service 's  love affair with education .  Although this conference comment is now well over fifteen years old it still holds good .

In 1988 a visiting colleague from the Royal Ulster Constabulary asked if it was part of my role in Systems Development Department to comment on such essays .  He told of his own difficulties in finding time to read all the variable essays submitted and knew of many that were never sent in at all .  For although Force Orders inevitably direct that such material will be submitted for assessment , it is typical that in a task - orientated institution which gives low priority or credence to the academic tome , the systems to ensure submission of the essays , or the ability to make much use of any useful ideas they contain , often <head>remains</head> sketchy . As the director of the Police Foundation ,  Barrie Irving  ( 1984 :  4 )  commented ,  Unlike their American counterparts ,  the British police community ,  together with their administrators ,  do not devour large quantities of written material and if a research project does not produce results which can be acted upon no amount of careful editing and dissemination will make an impact .  Research in the police ,  Irving further asserts ,  is a matter of pragmatics ,  eliminating philosophical enquiry into systems of belief ,  or how the knowledge of an ideology is transformed into action .

These were eventually formalized in the Weber - Fechner law which reported a quantitative relationship between stimulus and subjective experience ,  the sensation increasing in proportion to the logarithm of the magnitude of the physical stimulus .  A quantitative correlation between the objective intensity of stimulus and the pattern of neural activity was subsequently demonstrated by physiologists recording from individual fibres .  Since the work of S. S. Stevens in the 1930s and later , it has been recognized that , although the Weber - Fechner Law holds for many sorts of sensory experience , the exponent varies widely ; nevertheless , the principle of a quantitative correlation between external stimulus , neural activity and experienced sensation <head>remains</head> intact and now appears to be well - established . So much for the basic laws .  The repeated confirmation of the correlation between the physical characteristics of the stimulus and the characteristics of the neural activity it triggers ,  and between the characteristics of the stimulus and that of the subjective sensation ,  has encouraged the belief that our sensations are in some sense to be understood in terms of a set of stimulation levels  ( spiking frequencies )  in the appropriate sensory pathways .

On the positive side ,  a milestone was reached in 1984 when the old vacuum - braked wagonload network was finally abandoned and all worthwhile traffic transferred to the air - braked Speedlink system .  The principle of Speedlink is that train sections are exchanged at specified groups of sidings on the network ,  rather than individual wagons sorted at full - scale marshalling yards .  On certain routes Speedlink has served BR and its customers well , with many trunk trains running to capacity ; but the economics of running three - or fourwagon feeder services at the periphery of the network have <head>remained</head> questionable . Some worthwhile traffic gains were made during the 1980s ,  such as timber from the Scottish Highlands and drinks from several locations in the South West .  But equally notable were the losses ,  such as the once substantial Rowntrees traffic from York .

If the right foot <head>remains</head> there for several bars , the arms will be held still , but as soon as the left moves in front the arms will change .

A correctly fitting sack is essential to enjoyable walking ,  especially when carrying a heavy load and the SA harness and hip belt on the Condor have been beefed up a bit from the Jaguar and Panther models .  The SA system allows the shoulder straps to be adjusted up and down aluminium struts and held in place with straps and buckles , while the lumber support pad and hip belt <head>remain</head> stationary . A smaller SA system is available for people with smaller backs ,  but unfortunately not on the Condor .  Size is quickly adjusted with compression straps and full - length zipped gussets ,  although this system all adds to the sack 's  2.4kg .

And it should be noted that the actual breaking point for Raskolnikov in the novel is the  illness which induces his apocalyptic science - fiction nightmare of germs and Possessed   - type madness and destruction ,  bringing him literally to Sonya 's  feet and both of them to the dawn of a new future ,  of a full resurrection into a new life which will be the subject of another story .

Looked at another way ,  The Possessed  and the two remaining novels he had in him to write ,  A Raw Youth  and The Brothers Karamazov  ,  are all generation - gap stories ,  and for Dostoevsky the generation gap is only subordinately topical and tendentious and mixed up with Turgenev .  How much of the great - sinner project <head>remained</head> unachieved and how much dissolved itself into the books that in fact got written , can be debated endlessly .
