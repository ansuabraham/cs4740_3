The connoisseur also hopes to have in a drawing an authentic work by an artist 's  own hand ,  which in the case of an oil painting may not be so assured .  European studio practice from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century included the master 's  employment of assistants ,  and the use of specialists for parts of pictures ,  such as drapery or landscape .  Watercolours are also <head>treated</head> in surveys . Here the writer is likely to be a practitioner ,  and the approach may defer to the popularity of the medium as a pastime for amateurs .  Print - making has had the advantage of some careful scholars ,  but an excellent book is by a practitioner ,  Stanley Hayter .

Portnoy 's  Complaint  is a work of the furious imagination spoken of ,  and rendered debatable ,  in The Facts  .  It is seen in The Facts  to belong to the times in which the writer lived when he wrote the novel ,  when opposition to the Vietnam War ,  and to a President Johnson perceived as monstrous ,  took to the street - wisdom of a farcical obscenity .  The Facts is able to <head>treat</head> the historical conditioning of Portnoy 's Complaint in a way in which the novel itself was not in a position to do . It has the  benefit of hindsight .  But it would also appear to know its own place in history in a way which an exercise of the furious imagination in art can sometimes seem to prevent .

CAMRA is also concerned at the way in which many keg beers are brewed and the ingredients used .  Mashing ,  boiling and fermentation are often speeded up in large breweries using such devices as continuous fermentation and high gravity brewing ,  both of which produce standardised bland beers of mediocre quality .  In order to further speed and cheapen the process , inferior ingredients such as maize , rice , triticale , wheat flour and potato starch are used and helped on their way by chemicals that hasten fermentation , cut down on the yeast head in the vessels to allow more wort to be <head>treated</head> , and to give a lively fake head to the finished product . Beer is classified as a food stuff and yet it is excluded from the legal requirements to list ingredients .  Drinkers have a right to know whether the beer they are drinking is a genuine barley malt product or whether it is stuffed full of such tasty ingredients as corn syrup ,  propylene glycol alginate ,  amyloglucosidase ,  papain enzymes and potassium metabisulphite .

However ,  it is important to remember the gap .  My becoming homeless was not a result of my dropping out of a system which probably would have supported me until retirement age ;  it was the result of a chain of events which took place much ,  much later .  Blame me for becoming poor if you like I admit , I blew it but the responsibility for the way our society <head>treats</head> its poorer members is not exclusively mine . One immediate result of my departure from Berkeley was my giving up my flat by the school and going back to London .  I was disappointed to find that accommodation was scarcer and more expensive than I thought it would be and the best that I could afford was a large first - floor room in a bedsitter house on Ladbroke Grove .

If the glider gets wet before taking off for a high climb ,  the airbrakes may freeze up and become unusable .

Modern machines are blessed with a minimum of tail area and even a small coating on the leading edge of the tailplane may cause uncontrollable stability problems .  Probably for this reason most of the glass fibre gliders are not cleared by the manufacturers for cloud flying .

Thus because there are stomach muscles which operate vertically ,  diagonally and horizontally ,  complex bending and twisting movements are possible ,  and support for the vital abdominal organs is provided .

The case of Virgil is a crucial one For anyone for whom literary education  like any other  is an exploration of the meanings we have and live by ,  so far as we do live by meanings ,  Virgil and Dante are connecting rooms To talk of getting the full charge of the Divine Comedy or more modestly and exactly , the fullest charge the particular reader is capable of getting while <head>treating</head> Dante 's master as an irrelevance , is nonsense ; This is part of a polemic  ( reluctant ,  because in other contexts and on other grounds Sisson venerates Pound )  against Ezra Pound 's  treatment of Virgil :   there are such absurdities in Pound as the assertion that Gavin Douglas 's  excellent Aeneidos  is better than the original ,  together with other devaluings of Virgil '  For Eliot and Sisson it is unthinkable that one can venerate Dante without venerating Virgil ,  and vice - versa  ;  whereas Pound was firmly pro - Dante ,  and yet often raucously dismissive of Virgil .

One feature of English verse that is scanted by this method ,  or can be acknowledged only incidentally ,  is one that every careful reader knows from his or her experience :  tempo  ,  the speeding up or slowing down of enunciation ,  and therefore of apprehension ,  as we read through a line or through several lines in sequence .  This seems to be intimately connected with another principle ,  which is more radical and therefore more important :  that of quantity  ,  of syllables as being ,  in relation to their contiguous syllables ,  either long or short .  The variation between English - language speakers about what syllables , in effect what vowels , they <head>treat</head> as long or short , is so great that there can be no question of imposing on English verse a quantitative metre such as was used for ancient Latin ( doubtless with some strain for those who spoke classical Latin with dialectal variations as to quantity ) . This granted ,  it remains true ,  as anyone 's  experience of his own and others '  speech - habits will confirm ,  that some English vowels are experienced and expressed as relatively long ,  others as relatively short .  Not just unmetrical poets like Pound  ( for the most part )  and Bunting ,  but also a strictly metrical poet like the later Yvor Winters ,  came to think that the finest auditory effects in English - language verse were attained by those poets who attended to the quantitative elements in British or American speech as an incalculable dimension super - added to the recognized and calculable dimensions of syllable - count and stresscount .

The GDR 's  acceptance as a real country has been the function of the Cold War ,  a piece of make - believe reflecting tacit agreement by both blocs that the German Question is best put on hold .

Mortified ,  all the other political leaders voted to change the rules to exclude the far - right MEPs from their new posts ,  especially after it was discovered that Mr Le Pen 's  man for Israel was likely to be from West Germany 's  Republicans ,  led by an ex - SS officer ,  Franz Schonhuber .  Mr Le Pen launched a tirade of Nazi terminology , suggesting that his MEPs were being <head>treated</head> as Untermenschen . When the ruling was announced yesterday ,  Bruno Gollnisch ,  a European Right MEP ,  shouted Dictator ,  dictator at the Parliament 's  president ,  Enrique Baron ,  and called other MEPs Gestapo men .  When officials tried to eject him ,  Mr Gollnisch tried to punch his neighbours .

AN ACID house fan died when she collapsed in a fit and suffered liver failure after taking a single ecstasy tablet ,  an inquest was told yesterday .  Collette Margaret McCarthy ,  21 ,  a receptionist ,  never recovered consciousness and ,  despite a liver transplant ,  died on 16 August ,  16 days after taking the amphetamine - based hallucinogen ,  Southwark Coroner 's  Court in south London was told .  After the hearing , Dr Bernard Portmann , a pathologist from King 's College Hospital , where Ms McCarthy was <head>treated</head> , said the case was highly unusual . Liver failure was not normally associated with amphetamines ,  which could induce fits and coma ,  he said .  The death suggested a possible previously unrecognised side - effect of ecstasy .

There was a drafting meeting yesterday and discussions are under way in a Council of Ministers working group and various committees of the European Parliament .  The directive  which is quite separate from the proposals for vetting large takeovers from the point of view of competition  is in itself uncontroversial .  It requires member states to set rules on mandatory bids , providing information to shareholders and <head>treating</head> them equally . All of this is already covered in the Takeover Code .  The problem is over who administers the rules .

Mrs Thatcher was at pains to emphasise the Government 's  commitment to the National Health Service .  In every year since I became Prime Minister ,  more money has been spent on the health service .  In every year , more doctors and nurses have been recruited and more patients <head>treated</head> . These are the actions of a Government determined to make the health service one of the best in the world .  The NHS will not be privatised .

Most of the constraints ,  however ,  are informal .  With relatively so few policewomen ,  the occupational culture of the force is heavily masculine ,  and the wider cultural values that exist in Northern Ireland generally make men more conservative in their attitudes towards gender and sex roles .  This not only affects how the male public react to policewomen in the province , it also influences how male colleagues <head>treat</head> policewomen in the work environment and the sorts of duties they are assigned in practice ; and the dearth of senior female officers makes it easy for male colleagues to impose such limits on the role of policewomen . The focus here will be on the way gender structures routine police duties ,  with more general issues concerning women in the RUC being developed elsewhere .   The view is widespread among the senior officers we talked to ,  and among ordinary policemen ,  that policewomen ,  as women ,  have instincts and capabilities which make them better suited to specific types of police work .

It was their first baby ,  tao .  ( FN 16/3/87 ,  pp. 31 -  2 )  It is not that policemen and women fail to achieve emotional detachment , even though one policeman once remarked that at postmortems he was appalled by the way pathologists <head>treat</head> the body simply as a lump of meat and fail to show respect ( FN 17/12/87 , p. 15 ) . Primarily what makes this type of work unpopular is the ever - present danger that work of this sort will break the veneer of coldness ,  exposing them as emotionally involved ,  which is something they dislike because it is considered unprofessional .  A third type of work which is disliked is work that risks displaying incompetence .

The view of senior management is that policemen need to combine the qualities of compassion and toughness and know when each is appropri  ate  ( FN 11/11/87 ,  pp. 78 )  ,  although in practice it is difficult to strike this fine balance .  Where it is seen by work colleagues to be getting out of kilter ,  informal controls can be used to restore equilibrium .  Thus , some policemen are urged by their tough - minded colleagues to <head>treat</head> marginal incidents as criminal behaviour and are encouraged into action . The reverse is equally evident ,  for informal controls sometimes operate to moderate the actions of those members of the RUC who see themselves as Rambo in police uniform .  The satirical phrase used to embarrass the Action Men is that they have the John Wayne syndrome ;  the fact it is Wayne rather than Rambo who is used to ridicule them gives a clue that it tends to be the older members of the force who use the term to describe the exuberant younger policemen .

It is also structured by the biographical situation of the person using the term and the definitions they give to their work role .  To some constables common sense is knowing how to talk to people :  You 've got to be able to talk to people on their own level , you get the best out of people if you <head>treat</head> them a certain way . Like ,  I 'd say to a young officer ,  maybe just out of the depot training centre ,  if a old lady calls you for assistance to her ,  you 're a police officer and she will look to you for help ,  ad we have to leave people with a certain level of satisfaction .

It was the result of efforts to transfer product systematically from developed to less developed economies ,  while at the same time retaining the essentially American management style of strong planning ,  coordination and control from the centre .  What Bartlett and Ghoshal refer to as the global company is alleged to be the result of Japanese practice developed in the 1960s and 1970s .  Lower trade barriers permitted their development , and Japanese government restrictions on overseas investment encouraged companies that <head>treated</head> markets on a global basis and benefitted from economies of scale . According to Bartlett and Ghoshal ,  the transnational company is meant to be the vehicle for international marketing of the 1990s that integrates the strengths of the three former culturally - dependent types of company .  To some extent the difference between this view and the developmental approach is one of semantics :  the term global company does not mean the same to each .

However ,  it is important to recall the full list ,  in order to emphasize the factors that did not  influence perceptions .  Whether people noticed the publication of opinion polls ,  whether they noticed local and national politicians ,  whether they noticed campaign themes  these seem relatively pure perceptions .  No doubt a few <head>treated</head> awareness as implied approval , but for most people that did not seem to be so . Perceptions of opinion polls changed dramatically during the campaign .  In the pre - campaign week only 56 per cent had seen a recent opinion poll but this rose to 72 per cent in the first fortnight of the campaign and 77 per cent in the second .

THE MOBILIZING IDEAL Views differ about the proper relationship between the mass media and society .  When the invention of the printing press first allowed mass production of political pamphlets and newsletters , British governments <head>treated</head> them as seditious libels which challenged their sovereign authority and fomented public disorder . In more recent times the behaviour of British governments has been more restrained and more sophisticated ,  but their  instincts and suspicions remain .  Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin accused the press of wanting power without responsibility ,  the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages .
