Another significant development to emerge from the latest session of the Commission ,  held in March 1991 ,  was its decision to establish a Working Group on arbitrary detention .  This will be the first UN mechanism with a clear mandate to examine cases of detained prisoners of conscience anywhere in the world .  It will fill an <head>important</head> gap in the framework of protection established by the Commission 's existing theme mechanisms on disappearances , torture and summary or arbitrary executions . However ,  it was disappointing that a new international instrument on disappearances was held over for further study .  Another new instrument that the Commission will be considering next year is a revised draft of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture ,  which would set up an international system of visits to places of detention ,  aimed at preventing torture and ill - treatment .

He described this aesthetic response as the bed - rock of conservative criticism .  For him ,  critical writing has to take up wider issues than enjoyment of a picture or a sculpture .  A different sort of response to art is to use it as a means of learning more about the society in which it was produced ; this may be felt by a theoretician to be more <head>important</head> than to know the artist 's intentions , which , it can be argued , are determined by society . Or ,  the effect of a painting may be compared with those of other means of communication ,  such as photography ,  film or television .  there is every reason to welcome such studies ,  though a reader hoping for judgements about quality may be disappointed by a theoretical writer 's  greater stress on interpretation .

As in books on the philosophy of art ,  or aesthetics ,  many do not in fact contain any art criticism ,  in the sense of description ,  interpretation and judgement of individual works .  Their strengths are rather in clearing the ground of preconceived ideas about the arts ,  and putting new points of view .  When works of art are described only those aspects of an image <head>important</head> to the argument are included . It is in this arena that some of the fiercest intellectual fighting about art is taking place ,  though the contests range wider than the visual arts to politics and economics .  For example ,  Chadwick states :  There can be no simple category defined as feminist art history ,  since the effect of new ideas is that much recent scholarly writing has shifted attention from the categories art and artist to broader issues concerning ideologies of gender ,  sexuality ,  and power .

In an art museum works can be studied at leisure ,  and will receive attention from scholars and experts of many kinds .

One of the <head>important</head> features of museum collections is the function they have as touchstones of quality and authenticity . paradoxically ,  it is in museums that the market in art is defined ,  since permanent collections place limits on what is available for collectors to purchase .  Further ,  on the basis of knowledge about museum collections ,  artists can find help in choosing ways of developing the art of the present .

What relationship exists between the painting and the vision of reality that the artist has before his eyes ?  At no time have I believed that environment is a complete explanation of art .  I am sure , however , that it plays an <head>important</head> role . The photographs were taken over a period of ten years ,  and eventually they were brought together in a book in 1960 ;  ten of the book 's  essays originally appeared in Vogue  ,  where the appealing mix of an artist 's  conversation along with Liberman 's  descriptions and commentary  succeeded well .

At the end of the twentieth century group exhibitions perhaps do not have the importance that they have had earlier in the century .  There are many galleries through the world ,  and it is no longer so difficult for an artist to show work independently .  Solo shows and mixed exhibitions are more common , with the group show playing a less <head>important</head> role in the market . Artists who group together for financial reasons may choose a name which is no more explanatory than a number or numbers .  Thus in London at different times there have been groups which have called themselves the Society of Twelve  ,  the Seven and Five  ,  and One/Four  .

There are other ways of description ,  which may incidentally be employed by a critic ,  or can be useful to a reader as a check on the validity of a verbal description .  In chapter 4 ,  on monographs ,  there were some comments on the photography of art as a complement to criticism ;  there are some other issues about how accurate or misleading photographs can be .  Perhaps this is the more <head>important</head> in the late twentieth century now that this means of image - making is so familiar that some people actually imagine that a photograph shows the world as it is . In truth ,  the camera is a ruthless editor of visual information ;  this can be made plain by looking at a picture ,  say of the eighteenth century ,  and comparing it with a contemporary print ,  perhaps an aquatint ,  and a modern photograph .  The images carry different information .

The same angle was conspicuous in the title story of Naipaul 's  previous book ,  In a Free State  ,  where a coup in a new African country was studied ,  as it were ,  out of the corner of an eye ;  and it also occurs elsewhere in his work .  On these occasions the eye discerns a kind of visibility in an area of darkness :  this ,  in fact ,  is the title of the book which records Naipaul 's  experience of India .  Enthusiasts for explanation , however , might want to explain that this darkness visible tends to obscure and diminish what deserves to be understood , and that , for him , there are <head>important</head> countries and unimportant countries , and that the coups and riots of the latter are severely diminishable . Here ,  he surrounds the politics of his imaginary country with darkness ,  distinguishes between its politics and what might be seen as the antics of bystanders ,  and concentrates on these bystanders .  At the same time ,  the reader can be made to feel that ,  on closer inspection ,  the country 's  politics might prove to be antics too .

Kelman stands much closer to the new hero ,  and more is made of what happens in that hero 's  head .

So you want to be an Actor ?  Everyone who wants to act professionally should try to see as much drama as they possibly can  and this means in the broadest sense ,  watching television ,  cinema ,  visiting the theatre and looking at the actor 's  work carefully and analytically .  It is also <head>important</head> that you try and evaluate the dramatic experience of these different forms of presentation this is worthwhile , because it will make you think about the different ways in which an actor can work and the various ways in which his skills are used . Clearly ,  there is a difference in scale and dimension between the stage ,  the television screen and the cinema screen ,  which demand changes in direction and in acting technique .  One of the things you will notice when watching the television is that close - ups are used very effectively ,  and so it is of vital importance that the actor has absolute control over his/her face and expression .

Novels have been a rich source of material for the film industry since the talkies were introduced ,  and it 's  very interesting to see how both classic and contemporary novels require skilled adaptation of the dialogue to make sufficient dramatic impact in a film .

It 's  true that extracts such as Phoebe 's  Think not that I love him from As You Like It   ( Act 3 ,  Scene 5 )  or Viola 's  1 left no ring with her from Twelfth Night   ( Act 2 ,  Scene 2 )  may be all too well known to a panel ,  but I cannot agree with an adjudication policy that would ban these pieces from the audition .  The selection is right if it truly works for the competing student ,  and it is the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the performance of the piece .  The most <head>important</head> thing is your firm knowledge that the selection is within your present range . It 's  not much use arriving somewhere at ten in the morning clutching the collected works under your arm and wishing you had a wig and been born thirty years earlier in order to play Lear  or for that matter the Duke of Gloucester .  Major roles for older women are not so common in Shakespeare ,  but I think it is better not to choose a character such as Queen Katherine from Henry VIII  ,  who needs a richness of seniority to convey the dramatic interest .

Finding characters for yourself will ,  1 think ,  depend a good deal on your personal taste in theatre at the time you are auditioning .  And your choice of audition piece is often largely decided by the contrast it provides with the classical selection you have made .  The question of accent is <head>important</head> too you need to be confident of the accent with which you are working , and it is always advisable to present an accent you are familiar with or at least can work with comfortably . The first piece of advice that 's  necessary is that you should n't just try to be fashionable by choosing juicy speeches that catch your eye without knowing the whole play and having a working idea of how to perform the speech .  And do n't let your search for material lead you to choose the obscure for obscurity 's  sake ,  so you feel you will be sure to stun the panel with a piece that has no good professional background .

For example ,  if you are embarking on Julia in Two Gentlemen of Verona  and her Proteus letter ,  it is as well to have a sheet of paper that you can tear up to make the scene start with a dramatic focus and give the lines some action .  Learning thoroughly the piece which you are going to do is <head>important</head> .

Throughout drama school there will be continuous work on acting solo pieces ,  and both singing and acting tutorials are usually conducted on a one to one basis  ( more on tutorials in chapter 7 )  .  Of course the student also needs to learn how to co - ordinate dialogue with all of the necessary actions and movements which are part of the natural traffic of performance ,  and learn about prop handling .

The new actor is generally operating in top gear and if this momentum is stopped it can be very damaging to the morale and can result in an actor 's  technical skills going rusty  something to be avoided at all costs .  To speak of further training programmes now may sound like a mere desperate remedy ,  but it does n't mean anything as arduous or as expensive as the full training of your drama school .  Actors who are serious about their work always look on the voice and movement class as an <head>important</head> part of their life .

The voice and movement work is very important but the professional requirements have changed ,  particularly in respect of film and television and there should be more training in this area .  We had next to none when I was at drama school and young actors need to know more about what will be expected of them on film sets and television studios .  And young actors have a greater instinct these days for film than they do for the stage , though this is not to say that stage training is not equally <head>important</head> ; nevertheless as working actors we are getting more and more camera conscious in our acting and will continue to do so .
