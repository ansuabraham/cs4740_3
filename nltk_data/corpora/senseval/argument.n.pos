Her National Gallery choices of pictures were examples of problems posed to artists by colour ,  and in a video talk she demonstrated how these artistic problems had been solved .  Connections with her own practice as a painter were evident ,  even though her abstract compositions were very different in subject from the works of her chosen artists ,  who included Veronese and Poussin .  Her <head>argument</head> was that the subjects of the old master paintings could be disregarded by a painter who wished to find lessons for the present in the artistic practice of the past . Bridget Riley had no intention of either presenting an account of Poussin 's  aims and procedures ,  or of demonstrating Veronese 's  debts to his predecessors in Venetian art ,  as a historian would have felt a duty to do .  The artist as critic in this case deliberately avoided the historical context  of the pictures she was discussing .

If a critic has a very decided political or religious point of view ,  this can override other considerations in judgements about art ;  the viewpoint may also give a bias to the description or interpretation made .  A remarkable Marxist interpretation ,  for example ,  was made of Florentine painting from Giotto 's  time to the fifteenth century ,  by Frederick Antal in the 1940s .  Later writers , even those sympathetic to Antal 's thesis , have admitted that the <head>argument</head> about class conflict in the period was exaggerated , but this does not exclude the possibility that an equally unexpected approach may not throw light on some apparently exhausted topic . Of course ,  a theorist may damage an argument through bias ,  perhaps excluding relevant evidence inconvenient to the case being made ;  but this is not a danger exclusive to theorists .  Omissions are most patent perhaps in surveys made with a political bias .

As in books on the philosophy of art ,  or aesthetics ,  many do not in fact contain any art criticism ,  in the sense of description ,  interpretation and judgement of individual works .  Their strengths are rather in clearing the ground of preconceived ideas about the arts ,  and putting new points of view .  When works of art are described only those aspects of an image important to the <head>argument</head> are included . It is in this arena that some of the fiercest intellectual fighting about art is taking place ,  though the contests range wider than the visual arts to politics and economics .  For example ,  Chadwick states :  There can be no simple category defined as feminist art history ,  since the effect of new ideas is that much recent scholarly writing has shifted attention from the categories art and artist to broader issues concerning ideologies of gender ,  sexuality ,  and power .

They may ,  however ,  not be exactly what the author would have preferred ,  as a colour plate which is readily available  ( perhaps having been used in another publication )  is much cheaper to use than a new plate which has to be commissioned .

The standards which can be obtained in colour reproductions today are high ,  but not always attained .  Comparison of illustrations of the same picture in several publications will demonstrate this truism ,  while the best test of looking at a reproduction in front of the picture itself can be a disheartening experience .

In all capitalist democracies there are two sources for the legitimacy of the state ,  namely statehood itself and the ideology specific to the state in question .  It will be argued that when the second source is threatened as well as the first ,  the power to coerce can devolve on the civil sphere in a substantive way .  The conclusion to the <head>argument</head> will be that there is a specific form of violence of a political kind outside of state control which cannot be reduced to crime . The specificity of this form of violence or coercion has to be recognized ,  however one feels about the terrible consequences of it for the innocent .  This form of political violence requires political answers and not just an anti - criminal ,  police - oriented ,  coercive response .

Covenant theology itself empowers the people to take action against the state in certain and specific circumstances ,  and Ian Paisley and many of his supporters both within and without the Orange order have frequently used bully - boy tactics ,  and approved paramilitary processions ,  marching ,  and drilling .  From Carson to Paisley one finds the argument that it is legitimate to fight to regain one 's  fundamental freedom if the sovereign with whom one has  covenanted one 's  allegiance betrays that allegiance and conducts one into slavery .  The <head>argument</head> is clearly inspired by a religious motivation and shows Ulster protestantism to be a vigorous form of political religion , approving whatever defensive measures are necessary to avoid submission to Rome rule. Ulster protestantism is not contained within churches but spills out on to the streets .  Religion is also involved in the violence indirectly .

Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the whole affair is the way Dr Browne handled it .  The members of his party appeared to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the earlier Bill ,  and Dr Browne only found out in October/November 1950 .  When he was told of the hierarchy 's opposition to any bill of this kind , Dr Browne , himself secularly inclined , submitted his proposals and <head>arguments</head> to the hierarchy for approval , just as a previous Health Minister , Dr Walsh , had consulted Archbishop McQuaid on a similar matter in 1946 . If a man of such convictions felt it necessary to follow this course ,  how much more would have his religiously  devoted colleagues .  In fact ,  his cabinet colleagues ,  already unsure about public support for the bill and alienated from Dr Browne by his provocative politics ,  were not prepared to go against the hierarchy 's  condemnation and refused to support the proposal .

But they did and still do remain the authoritative conscience of the nation .  In addition ,  the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships ,  doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues .  Part of the overall <head>argument</head> of this book is that , as the Roman catholic church is principal validator or legitimator of the Southern state along with the concept of the national entity , what that state goes on to do in the field of social ethics cannot be separated out from the responsibilities of the church . This structural link between politics and religion is underlined by the legitimacy the church gives to the state as a whole ,  by recognizing it simply as society .  However ,  it is the further legitimation given to a particular socio - ethical form of political religion in the constitution and to the implied authority of religious intellectuals in deciding in concreto  what must be taken by the state as in the interests of the common good which gives to conflict in Ireland between the two alliances its political religious dimension in the sphere of law.

This was the line already adopted by Binchy  ( 1984 )  who interpreted world - wide statistics in this direction .  Divorce was seen to be harder on the women than the men ,  who could get out of their family  responsibilities so much more easily with divorce than without it .  In opposing the <head>arguments</head> marshalled by the anti - divorce groups , the pro - divorce group argued that , despite the existence of divorce legislation in Northern Ireland , there was still a low divorce rate . The period of separation in undefended cases was two years ,  and five years had to run if one of the parties opposed the divorce .  That men in particular do not benefit from the procedures was suggested by the fact that twice as many women as men filed for divorce .

One might be forgiven for thinking that the bishops letter had something to do with it and that Haughey was intent on constructing an alliance between those heeding the teaching of the hierarchy and the party faithful .  In early May ,  two - thirds of Fianna Fil TDs from the West had already indicated they would campaign in their constituencies against the amendment  (  Irish Times  ,  2 May 1986 )  .  The Woods ' speech also introduced an important new <head>argument</head> which may have had some considerable effect on Irish voters . It suggested that second marriages would substantially infringe the rights of inheritance of the members of the first family .  In a society of extremely strong rural ,  traditional values on rights of inheritance ,  the suggestions that constitutional Frankensteins would devour constitutional orphans  (  Dil Debates  ,  14 May 1986 )  were clearly calculated to raise a moral panic ,  having produced the appropriate folk - devils .

In the debates over the last twenty years there has been considerable interplay of theological and sociological reasoning ,  with social scientists also contributing to papers and discussions .  What has been seen as an aspect of the Roman catholic intellectual opposition to divorce in Chapter 5 can also be recognized as a feature of the defence of catholic schools too :  the opposition contains an interpretation of the moral nature of contemporary society and of what happens to catholics who are not to some degree protected from it .  In this writer 's view , the <head>arguments</head> against multi - denominational education and in favour of catholic schools support an overall political theology which is strongly based on authority within the church . Hierarchy and clergy are seen almost to monopolize the teaching and wisdom about life .  They are both directors of souls and minders of the public conscience .

Irish bishops have been well aware of Spencer 's   ( 1968 )  research .  Using traditional measures of religiosity ,  he has pointed out the apparent failure of English catholic schools to produce better catholics and fewer ex - catholics than state or  other schools ,  and has inferred the likelihood of the same for Irish schools .  Spencer 's <head>argument</head> has been banded about from time to time . This is not unnatural ,  as in the 1970s and early 1980s Spencer was at the Queen 's  University ,  Belfast ,  and an active member of the All Children Together Movement .  Support for this line of approach has been found in Greeley and Rossi 's   ( 1966 )  survey in the USA on the effectiveness of catholic schools .

In the light of W. McCready 's  findings in another study that the religious behaviour of the father had a greater impact on children ,  Greeley considered the fact that catholic schools were having an increasing influence on men to be of significant importance for the future of Roman catholicism in the USA  ( 1976 :  1735 )  .  Clearly ,  the follow - up study was more favourable to the defenders of catholic schools than to opponents .  However , Greeley and Rossi 's work also has been used to uphold the defenders ' <head>argument</head> that , though Roman catholic schools varied in their efficiency , they were certainly better than any possible alternative in terms of producing good Roman catholics . Thus ,  both sides have tended to use social scientific research to make statements in general about catholic schools which have been drawn from other countries and ,  therefore ,  beyond the cultural confines within which Irish catholic schools exist .  This is something  for which surveys ,  including that of Greeley and Rossi ,  are not and cannot be intended .

A black - box approach to the schooling process was used with no direct investigation of processes within the schools .

But the central and substantive argument that defenders of Roman catholic schools have had to deal with is that the dual school system in Northern Ireland encourages ,  supports ,  or at least reinforces the sectarian divide ,  and that it forms part of the vicious circle maintaining conflict in Ulster .

Traditionally in anthropology ,  the ethnographer has studied a social system or culture through a period of intensive participant observation in the field .  This has generated considerable concern about the ethnographic experience itself ,  and specifically about the subjective nature of the process .  Unlike the natural sciences , where discussion often starts with the results and ignores the methodology of the research , the social sciences and increasingly anthropology have developed an elaborate <head>argument</head> about the practices of doing research . The interpretation of culture and even the ability to understand what is happening in the society under scrutiny as well as the need to grapple with political or ethical questions are all endless and fundamental problems of the moment  ( Phillips 1973 :  78 )  .  Mere observation and reporting is inadequate ,  given the limited scope of things which can be truly observed  ( Holy 1984 :  25 )  .

Its status or  ( as importantly )  its lack of value creates complex systems of meaning which are rarely articulated ;  for the police world has similar strictures to that which Benedict  ( 1967 )  described in her attempts to understand the rigidities of Japanese culture :  men who have accepted a system of values by which to live ,  cannot without courting in - efficiency and chaos keep for long a fenced - off portion of their lives where they think and behave according to a contrary set of values .

A good proportion of our work concerned our availability to act as an unacknowledged arm of the social welfare service to drug users in crisis situations ,  providing a front - line service for the speed freaks who 's  OD 'd on the results of a bent script ,  or the acid heads having a bad trip ,  for we were in the streets ,  the pubs ,  the clubs ,  the crash pads ,  and communal houses frequented by the new alternative society .  Much of our daily work was ten years in advance of the official police community involvement programmes and yet our actions were only an extension of those social welfare activities the police have been heavily involved in for generations ,  but which are never given status as real police work simply because of the institutional emphasis placed upon summons lists ,  numbers of arrests ,  crime detections ,  and other statistical returns .  Many of our new counter - cultural deviants were articulate and presented very cogent <head>arguments</head> relating to their allegedly victimless crimes . For example ,  they would link their cannabis use and an alternative ideology or religious vision to challenge our somewhat static version of social reality .

Since these states of affairs are of the essence of human perceptual consciousness and ,  therefore ,  of the human mind ,  it must follow that there are non - physical states of affairs essential to the human mind .  So a materialist theory of the mind is false .  The most primitive physicalist response to this <head>argument</head> is to deny the claim that there is anything about the mind that BS does not know . All that BS lacks is an ability to respond directly to stimuli of certain sorts :  V knows no more than BS ,  he can simply do something BS cannot .  BS is like a man who knows all about swimming ,  even to the point of being able to train the Olympic team ,  but who cannot swim himself ,  and V is the man with the normal talent for swimming .

We cannot ,  therefore ,  leave it as an irreducible fact about different physical processes that they feel different .  In fact , the mode of access <head>argument</head> is ambiguous . It might be interpreted as saying that V has a mode of access to his own brain different from any modes of access to V 's  brain available to BS ;  or that V has a different mode of access to the external world ,  and that this constitutes the difference between him and BS .  It is impossible to deny that V has a different mode of access to the external world from BS ,  for V can see and BS cannot .

It would make no sense to say that the dots in the picture had a Gestalt  of themselves ,  but to apply this model to the brain and experience would be just like that ;  for ,  if the experience just is  a state of the brain ,  then there is no way in which the character of the experience can be explained as the result of some perspective on  the brain .  Nor ,  more abstractedly ,  could it be the result of a perspective on the informational content of the brain ;  for ,  in either case ,  the perspective would have to be the occurrence of some further brain or informational state and to both of these the scientist has complete access ,  and the problem reoccurs .  If what I said above is correct , failure of the mode of access <head>argument</head> forces the materialist to deny that BS lacks any knowledge and to adopt a behaviourist theory . When a behaviourist approach is employed ,  it is not applied only to perception ,  but to all cognitive states .  Remembering that philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth century had already assimilated thought to perception ,  this is not surprising .

First ,  an objector might try to press the fashionable distaste for the first - person perspective and say that the fact that I cannot apply the theory to myself shows nothing except that one should not approach the philosophy of mind via the first person .  A philosophical theory is essentially a reflection on a practice ,  and the first - person perspective expresses engagement in the practice :  to apply the theory first - personally is to confuse levels .  This is a spurious <head>argument</head> . A philosophical account gives the necessary and sufficient conditions  ( at least in outline form )  for the application of a concept ,  and it should ,  therefore ,  apply in principle to anything that is a case of that concept .  If it really is the case that all I am doing when I have beliefs about the world is to have dispositions to behave ,  then it ought to make sense for me to think of my believing in those terms .

In showing that cognition as a whole cannot be treated behaviouristically ,  I have not thereby shown that a behaviouristic treatment of sense - experience is false .  So perhaps my overkill misses the target :  perhaps the behaviourist analysis of perception is sound ,  even though a general behaviourism is not ,  and what BS lacks is not knowledge of the nature of certain mental states ,  but only the ability to respond spontaneously to visual stimuli ,  that is ,  to respond as a result of actually seeing them .  Reflection on the nature of the <head>argument</head> against behaviourism in general , however , reveals that the argument refutes the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular . That argument showed that knowledge of the external world cannot be reduced to behavioural dispositions ,  for the very idea of a disposition functions only in the context of an unreduced grasp on the physical world .  But there is nowhere else that we might get our conception of the physical world from ,  other than perception .

There are ,  though ,  a host of reasons for resisting any kind of equation between mental representations and mental pictures ;  and all of these derive from one fundamental reason .  Any mental picture will require interpretation ,  and this interpretation will be another mental operation ,  which ,  on the view that thinking is having mental pictures ,  will be another picture ,  which itself will require interpretation ,  and so on and so on .  This may look like an easy knock - down <head>argument</head> against a silly theory which nobody has ever seriously held : but what is true of mental pictures would seem to be true of any kind of mental representing process which encodes sensations in some determinate form . In other words ,  the argument works equally against the view that we think in a kind of mental language ,  that mental sentences rather than mental pictures are the stuff of thought .  Sentences and words also require interpretation  indeed they would seem to require this more obviously than pictures  and so we 're back on the circle of infinite regress .

But this is a fairly repugnant conclusion to most of us .  Do we really want to say that all we ever learn we knew before  even if we are  saying this in some technical computational sense ?  How about a more modest version of the <head>argument</head> which says that only certain primitive concepts are innate ( about three - dimensionality , causal relations , etcetera ) , and that the more sophisticated concepts develop out of these through the time - honoured processes of differentiating finer concepts from global ones and integrating the results into complex , structured concepts . This is not much help because  ( a )  later - developing concepts must still on the representational theory of the mind  be present in these primitive concepts  ( there are no merely potential competences  such as my potential but non - existing competence to know Portuguese )  ;  and  ( b )  how and where do we draw the line between the primitive concepts and the developed ones ?  Predictably ,  perhaps ,  I regard this argument not as a demonstration that the acquisition of new concepts is impossible ,  but as another reductio ad absurdum  of the representational theory of the mind .

I would not say that the developmental view is a consequence of the thoughtaction analogy exactly ,  because there could be constructivist theories that do not mention development .

So why not say ,  then ,  that in development perception teaches action ,  that as the information delivered up by the input systems becomes progressively richer the infant becomes better able to direct his own movements ,  rather than saying that cognisance develops out of action ?  My answer to this point will be more philosophical than empirical .  It will rely upon an <head>argument</head> from Kant . In the Critique of Pure Reason  ,  Kant 's  aim was to show how objective experience is possible ,  to set out the conditions necessary for this ;  whilst Piaget 's  aim was to show ,  given certain Kantian assumptions ,  how objective experience  actually develops .  One of the conditions for ascribing to oneself experiences of a mind - independent reality ,  Kant argued ,  was that we should be capable of distinguishing between those sequences of perceptions  ( if you like ,  representations delivered up by the input systems )  which are determined by the movement of objects and those which are determined by our own movements .

I argued that the representational theory of mind ,  with its assumption that thinking is the possession of determinate mental states which are in some sense encodings  ( pictorial ,  syntactic )  of actual or possible states of affairs ,  contributes to the difficulty of the mind - body problem .

I How might such states be both mental and physical at the same time ?  We do not want to say that one kind of state causes the other kind ,  but neither does it make much sense to say that they are parallel or identical .  There are <head>arguments</head> for all possible positions , but none of them convinces us for long ( see chapters 1 and 5 ) . Recall that constructivism refers only to mental representations at  the level of the input systems ,  as entities which can be translated ,  more or less directly ,  into the language of neuropsychology .

Most ,  perhaps all ,  functionalists are thorough - going materialists who believe that mental phenomena are genuine physical  phenomena seen at a particular level of abstraction .  This commitment to materialism means that a couple of standard dualist objections must be faced .  First , there is the dualist 's <head>argument</head> that mental processes cannot be physical processes because physical entities such as neurons - lack certain qualities such as intentionality or consciousness that characterize the mental . The response to this is that intentionality and consciousness are emergent properties  of physical systems .  Neurons do not individually have the property of consciousness ,  consciousness emerges when a large number of neurons are interacting in the right kind of way ;  just as speed  is a property not of any single component of a car ,  but an emergent property of the whole system  when it is operating in an appropriate way .

Furthermore ,  the work of Young and his colleagues ,  which I shall be discussing later in the chapter ,  shows that being aware of the operations of ,  say ,  one 's  face processing system has vitally important functional consequences .  However ,  the functionalist view is that it would be quite misguided to attempt to explain behaviour by making direct reference to the subjective  or phenomenal  qualities  ( technically known as qualia  )  of these mental states .  If it is really necessary to think of mental states as having qualitative content ( and see Dennett , 1988 , for some powerful <head>arguments</head> that it is not ) , then it follows from functionalism that such qualia do not have causal interactions with other mental states or behaviour and are mere epiphenomena .

This is the myth that I want to examine here .  Although the majority of scientists tend to be a little coy about metaphysical matters in their professional publications ,  they are often less so outside when writing elsewhere ,  being prone to describe the framework of presuppositions about perception within which they conduct their investigations as if it were a discovery in its own right and that discovery an explanation of perception .

Moreover ,  rather as substance dualism tends to do ,  it seems to undermine the causal role of consciousness in ,  for example ,  bringing about or influencing actions .  For the causal relations of events would be just the same irrespective of whether or not the causal chain temporarily took on a mental aspect  ( as in property dualism )  or  ( as in substance dualism )  went mental for a while .  A further telling <head>argument</head> against the dual aspect theory - and one that has been rarely noticed is that aspects are relative to viewpoints ; in other words , they emerge posterior to perceptions .

The monotony of the individual neurones is irrelevant ;  what matters is the infinite variety of their combinations ,  of their patterns ,  which will become evident when we look at the nervous system at the right level .  I shall deal with the language of neurophysiological description shortly .  However , it is necessary to say a word or two here to refute this seemingly compelling <head>argument</head> . We are so used to hearing talk about the nervous system encoding the outside world that it is easy to forget that this is a metaphor and it is one that has no place in serious philosophical discussion of the mind - body problem or the philosophy of perception .  The reason the coding metaphor has such currency in contemporary talk about perception is that it seems to suggest a way in which very simple and apparently homogenous  elements such as nerve impulses can generate the richness and variety of consciousness .

Controversy and <head>argument</head> attract notoriety .

The strapline above the story included the phrase mountaineering 's  image on slide .

Chunks of the Peak District are being gobbled up and we 're worried about the environmental implication of drilling a few tiny holes .

It is ,  however ,  written in a crusading spirit ,  without any critical distance ,  and it is informed ,  like Belsey 's  book ,  by the assumption that language  or literature  can give us no certain knowledge of the world .  Hawkes 's  polemical purpose becomes more and more apparent as the book develops :  it is to undermine ,  not only established literary study ,  but liberal humanism itself .  His <head>arguments</head> are fast - moving but inexact , and he engages in some wild flourishes of Hegelian grammar : Writing , in short , does not reproduce ' a reality beyond itself , nor does it reduce ' that reality . In its new freedom ,  it can be seen to cause a new reality to come into being   ( Hawkes 's  italics )  .  Or consider the density of trope and implication in the following :  New New Criticism would thus claim to respond to literature 's  essential nature in which signifiers are prised utterly free of signifieds ,  aiming ,  in its no - holds - barred  encounter with the text ,  for a coherence  and validity  of response ,  not objectivity and truth  ( Hawkes 's  italics )  .

As I have remarked ,  Culler 's  Structuralist Poetics  encouraged some readers to think in terms of rapprochement  between the New and the Newer Criticism .  Anthony Easthope 's  Poetry as Discourse  offers a complex blend of old and new .  He takes poststructuralist assumptions about the death of the author and the disappearance of the self - subsistent ego , and applies them to the history of English poetry , in a work which combines ingenious close reading , impressive knowledge of metre , and an overall <head>argument</head> of stratospheric thinness and remoteness . Easthope believes that the modernist concept of impersonality ,  later systematized in the New Criticism ,  and theorized by Wimsatt and Beardsley in their famous essay The Intentional Fallacy ,  was on the right lines ,  but did not go far enough ,  as the author was not really banished .  Some of Easthope 's  approach recalls that of C. S. Lewis in The Personal Heresy  .

The breakdown of English intellectual insularity is welcome in principle ,  but a few things need to be said about this new turn to France .

The use of names rather than <head>arguments</head> as ammunition has become noticeable in such exercises , on both sides of the Atlantic , as Chris Baldick remarks in a review of Frederick Crews 's Skeptical Engagements : One lamentable practice which Crews rightly scorns is the increasingly revived trick or medieval rhetoric in which one attempts to substantiate one 's  theoretical argument not by anything so vulgarly empirical as a fact or a text but merely by invoking a name from the sacred pantheon .

Interestingly ,  Anthony Easthope acknowledges the distinction at one point in Poetry as Discourse  :  Failure to distinguish clearly between signified and referent ,  the object it may refer to ,  has led to serious confusion in some accounts of the ideogram .  Yet it is a confusion he frequently falls into elsewhere ,  as do other New Accents writers .  Tallis 's case is convincing , though he has certainly not said the last word on the matter , and there may well be further <head>arguments</head> from those who are professionally engaged in linguistics . There is interesting supporting material in a book by the American critic Robert Scholes ,  Textual Power  ,  published in 1985 and not consulted by Tallis .  In Tallis 's  reading ,  Saussure did not move from the sign ,  which comprised signifier + signified ,  to reference ,  because he was not interested in doing so ,  being concerned only with the internal aspects of a language - system .

He did not intend to exclude  reality .  The error lies with Saussure 's  expositors .  Scholes , however , believes that Saussure is himself inconsistent , and responsible for later confusion , but the thrust of his <head>argument</head> is very close to Tallis 's , and both of them are concerned as were Thurley and Nuttall to reinstate the validity of reference and to deny that language is a system of pure differences , without relation to reality . Scholes provides a useful table ,  divided into three columns ,  showing how linguists and philosophers have agreed in making a tripartite division between signifier ,  signified ,  and reference ,  though they present it in a variety of terminologies .  For Frege ,  it was Expression ,  Sense ,  Reference  (  Ausdruck ,  Sinn ,  Bedeutung )   .

Some of this writing is acute and interesting ,  the product of lively minds with genuine insights into the state of contemporary culture .  I would often rather read it than more conventional forms of literary scholarship .  Yet it is frequently open to pragmatic self - refutation : it argues against reason by the processes of reason , and a political cause , however radical , cannot be advanced without the traditional processes of <head>argument</head> and attending to evidence . There is admittedly the playfulness of some versions of deconstructionist rhetoric ,  which read like prose - poetry .  But such texts are subject to the limitations of purely aesthetic discourse ,  with no through road to action ,  and must become politically suspect .

Sinfield believed that they were often irredeemably tainted by ideology ,  at best to be read only in historical terms ,  or subject to symptomatic readings ,  seeking the fractures and fissures in the mystified surface of the text that showed the true ideological conditions in which it was produced .  Against this ,  Ryan advanced the humanistic belief that the major canonical texts are not inherently reactionary ,  and that they contain implicit images and models of human freedom which transcend their immediate historical context and which later readers can respond to .  This is an interestingly eclectic <head>argument</head> which recalls Gadamer on the fusion of horizons ( the reader 's and the text 's ) , Marcuse on the utopian possibilities of high culture , and Sartre on the necessarily progressive implications of major literature . Ryan represents a kind of Marxism that non - Marxists might do business with ,  in the sense that one can make a rational engagement with it .  This is not always the case .

It is never very apparent what Freudian claims are based on ,  though they are widely accepted in our culture .  My scepticism has been reinforced by the recent work of Frederick Crews ,  who for many years was a leading psychoanalytic critic in America .  During the 1970s he began to lose faith in the whole Freudian programme , and in his recent book , Skeptical Engagements , he provides detailed and substantially supported <head>arguments</head> for abandoning it . Freud is not ,  however ,  likely to be generally rejected ,  since he is so much part of the valued cultural furniture of the West .  Furthermore ,  attacks such as Crews 's  are ,  as he acknowledges ,  not taken seriously and replied to in their own terms ,  but treated as symptoms of repressed disturbance .

Much of the work that is rediscovered may have the literary qualities that will satisfy readers without particular feminist interests :  the poems by women that Roger Lonsdale included in The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth - Century Verse  are a small - scale ,  easily accessible instance .

This question provoked <head>arguments</head> in America about the Norton Anthology of Literature by Women , some of the contents of which were said to have had little value as literature . A common feminist response is to say that the whole idea of literary standards ,  even standards as such ,  is a form of male domination .

These phrases ,  and others like them ,  have been debated and pondered ,  interpreted and reinterpreted ,  as though they were the formulations of the great philosophers of the past ,  like Plato or Kant ,  rather than the work of a living thinker in mid - career .  There is a sense in which interpretation without conclusion is a mode of play ;  deconstruction insists that philosophical texts must be read as though they were literary texts ,  with full attention to their ambiguities and irresolutions .  In this light , <head>arguments</head> about Derrida 's meaning have the fascination and intractability of arguments about the interpretation of , say , Eliot 's poetry . Indeed ,  it is a central assumption of deconstruction that the distinction between literature and philosophy is exaggerated ,  or arbitrary ,  or even meaningless .

Anyone who can say so clearly just what Derrida is saying ,  or doing ,  immediately puts the reader in his debt .  Yet the clarity and rigour may in themselves be problematical .  This was the position argued some years ago by practitioners of la nouvelle critique , who believed that clarity in <head>argument</head> was a form of ideological mystification , reinforcing the status quo . Put in such extreme terms ,  the position is clearly absurd and self - defeating .  But ,  for Derrida ,  whose fusion  or  ( con )  fusion  of obscurity and playfulness is an essential element in his textuality ,  Norris 's  exposition may represent a process of intellectual tidying up which leaves out something important .

A year or so later I chanced to meet him and he acknowledged that this was just criticism ,  but that he had been obliged to insert these names so that his book would look like a truly up - to - date ,  intouch work of scholarship .

Marxists invoke History as a transcendent signified ,  the ultimate in terms of which everything else is to be explained ;  but there are many histories ,  not one ,  and we choose those which suit us .  As Edward Pechter puts it ,  History does not tell us what the text is ,  because we decide what history is ,  and then put history into the text ,  rather than the other way round .  Something similar is true of politics , another transcendent signified and <head>argument</head> - stopper . Since politics is traditionally one of the major defining activities of a rational humanity ,  the discussion of literature in political terms is not only possible but desirable ,  as the major critics of the past have shown .  But the word politics itself needs to be deconstructed ,  since politics is to do with our ideals of what human life should be ,  about which there has never been agreement ;   indeed ,  it is out of the disagreement that politics arises .

Scholes is not a Marxist ,  but his American cultural populism has affinities with recent Marxist writing ;  at the same time ,  Hirsch and Scholes find themselves in unexpected agreement .  One might reach out to other affinities .  When Scholes writes that no text is so trivial as to be outside the bounds of humanistic study , I am reminded of C. S. Lewis 's <head>argument</head> that any piece of writing has a claim to being literary if someone can read it in a literary i.e. an absorbed , attentive , loving fashion . The effect of all these approaches is to remove literature ,  as conventionally defined ,  canonized ,  institutionalized ,  and taught ,  from the exclusive and isolated position which it has long occupied in the anglophone academy .  Even the modest proposal that literature should be read in its cultural context has large implications .

Literariness is to be found as a basic principle in the work of the Russian Formalists and the New Critics ,  and ,  elaborately formulated ,  in Frye 's  Anatomy of Criticism  .  It inevitably presents itself in formalistic terms ,  and sometimes in overtly aesthetic ones .  The latter presentation is not so common , because of the generally unfavourable associations of aesthetic in our culture , though it is implied whenever students are asked to approach a poem as a work of art , rather than as an historical document or a philosophical <head>argument</head> . Indeed ,  a diluted Croceanism underlies much of our critical and pedagogic discourse ,  with its references to expression ,  feelings ,  intuitions ,  and unique personal responses .  Poems are more plausibly referred to as works of art than novels ;  the latter may have obviously aesthetic qualities ,  but have many other things in them as well .

Something of the sort has already been introduced into some English degrees ,  under the aegis of the Verbal Arts Association ,  who have made a welcome start with such work .  The reading of English poetry would be accompanied by a consideration of historical as well as current theories of poetry .  These would include the <head>arguments</head> of the major poet - critics of the past : Sidney , Jonson , Dryden , Johnson , and on to the Romantics , Victorians , and modernists . I cannot see how the canon of poetry could avoid being constructed along historical lines ,  though the problem and implications of canon - formation should be faced ,  as part of theoretical study .  It could take account of recent attempts to enlarge the canon ,  particularly by the addition of poetry by women ,  and other marginalized groups .

Reviewing and criticism are separate activities ,  but the best literary journalism can provide genuine and valuable criticism ,  as Morris Dickstein has pointed out .  What is needed are more journals that are prepared to publish long ,  serious ,  reflective essays or review - articles ,  as the London Review of Books  does .  Victoria Glendinning , writing as a biographer and literary journalist , has offered some judicious thoughts on the question , which summarize much of my <head>argument</head> : No one could doubt that the application of the academic mind to literature has been salutary in bringing rigour and discipline into criticism :  cleaner texts ,  scholarly annotations ,  precise analysis ,  intelligent  even transforming  interpretations and readings ;  and an intolerance for woolly emotional responses ,  vague inflated recommendations ,  and subjective wallowings of all kinds .  But the academic mind ,  and the exigencies of the academic career ,  have had the effect of splitting off academic approaches to literature from the reading ,  in that word 's  widest sense ,  of ordinary people

Mr Noel Stock ,  who speaks as one who had Pound 's  confidence in recent years and was in daily contact with him ,  explains that this passage derives from a hint thrown out by Jessie L. Weston in her from Ritual to Romance  ,  to the effect that the charges of heresy brought against the Templars were not wholly unfounded ,  since some of the practices of the Eleusinian mystery - cults from the pagan Near East survived in the heart of Christendom in the rituals of the Templars ,  a survival to be traced in literature in the stories and poems about the quest of the holy grail .  From Ritual to Romance  came out in 1920 ,  and was a new book when T.S. Eliot borrowed from it for The Waste Land , thus making it permanently famous ; Pound could not have known of it in 1911 , but if he had then visited the Templars ' cavern - church in Aubeterre he could hardly have failed to remember it in the light of jessie Weston 's <head>argument</head> . Certainly in recent years Pound 's  interest in mystery - cults has been more than antiquarian ;  in was Erigena ours ?  he asks whether the philosopher Scotus Erigena was one of the Eleusinian brotherhood ,  and ours can be given full weight  Noel Stock goes so far as to claim  ( op .  cit .  p.22 )  that some of the obscurity of these later Cantos is deliberate and arcane  he writes about them as an initiate in words that are both published and not published .  Fascinating as this is ,  it is surely with relief that we return from thus checking printed source against printed source ,  cross - referring and tentatively identifying ,  to the open air of the roads of France .

The story is an intricate one ,  as Herbert Schneidau acknowledges ;  and Pound 's  holding out against Ford for the Dantesque principle of a curial diction  ( see his introduction to the poems of Lionel Johnson )  represents to my mind an objection that can still be raised to Ford 's  principles of diction ,  salutary as Ford 's  polemics undoubtedly were for Pound at this time .  Moreover Prothero ,  a historian ,  perhaps had no ideas about poetic diction one way or the other ;  Pound ,  as we have seen ,  thought himself victimized by Prothero not for anything to do with writing but for having championed Lewis the painter and Gaudier the sculptor .  All the same Schneidau 's <head>argument</head> is just and illuminating , so far as it goes . But does it go far enough ?  It is worth looking again at Pound 's  letter to Michael Roberts ,  strident though it is .

If we resent this  ( as we should )  ,  we ought to realize that it is we who are to blame for it .  For neither Kenner nor Pound is a professional or obsessive Anglophobe .  Both men are reporting what seem to them the facts of the case , and they are the more confident about doing so because no Englishman has arisen to rebut their <head>arguments</head> . For us to respond with sneering anti - Americanism is the merest childishness .  After this ,  Pound 's  relations with England and the English were for the most part an aspect of his relations with that one of his erstwhile protgs who had become ,  surprisingly ,  a pillar of the English establishment  Eliot ,  editor of the Criterion  .

All  his pride in his memory ,  his sense of the internationale of writers ,  painters ,  musicians ,  and the aristocrats ,  his study of form as technique  ( no contours ,  no edges ,  intellectual concepts ,  but rounding ,  thrusting ,  as a splash of color ,  as Yeats described his aim in the Cantos )  it is all a huge AESTHETICISM ,  ending in hate for Jews ,  Reds ,  change ,  the content and matter often of disaster ,  a loss of future ,  and in that a fatality as death - full as those for whom the atom bomb is Armageddon ,  not Apocalypse .  Again ,  Pound 's  admirers will protest ;  and they will be right ,  insofar as  Yeats 's  account of the Cantos  is n't so definitive as Olson takes it to be .  But the main thrust of Olson 's <head>argument</head> is unaffected , and it ca n't be set aside : this great American poet ( and Olson knows that Pound is all of that ) was a Fascist , profoundly , and no amount of talk about his affinities with Whitman will save him for democracy , nor will any attempt to treat his anti - Semitism as an unrelated pathological aberration . Another escape hatch that Olson slams shut upon us is the device of distinguishing between Pound - the - man and Pound - the - poet .  The trouble with this manoeuvre is that it cannot help but demote poetry .

An instance ,  and a momentous one ,  is Tate 's  review in Poetry  for November 1932 ,  of Pound 's  How To Read  :  The real criticism of Mr Pound is not to be directed against his theory as such ,  but rather at the hasty headlong fashion  in which he presents it ,  at the logical confusion of his intellect when it is not performing the task which is specifically his own ,  that task being poetry .  The justification of Mr Pound 's thesis in How To Read is not his <head>arguments</head> , but his poetry . Leavis ,  who countered How To Read  with a booklet ,  How to Teach  Reading  ,  and Winters ,  who declared in 1937 ,  Mr Pound resembles a village loafer who sees much and understands little ,  told the same story as Tate :  Pound was a naf  ,  an imagination and sensory apparatus that consistently performed better than it knew ,  in ways that the maker 's  own discursive intelligence failed to comprehend or measure up to ;  in Winters 's  memorable and mordant judgement of 1943 ,  a sensibility without a mind ,  or with as little mind as is well possible .  Take Pound the poet  ( though in strictly limited dosages ,  if you listened to Leavis or Winters )  ,  and ignore Pound the critic  the message was loud and clear ,  and it was attended to .

The choreography likewise evokes changes of weather and mood but without displaying any overt narrative development .  The two central ,  baggy - suited dancers ,  Lynne Bristow and William Trevitt ,  either mirror each others '  movements  ( the old man perhaps communing with his diary )  or else dance as a couple  ( the man reliving past relationships )  .  Thus some slow , desiccated waltzing and gentle leans have the quietude of an old couple on a dull mild day ; sequences of deft , steppy footwork and sharp edged leaps have the high spirits of blustery sunshine , while a duet of rhythmic fidgety gestures has the feel of a lifelong <head>argument</head> continued during a rainy afternoon . The other four dancers regularly interrupt or echo these sequences with images from the past  a robust trio ,  whose folk steps and causally thrown jumps have the coltish energy of adolescence and two couples who look like lovers courting in the 1920s .  By the end this quartet depart the stage in a halting dance of death and Trevitt is rolled up in a carpet ,  leaving Bristow alone without partner or diary .

History shows it can go on for a long time ,  as deficits and surpluses did during the golden age before the First World War .

Evidence of excessive demand There is some observable good sense in this <head>argument</head> , and it helps to explain why sterling has not hit the fan a lot earlier , during a truly spectacular swing from surplus to deficit over the past two years . But its limits are exposed by asking a simple question :  why ,  then ,  should Mr Lawson not be quite happy to see the deficit get even larger ?  Why should a good deficit not get even better ?

Today there is again a global capital market ,  but no gold standard ,  no fixed exchange rates ,  for Britain not even a European Monetary System .  That is not Mr Lawson 's  fault ,  of course ,  but he has to live with the danger that while the world 's  capital markets will duly bridge the gap between Britain 's  domestic savings and investment ,  they will only do so at a lower price for sterling .  If you take the <head>argument</head> about consenting adults to its logical conclusion , that price Britain 's exchange rate should be left to them , too . But however suspicious Mrs Thatcher may be of managed exchange rate systems ,  she dislikes a falling pound as much as anyone .  So we come back around the circle to the capital side of the balance of payments ,  and the operationally interesting question :  for how long can we expect the world 's  savers to make up our domestic shortage ?

Some recent work on green vervet monkeys shows that audience effects can be important in other contexts in which their functional significance is a little easier to identify .  Anne Keddy Hector ,  Robert Seyfarth and Michael Raleigh at the Universities of California and Pennsylvania have been studying parental behaviour among captive vervets to see if males '  parental ability affected the females '  choice of mate .  Their <head>argument</head> was that a male 's potential quality as a parent might be important because , in many species of Old World monkeys , males form strong protective relationships with females and their young , which are crucial in reducing the amount of harassment and competition the young suffer from other members of the group . In a number of species ,  bonds between males and infants within a group may influence the chances of males mating with certain females .  In baboons and Japanese macaques mothers resuming their sexual cycle are more likely to mate with males who have formed a relationship with their offspring .

By the end of this week we shall know what the Labour Party no longer stands for ,  such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and full - scale nationalisation ;  but what ,  in essence ,  does it stand for ?

Some Anglicans would certainly go further :  the Bishop of Birmingham ,  the Right Rev Mark Santer ,  who is the Anglican co - chairman of the theological commission trying to overcome doctrinal differences between the two Churches ,  says :  If Anglicans and other non - Roman Catholics really do believe that the Christian Church is called to be at peace with itself ,  how  given the fact that Christians are sinful  do you actually keep the show together ?  In the end ,  you do have to have some sort of juridical power if you are going to keep the institution together .  This a very English and pragmatic <head>argument</head> for the necessity of a central authority in the Church .

Forest had been comfortable enough for most of the first half .  They went ahead in the 30th minute when Tommy Gaynor skipped away from a couple of tackles and let fly from 25 yards :  no sign of gratitude there for Eoin Hand ,  Huddersfield 's  manager ,  who had helped along his fellow - Irishman 's  career in the early days at Limerick .  Hand 's team , however , replied impressively seven minutes later when Maskell , transfer - listed at his own request after scoring 33 goals last season , scored his first of this , Cecere laying the ball off to the ambitious young man whose crisp drive was a powerful <head>argument</head> for a rise in status . Forest regained the lead four minutes into the second half when Gary Crosby ,  chasing Nigel Clough 's  clever pass ,  swept past Chris Hutchings and poked the ball between Steve Hardwick 's  legs .  It seemed all over in the 63rd minute when Clough ,  a few yards outside the penalty area ,  volleyed a headed clearance instantly into the roof of the net before Hardwick could move a muscle .

The slowdown in military spending and escalating costs of armament programmes will make it increasingly difficult for any company ,  even one the size of BAe ,  to go it alone .

In drawing attention to many such embarrassments ,  Davie 's  book is sure to provoke a good deal of rancour in certain circles .  Yet it would not be quite right to call Under Briggflatts controversial ,  for that deadened word implies a self - serving wish to shock which is far from Davie 's  considered anger .  And if Davie 's principles make him what some might call elitist or undemocratic , as in his stinging verdicts on catchpenny enterprises like the Arvon Poetry Competitions , it is not without his having pondered the <head>arguments</head> about the place and function of elites and of high art in a democratic nation far more deeply than the bulk of his fellow countrymen . Just as importantly ,  he is possessed of a generosity of mind which allows him to be calmly judicious about the merits of writers who can advocate militant homosexuality and drug - taking  ( such as Thom Gunn )  ,  sympathise with feminism  ( Elaine Feinstein )  or adhere to some variant of Marxism  ( Hugh MacDiarmid )  .  Both in his sternness and in his generosity ,  Davie is strongly reminiscent of a much earlier writer ,  whose name is invoked towards the end of Under Briggflatts .

The growth of third parties in the Seventies and early Eighties was in a large part a product of the malfunctioning of the two - party system ,  partly as a consequence of Mrs Thatcher 's  rejection of the post - war consensus but chiefly as a result of Labour 's  leftward lurches .  Mr Kinnock is correct to insist that fundamental changes in the voting system should not be undertaken for short - term ,  tactical reasons .  Nor is there much in the fairness <head>argument</head> , although this is the reason offered by 46 per cent of the people interested in PR . I cannot see that one voting system is intrinsically more fair than another .

His justification for the necessary invasion of privacy is the familiar  -  and thoroughly respectable  plea that politics should and must be personalised .

But this does not stop Abse constructing an elaborate thesis based on Thatcher 's  sphincter morality ,  for which her mother ,  Beatrice ,  should really take the blame :  Thatcher succeeded in initiating the electorate into a new form of gambling :  her personal need to end the earlier constraints which she had endured ,  outlawing the joys of shitting and coprophilia ,  drove her to open the doors of the Stock Exchange ,  and end its exclusivity .  This would seem a benign effect of Thatcher 's  bad potty training ,  except that Abse has a bee in his bonnet against gambling .  The second real objection to this form of psycho - biography is that as soon as Freud is quoted as gospel , the whole <head>argument</head> descends into music hall burlesque for everybody but dedicated Freudians . The aetiology of the urge to gamble lies in joyless masturbation and early ,  still - unresolved bisexuality ,  proclaims Abse ,  after Freud .  Most intelligent people who have not accepted Freudian indoctrination will ask him to tell that to the Marines .

During the debate Roy Hattersley ,  the deputy leader ,  argued that it would be historic folly for Labour to back proportional representation ;  inevitable coalitions would mean that we would never again have a Labour government that was able to carry out a Labour programme .  But advocates of PR said afterwards that the issue would not go away :  Labour has yet to decide its preferred method of electing its proposed regional assemblies and its replacement for the House of Lords .  Jeff Rooker , the MP for Birmingham Perry Barr , who retired from Labour 's front bench last year partly to campaign for PR , said : A lot more people went away from this conference convinced of the merits of the <head>argument</head> than is shown in the vote . Gavin Laird ,  the general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union ,  said that it was the last burning issue Labour needed to resolve before the next election .

The important thing is that the Thirty Year Rule is in force and that we can respond to developing perceptions of our times .  Earlier this year ,  in my capacity as chairman of the Thirties Society ,  I asked Caithness 's  successor ,  Virginia Bottomley ,  to reconsider English Heritage 's  recommendation of Bankside for listing .  My <head>argument</head> was that , as Michael Heseltine had so boldly listed Battersea Power Station in 1980 , it was illogical not to protect a much finer and more complete industrial work by the same architect . Furthermore ,  the listing of Battersea had ensured the building 's  survival for conversion to a new use  in that case ,  as an entertainment centre which the Prime Minister herself had praised and inaugurated .  After two months '  silence ,  I was informed that ministers stood by their decision .

A third effect which could be added is that business experience would be gained by the local merchant ,  and thus the society begins to develop a pool of people with such business experience .  Experience of this nature may reduce the reliance of less developed countries on goods imported from abroad ;  local manufacturers may be able to satisfy local market needs by intelligent marketing ,  and thus gain a larger share of the local market than before ,  with consequent results for local levels of production and the economy generally .  A further element in this <head>argument</head> is the possibility that advertising can be used as part of a marketing strategy to shape the wants and needs of a less developed society in a direction that is clearly beneficial . For instance ,  if a country concerned still employs traditional systems which ,  in the light of more modern techniques ,  appear to be detrimental to public health ,  it may be desirable to change patterns of behaviour in ,  say ,  nutrition or hygiene .  Often this will not be successful if the population is attached to its traditional methods and the new methods are radically different from the old ;  a careful marketing campaign to change attitudes can have a dramatic effect ,  particularly by presenting new products in a way that is not dramatically different from the old .

On balance ,  it was his wish to defend sterling by interventionist methods ,  to check activity at home and keep down the sterling price of imports ,  rather than curb the flow of money ,  that dictated much of his policy .  But what kind of post - monetarism he was espousing was uncertain ,  too .  This uncertainty was reflected in unprecedented levels of <head>argument</head> within the government , conducted in the full glare of public attention . The Prime Minister came close to accusing the Chancellor of starting the inflationary spiral by an attempt to link the rate for sterling with the value of the German deutschmark .  Nigel Lawson rebutted this with some vigour .

The revival of the campaign for Scottish devolution  indeed ,  for Scottish nationalism ,  as shown in Jim Sillars '  by - election victory in Govan  was a notable feature of the later phase of Mrs Thatcher 's  regime .  Here and elsewhere ,  the government strove to identify itself with new themes .  In particular , the green <head>argument</head> advanced by environmentalists , fanned by the importance of themes such as land conservation , acid rain , and the protection of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect in the 1989 Euro - elections , suggested that the message of Thatcherite consumption and wealth creation failed to mesh with wider concerns for the quality of life . The rise of green issues ,  indeed ,  was more naturally appealing to Labour or Alliance politicians ,  and a powerful reminder of the rich variety of resistance to Thatcherism that British society could release .  It led to Nicholas Ridley 's  removal from the Environment department in July 1989 ,  in favour of the notoriously wet Chris Patten .

He relates this to the state of culture of his own age ,  facing dangers of over - specialization ,  which impoverishes both the religious and artistic sensibilities by separating each from the other ,  so that only the vestige of manners  may be left for those who ,  having their sensibility uninformed either by religion or by art ,  have nothing left but an inherited behaviour which ceases to have meaning .  Eliot had written of and against such a milieu  when he combined the elements of the savage and the city ,  from the beating tom - tom of Portrait of a Lady through the rituals of The Waste Land  and Sweeney Agonistes  to the cocktail chatter and jungle martyrdom of the play ,  The Cocktail Party  ,  yet to come .

I have in mind two  especially :  the first involves what might be called the impossibility of desire ,  the second the notion of desire and/or identity as involving an ineluctable splitting .  Like other key notions in psychoanalysis ,  the sense of desire as a quest for an always impossible self - completion in or through the other has a long though oft en unrecognized history .  In this case Kaja Silverman has usefully remarked the importance , for Jacques Lacan 's version of this <head>argument</head> , of Aristophanes ' conception of the person as an original androgynous whole ( in Plato 's Symposium ) . The human subject is conceived in terms of an essential ,  intrinsic lack ;  it is a fragment of something larger and more primordial ,  whose existence is dominated by the desire to recover its missing complement  (  The Subject of Semiotics  ,  152 )  .  But the complement remains forever out of reach and desire thereby becomes ,  for Lacan ,  a kind of derangement ,  with the subject caught in the rails  eternally stretching forth towards the desire for something else   of metonymy  (  &Eacute ; crits  ,  167 )  .

In The Masculine Dilemma   ( 1980 )  ,  subtitled A Psychology of Masculinity ,  Gregory Rochlin offers a different version of the homosexual male ,  but one which is once again in the service of defending an updated heterosexual masculinity ,  and its primacy within a sexual difference metaphysic .  Drawing on psychoanalysis ,  Rochlin rewrites masculinity in a way which makes a virtue of what was hitherto thought of as ,  or experienced as ,  a defect :  its much remarked insecurity .  His <head>argument</head> is as follows : a man 's masculinity is indeed insecure ; it is an endless trial , a precariously held , endlessly tested , unstable condition ( p. 91 ) . In this it is almost tragic :  the unique vulnerability to tailed expectations is the fatal flaw in the masculine ego the testing of masculinity knows no bounds to prove oneself remains a lifelong necessity .

The metaphysical construction of subjectivity is at once an admission and production of its disruptive potential ,  a disruption in and of the very terms of its construction .

Since 1979 the programme of privatization has been defended with a mixture of ideological and pragmatic <head>arguments</head> . One is that such policies produce an extension of economic freedom and ,  thereby ,  political freedom .

The simple division between dry and wet does not ,  however ,  do justice to the currents of opinion in the contemporary Conservative party .  One of the effects of the Thatcher decade has been to redefine the benchmark of divisions .

Whatever the fate of the Thatcher government ,  the New Right will survive it .  In its impact on British politics and economic policy it has already been remarkably successful .  The traditional post - war <head>argument</head> between different kinds of interventionism has been replaced by a much broader debate . The 1983 and 1987 Gallup election surveys showed that voters across all parties agreed on many goals of government .  This is significant ,  given that many commentators in 1983 thought that the policies of the Conservative and Labour parties were further apart than at any time over the previous thirty years .

Instead of being asked ,  as he must have hoped ,  whether he would be willing to form a government ,  he was instead asked whether he would be prepared to serve in a National Government under MacDonald .  This was a question to which ,  for a patriotic Conservative leader ,  there could be only one answer .  The King 's actions in August 1931 are sometimes defended with the <head>argument</head> that he was merely acting on the advice of the party leaders . But the course of these interviews shows that no party leader was unequivocally in favour of a National Government led by MacDonald ,  in the event of the Labour government collapsing .  MacDonald said that he might be of no further use ,   should resign with the whole Cabinet ;  the night before his interview with the King ,  Baldwin had gone to Neville Chamberlain 's  house in Eaton Square ,  and hoped and prayed that he might not have to join a National Government ;  even after his interview with the King .

On 3 October the King told the Prime Minister that he must at all costs find the solution himself ,  and His Majesty would refuse to accept his resignation .  He must be more patient and brace himself up to realise that he was the only person who could tackle the present chaotic state of affairs ,  ' This was the fourth time the King had told MacDonald that he would not accept his resignation .   There were certainly strong <head>arguments</head> in favour of the course which the King adopted . It was clear that the dominant element in his government ,  that is ,  the Conservatives ,  were determined upon an election .  Moreover ,  MacDonald was in principle in favour of an election ,  but unable to secure agreement upon a formula which could reconcile protectionists and free traders up to the very last moment .

He did not do so .  Indeed ,  he put pressure on Sir Herbert Samuel to abandon its terms .  Despite the <head>arguments</head> in favour of the course which the King adopted , his encouragement to MacDonald to hold the government together and to fight the election as a government had quite momentous consequences for the politics of the 1930s . Although the King 's  intentions were not partisan ,  the consequences were such as to offer very considerable benefit to the Conservative party .  The 1931 general election gave the Conservatives a huge overall majority in the House of Commons ,  enabling them to pursue their tariff policy with little hindrance .
