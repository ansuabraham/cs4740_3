He first published a short history at the beginning of the century ,  but the passage quoted comes from the enlarged edition of 1923 .  In discussing Drer ,  he treated him as the most versatile artist of a triumvirate ,  whose other members were Marcantonio Raimondi and Lucas van Leyden .  Of the latter he wrote , Lucas van Leyden is an artist of frailer calibre than Drer , and prone to <head>lose</head> himself in imitation of stronger men , each of his contemporaries in turn dominating his style . Another book about the age of Drer ,  but on a different topic ,  is The Limewood Sculptors of Renaissance Germany  ,  by Michael Baxandall ,  published in 1980 .  The author started his career in the Victoria and Albert Museum ,  where there is an important group of this sculpture ;  his book had a double origin in a museum exhibition and a series of lectures .

The definition of personality which is harboured in such procedures has moved and influenced several generations of writers .

The story that is told is a story which never ends and which risks <head>losing</head> shape and momentum because it is a story told of himself by a living author , an author who has yet to end , whose isolate 's imaginative fury lives on to tell another tale , some more of his own story .

The civil war was not fought over the partition of the island as is popularly believed .  It resulted from one group ,  the republicans ,  not accepting the oath of allegiance to the royal sovereign of the United Kingdom ,  a requirement of the constitution of 1922 .  Though the republicans <head>lost</head> the war , they eventually won their case with their successful introduction of the republican constitution of 1937 . This shows the extent to which the republican ideal gained ground once independence was in place ,  furthering the ideological divide between protestant loyalism and catholic nationalism .  Despite this development ,  the struggle between the two previously warring factions has continued ,  the original republicans developing a populist ,  nationalist party ,  and the former treaty party developing a concern with law and order ,  and moderation on the national question .

He had ordered the opening of the city gates and capitulation .

Once the blockade of the river leading into the city was broken by English ships , James and his besiegers <head>lost</head> heart and abandoned the siege . The mythical value of the siege for the construction of protestant  loyalist hegemony should not be underrated .  In his highly condensed and powerful analysis ,  Buckley  ( 1984 )  details how the siege becomes interpreted by today 's  protestant loyalists according to a key paradigm mediating their experience of the world .

Under the treaty with the United Kingdom ,  the twenty - six counties which were to become the independent state were to remain within the British Empire with dominion status ,  and the British monarch was to remain head of state .  These principles were embodied in the constitution .  The prime reason for bringing in a new constitution in 1937 was the return to dominance of the republican grouping , the side which had <head>lost</head> the civil war , and which had retained the intention of establishing a republic . The new Fianna Fil Party ,  under the leadership of Eamon de Valera ,  was intent on asserting Irish independence to the full by leaving the empire and providing a president to replace the monarchy ,  thus becoming the Republic of Ireland .  The 1922 constitution approved by Britain was considered a model of libertarian democracy .

With a cable break close to the ground there is always plenty of room ahead for the landing .  If it is a slow launch ,  any wind gradient will make the situation even more  critical .  The speed will then be dangerously low by the time that the nose has been lowered , and even more speed will be <head>lost</head> during the descent through the wind gradient . As a pilot becomes more experienced ,  there is a real danger of the control movements becoming programmed .  If this happens he will change the angle of climb automatically as the glider starts to gain height ,  and he will continue to pull it higher for a few seconds even if a power failure has occurred .

It is after they have lost control for the second or third time that the real difficulties appear .

For my contemporaries in the postgraduate school at Durham in the early 1980s ,  the inclusion of the scientism of the self  ( to use Okely 's  phrase )  became part of doing the business  ( to move to the jargon of my contemporaries in the detective departments )  .  The ethnography we pursued and the seminar papers we created all tended to include the subjective I as part of the discourse ,  and we were encouraged to explore the effects of our history ,  our social ,  political ,  sexual ,  and economic influences and include our vision of what we had experienced during the fieldwork situation .

And although always implied rather than broadcast ,  this rejection of intellectualism is so well understood throughout the service that it has even affected those to whom Bramshill scholarships to University have been offered ,  and many turn them down.

The young officer ,  he concluded ,  must escape at the first opportunity or risk being classified as an unambitious no hoper at an early career stage .  A keenly stated desire to move into some area of specialization is a necessity ,  and ,  as a result ,  uniform patrol work becomes synonymous with failure and punishment .

Jones 's  book remained untouched on the shelves of Northumbria 's  modest library in its first two years ,  even though it had good reviews ;  and the influence of his research has been all but negligible .

A less obvious example of this failure to take protective measures occurs when a contestant believes that a scoring technique has been delivered ,  and so  disengages and dances around the area waving a fist in the air .  Since one of the requirements for a score is that the contestant retains an effective defensive posture ,  the potential score is wiped out and a penalty imposed in its place .  Any contestant who , in the referee 's opinion , becomes so over - excited that he <head>loses</head> self control may be disqualified from the entire tournament . You are expected to take adequate steps to protect yourself .  In this example ,  the opponent has thrown himself forwards ,  with no thought of a face guard

Here is Piaget 's  most well - known demonstration of the infant 's  failure to relate actions to experiences .  At about seven months of age the average baby is quite skilled at removing obstacles to prehension ;  is well able ,  for example ,  to pull a cushion away to reach a rattle behind it .  However , if the rattle slips down so far that it is no longer visible , the infant will at once <head>lose</head> interest and behave as if the rattle had also slipped out of existence . By about eight months of age most infants are capable of retrieving completely hidden objects ;  but between eight and twelve months they show another intriguing pattern of errors .  There are now two occluders ,  A and B ,  side - by - side before the infant .

( This does not ,  unlike the Piagetian methods ,  rely on the baby doing anything intentionally  such as reaching .  It allows the psychologist to determine whether the subject has detected a change in a stimulus or can discriminate between two stimuli .  )  Initially the subject will attend to a new stimulus but will then gradually <head>lose</head> interest and start to look away ( habituation ) ; if the stimulus is then changed in some way and if this causes a re - awakening of interest ( dishabituation ) then we can assume that the baby has detected the change . Another technique is preferential looking .  If the subject prefers to look at one stimulus rather than another we can assume that he has detected a difference between them .

Mr Chatrier 's  response would be direct and unashamed .  In his view ,  there are times when you have to fight fire with fire ,  or ,  as he put it rather more eloquently during his defence of the Grand Slam Cup decision ,  It was a sad reality that we were left with no real option but to protect tradition with the modern deterrent  money .  Anyone who believes that Mr Chatrier 's remarks can be dismissed either as those of someone who has <head>lost</head> touch with reality , are also way off the mark . Few have done more over the years to encourage and inspire the growth and development of tennis by putting it on as professional footing as possible .  The rise in the quality of French tennis over the last 20 years ,  culminating in the emergence of players such as Yannick Noah ,  Henri Leconte and now Guy Forget ,  coupled with the transformation of the French Open at Roland Garros into what the majority of players regard as the best organised of the four Grand Slams  ( even though Wimbledon remains favourite as to the one they most want to win )  are due very largely to the leadership he has shown .

Choreographers wish to express themselves through dance because a story ,  theme or music has inspired them .  Their work will require strict adherence by the dancers to a distinctive style of dance and gesture ,  which is designed to communicate thoughts ,  moods ,  emotions and actions as the plot ,  theme or dance unfolds .  They insist that there must be no deviation from that style and demand such loyalty that their dancers <head>lose</head> their own identity and become absorbed in the world of that particular ballet . Fokine was the first choreographer to distinguish the need for a particular style for each ballet when he created such different ballets as Les Sylphides ,  Le Carnaval  ,  Prince Igor ,  The Firebird  and Petrushka  .  From his innovations have come many developments opening the way for similar independently minded choreographers .

This happens in Giselle  where Hilarion 's  suspicions of Albrecht 's  identity are already aroused before Albrecht meets Giselle .  Hilarion 's  discovery of Albrecht 's  sword and later his confrontation with Giselle ,  with the sword in his hands ,  still does not convince Giselle of Albrecht 's  duplicity .  It is only later when Bathilde confronts her with the news that Albrecht is her fianc that Giselle realises the truth and <head>loses</head> her reason . The scenes between Hilarion ,  Giselle ,  Albrecht and Bathilde are reminiscent of the scenes that develop Tybalt 's  hatred of Romeo from the first fight between Montague and Capulet to his discovery of Romeo with Juliet after their first meeting at the ball ,  and finally to the fight that ends in Tybalt 's  death .

The ideal of beauty and normality cannot perish in a healthy society ;  and for this reason you ought to let art go its own way ad be confident that it will not go astray A single ma cannot divine fully the eternal and universal ideal ,  were he Shakespeare himself ,  ad therefore he cannot prescribe either the ways or the aims for art .  The Possessed looked for a long time like <head>losing</head> its way , and Dostoevsky would surely concede that in so far as the design was , to use his own word , tendentious , this was bound to be so . And yet a novel does n't write itself ,  even if some of the very greatest ones appear to ;  it is written by a man with aims and preferences .  But these just happen to be his ,  he ca n't prescribe them for art ;  what he wants to say must come to terms with what the form allows him ;  art refuses to be imposed upon ,  to be dictated to ,  and Dostoevsky 's  dictum will stand .

By the end of this week we shall know what the Labour Party no longer stands for ,  such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and full - scale nationalisation ;  but what ,  in essence ,  does it stand for ?  If it did not exist , would anyone trouble to invent it at a time when , from the Atlantic to the Urals , socialism in all its manifestations is <head>losing</head> the argument to liberal capitalism ? For we should not become too carried away by Labour 's  changed face and tone of voice ,  nor too dazzled by the Peter Mandelson image - conjuring .

Perhaps because to think about reform is to think about its purposes ,  Mr Honecker and his colleagues keep their minds closed to such challenges .

Our existing policies not only remain unchanged after the Peking incident ,  we will move forward in pushing forward the economic reform and open door policy .  But if the anger has faded ,  and Hong Kong companies continue to trade with and manufacture in China ,  Peking 's  crackdown has not been forgotten .  While companies with factories in China show few signs of pulling out in a hurry , some have <head>lost</head> enthusiasm for further expansion . A survey conducted by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce showed that 55 per cent of companies had postponed further investment decisions ,  while another 36 per cent were still debating what to do .  For example ,  Tomei Industrial  ( Holdings )  ,  an electronics company with 95 per cent of its production in China ,  accelerated expansion plans in Malaysia and Thailand ,  and hopes to cut China - based output to about 50 per cent of total production .

He first published a short history at the beginning of the century ,  but the passage quoted comes from the enlarged edition of 1923 .  In discussing Drer ,  he treated him as the most versatile artist of a triumvirate ,  whose other members were Marcantonio Raimondi and Lucas van Leyden .  Of the latter he wrote , Lucas van Leyden is an artist of frailer calibre than Drer , and prone to <head>lose</head> himself in imitation of stronger men , each of his contemporaries in turn dominating his style . Another book about the age of Drer ,  but on a different topic ,  is The Limewood Sculptors of Renaissance Germany  ,  by Michael Baxandall ,  published in 1980 .  The author started his career in the Victoria and Albert Museum ,  where there is an important group of this sculpture ;  his book had a double origin in a museum exhibition and a series of lectures .

The story that is told is a story which never ends and which risks <head>losing</head> shape and momentum because it is a story told of himself by a living author , an author who has yet to end , whose isolate 's imaginative fury lives on to tell another tale , some more of his own story .

The civil war was not fought over the partition of the island as is popularly believed .  It resulted from one group ,  the republicans ,  not accepting the oath of allegiance to the royal sovereign of the United Kingdom ,  a requirement of the constitution of 1922 .  Though the republicans <head>lost</head> the war , they eventually won their case with their successful introduction of the republican constitution of 1937 . This shows the extent to which the republican ideal gained ground once independence was in place ,  furthering the ideological divide between protestant loyalism and catholic nationalism .  Despite this development ,  the struggle between the two previously warring factions has continued ,  the original republicans developing a populist ,  nationalist party ,  and the former treaty party developing a concern with law and order ,  and moderation on the national question .

The mythical value of the siege for the construction of protestant  loyalist hegemony should not be underrated .  In his highly condensed and powerful analysis ,  Buckley  ( 1984 )  details how the siege becomes interpreted by today 's  protestant loyalists according to a key paradigm mediating their experience of the world .

Under the treaty with the United Kingdom ,  the twenty - six counties which were to become the independent state were to remain within the British Empire with dominion status ,  and the British monarch was to remain head of state .  These principles were embodied in the constitution .  The prime reason for bringing in a new constitution in 1937 was the return to dominance of the republican grouping , the side which had <head>lost</head> the civil war , and which had retained the intention of establishing a republic . The new Fianna Fil Party ,  under the leadership of Eamon de Valera ,  was intent on asserting Irish independence to the full by leaving the empire and providing a president to replace the monarchy ,  thus becoming the Republic of Ireland .  The 1922 constitution approved by Britain was considered a model of libertarian democracy .

With a cable break close to the ground there is always plenty of room ahead for the landing .  If it is a slow launch ,  any wind gradient will make the situation even more  critical .  The speed will then be dangerously low by the time that the nose has been lowered , and even more speed will be <head>lost</head> during the descent through the wind gradient . As a pilot becomes more experienced ,  there is a real danger of the control movements becoming programmed .  If this happens he will change the angle of climb automatically as the glider starts to gain height ,  and he will continue to pull it higher for a few seconds even if a power failure has occurred .

It is after they have lost control for the second or third time that the real difficulties appear .

The ethnography we pursued and the seminar papers we created all tended to include the subjective I as part of the discourse ,  and we were encouraged to explore the effects of our history ,  our social ,  political ,  sexual ,  and economic influences and include our vision of what we had experienced during the fieldwork situation .

And although always implied rather than broadcast ,  this rejection of intellectualism is so well understood throughout the service that it has even affected those to whom Bramshill scholarships to University have been offered ,  and many turn them down. I know several inspectors who have refused a college scholarship , arguing that the time spent away from the force was time spent in structural limbo , and it has become almost a common adage that time away is time <head>lost</head> in the promotion stakes . All that is required ,  they feel ,  is the offer of a scholarship from the Police College ,  for it serves the same purpose on the c.v .  and reduces the need to spend time in limbo or the need on re - entry to reestablish oneself .

The young officer ,  he concluded ,  must escape at the first opportunity or risk being classified as an unambitious no hoper at an early career stage .  A keenly stated desire to move into some area of specialization is a necessity ,  and ,  as a result ,  uniform patrol work becomes synonymous with failure and punishment .  Men get sent back from specialist posts to uniform duties as a punishment and the strength of this metaphorical move downwards or backwards ( you can never move up or forwards into uniform ) is not <head>lost</head> on young officers . Few prior to Jones had cared to admit this seditious point except in the columns of the Police Review  ,  where disgruntled beat officers  ( often anonymously )  indicate the paradox of being the revered and reviled base on which all the hierarchy is built .   Jones 's  book remained untouched on the shelves of Northumbria 's  modest library in its first two years ,  even though it had good reviews ;  and the influence of his research has been all but negligible .

A less obvious example of this failure to take protective measures occurs when a contestant believes that a scoring technique has been delivered ,  and so  disengages and dances around the area waving a fist in the air .  Since one of the requirements for a score is that the contestant retains an effective defensive posture ,  the potential score is wiped out and a penalty imposed in its place .  Any contestant who , in the referee 's opinion , becomes so over - excited that he <head>loses</head> self control may be disqualified from the entire tournament . You are expected to take adequate steps to protect yourself .  In this example ,  the opponent has thrown himself forwards ,  with no thought of a face guard

Here is Piaget 's  most well - known demonstration of the infant 's  failure to relate actions to experiences .  At about seven months of age the average baby is quite skilled at removing obstacles to prehension ;  is well able ,  for example ,  to pull a cushion away to reach a rattle behind it .  However , if the rattle slips down so far that it is no longer visible , the infant will at once <head>lose</head> interest and behave as if the rattle had also slipped out of existence . By about eight months of age most infants are capable of retrieving completely hidden objects ;  but between eight and twelve months they show another intriguing pattern of errors .  There are now two occluders ,  A and B ,  side - by - side before the infant .

( This does not ,  unlike the Piagetian methods ,  rely on the baby doing anything intentionally  such as reaching .  It allows the psychologist to determine whether the subject has detected a change in a stimulus or can discriminate between two stimuli .  )  Initially the subject will attend to a new stimulus but will then gradually <head>lose</head> interest and start to look away ( habituation ) ; if the stimulus is then changed in some way and if this causes a re - awakening of interest ( dishabituation ) then we can assume that the baby has detected the change . Another technique is preferential looking .  If the subject prefers to look at one stimulus rather than another we can assume that he has detected a difference between them .

Mr Chatrier 's  response would be direct and unashamed .  In his view ,  there are times when you have to fight fire with fire ,  or ,  as he put it rather more eloquently during his defence of the Grand Slam Cup decision ,  It was a sad reality that we were left with no real option but to protect tradition with the modern deterrent  money .  Anyone who believes that Mr Chatrier 's remarks can be dismissed either as those of someone who has <head>lost</head> touch with reality , are also way off the mark . Few have done more over the years to encourage and inspire the growth and development of tennis by putting it on as professional footing as possible .  The rise in the quality of French tennis over the last 20 years ,  culminating in the emergence of players such as Yannick Noah ,  Henri Leconte and now Guy Forget ,  coupled with the transformation of the French Open at Roland Garros into what the majority of players regard as the best organised of the four Grand Slams  ( even though Wimbledon remains favourite as to the one they most want to win )  are due very largely to the leadership he has shown .

Choreographers wish to express themselves through dance because a story ,  theme or music has inspired them .  Their work will require strict adherence by the dancers to a distinctive style of dance and gesture ,  which is designed to communicate thoughts ,  moods ,  emotions and actions as the plot ,  theme or dance unfolds .  They insist that there must be no deviation from that style and demand such loyalty that their dancers <head>lose</head> their own identity and become absorbed in the world of that particular ballet . Fokine was the first choreographer to distinguish the need for a particular style for each ballet when he created such different ballets as Les Sylphides ,  Le Carnaval  ,  Prince Igor ,  The Firebird  and Petrushka  .  From his innovations have come many developments opening the way for similar independently minded choreographers .

This happens in Giselle  where Hilarion 's  suspicions of Albrecht 's  identity are already aroused before Albrecht meets Giselle .  Hilarion 's  discovery of Albrecht 's  sword and later his confrontation with Giselle ,  with the sword in his hands ,  still does not convince Giselle of Albrecht 's  duplicity .  It is only later when Bathilde confronts her with the news that Albrecht is her fianc that Giselle realises the truth and <head>loses</head> her reason . The scenes between Hilarion ,  Giselle ,  Albrecht and Bathilde are reminiscent of the scenes that develop Tybalt 's  hatred of Romeo from the first fight between Montague and Capulet to his discovery of Romeo with Juliet after their first meeting at the ball ,  and finally to the fight that ends in Tybalt 's  death .  These scenes heighten the tension and suggest that all will end in tragedy .

The ideal of beauty and normality cannot perish in a healthy society ;  and for this reason you ought to let art go its own way ad be confident that it will not go astray A single ma cannot divine fully the eternal and universal ideal ,  were he Shakespeare himself ,  ad therefore he cannot prescribe either the ways or the aims for art .  The Possessed looked for a long time like <head>losing</head> its way , and Dostoevsky would surely concede that in so far as the design was , to use his own word , tendentious , this was bound to be so . And yet a novel does n't write itself ,  even if some of the very greatest ones appear to ;  it is written by a man with aims and preferences .  But these just happen to be his ,  he ca n't prescribe them for art ;  what he wants to say must come to terms with what the form allows him ;  art refuses to be imposed upon ,  to be dictated to ,  and Dostoevsky 's  dictum will stand .

By the end of this week we shall know what the Labour Party no longer stands for ,  such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and full - scale nationalisation ;  but what ,  in essence ,  does it stand for ?  If it did not exist , would anyone trouble to invent it at a time when , from the Atlantic to the Urals , socialism in all its manifestations is <head>losing</head> the argument to liberal capitalism ? For we should not become too carried away by Labour 's  changed face and tone of voice ,  nor too dazzled by the Peter Mandelson image - conjuring .  The party may have put on a collar and tie but it is still the Labour Party ,  prone to its old reflexes  ( as it reminded us yesterday on defence spending )  ,  prisoner still of its anachronistic structure ,  its mind set in 100 years of working -  class history .

Much determination and hard work have gone into that attempt ,  but it is now seen to have failed .  Without reforms ,  failure will become more complete .  Yet if the GDR were to become a multi - party democracy , it would <head>lose</head> its identifying ideology and become a pallid shadow of the Federal Republic : less grossly consumerist , perhaps , but also less desirable . In Bonn it is hoped that there can be orderly change across the border ,  soon enough to convince more East Germans that life is worth living there .  Perhaps because to think about reform is to think about its purposes ,  Mr Honecker and his colleagues keep their minds closed to such challenges .

Our existing policies not only remain unchanged after the Peking incident ,  we will move forward in pushing forward the economic reform and open door policy .  But if the anger has faded ,  and Hong Kong companies continue to trade with and manufacture in China ,  Peking 's  crackdown has not been forgotten .  While companies with factories in China show few signs of pulling out in a hurry , some have <head>lost</head> enthusiasm for further expansion . A survey conducted by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce showed that 55 per cent of companies had postponed further investment decisions ,  while another 36 per cent were still debating what to do .  For example ,  Tomei Industrial  ( Holdings )  ,  an electronics company with 95 per cent of its production in China ,  accelerated expansion plans in Malaysia and Thailand ,  and hopes to cut China - based output to about 50 per cent of total production .
