Ackroyd notices that the Eliot who had once called poetry a mug 's  game was eventually ,  in his play The Elder Statesman  ,  to use the same expression for forgery .  Ackroyd warns us not to jump to a conflation here ,  but he is intrigued by the coincidence ,  and it might almost serve as an emblem of his concern throughout the biography with the connection between poetry and feigning ,  and with the potency of parody .  The biography suggests that Eliot was never to lose the divided sense of his youth that human life is futile and meaningless that man is a finite piece of reasonable misery , in the words of William Drummond of Hawthornden , a good poet who was also a great plagiarist , and a great seeker of <head>shelter</head> in books but that an eternal order might be felt for , or invented . That order was eventually discovered in the teachings of Christianity .  When he turned to God it was to someone other :  he was surrendering to something outside oneself .

It will ,  however ,  occupy more space and ,  depending on the species ,  may take several years to establish .

Dwarf hedges are a traditional means of edging beds ,  especially in herb and kitchen gardens .

Hedges can also provide effective weather protection .

The main wind - break should protect the side of the garden most exposed to prevailing winds ,  with individual or grouped shrubs positioned to limit the impact of other seasonal winds and create sheltered corners for delicate plants .

The splendid open aspect in all directions probably accounts for the building of Britain 's  highest Iron Age hill fort whose ramparts encircled the plateau .  Outlines of hut circles ,  still visible ,  suggest there was a permanent Brigante settlement here ,  supposedly one of the last strongholds against the Romans .  The summit itself is crowned by a trig pillar , a huge cairn , and a walled <head>shelter</head> along with the remains of a celebratory tower built in 1838 to commemorate Victoria 's Coronation , but wrecked by revelling locals after the opening there were problems with vandals even in those days ! Ingleborough 's  steep sides always manage to give the impression that the top of the hill has been sliced off ;  when it 's  cloaked in a mist cap ,  you can almost imagine a cone - shaped summit .  Maybe it was wishful thinking that made Thomas Jeffrey show the hill on his 18th Century map with a height of 5,280 feet  the second highest mountain in Britain ,  its neighbour Whernside supposedly being highest .

It was truly a hegemony that extended the market ethic beneath the <head>shelter</head> of an increasingly powerful state apparatus , at the cost of both social cohesion and personal liberty . It penetrated the very substructure of national culture ,  with the message of traditional capitalism proclaimed in an unusually explicit and aggressive form .

The machine could either stand on the threshing floor of an orthodox flail - threshing barn , which provided <head>shelter</head> from the weather , or it could be taken to the ricks in the fields . The first practice probably encouraged the retention of many old and large flail - threshing barns which might otherwise have fallen into disuse ,  inviting demolition .

The quickly erected boarded external finish of the former storage shed and the predominantly dry construction of the internal wall linings made this a practical policy once reconstruction ,  during the spring and summer months ,  of the decayed lower - storey brickwork was complete and had produced a habitable shell .  The complete interior of the house could not be occupied until the final months of 1985 and the owners stayed for only one further year before the challenge of converting a local barn tempted them away !

He is right ,  though his play does not leave his audiences with much of a zest for battle .   Via dolorosa ONLY a handful of artists have been sufficiently disturbed by the violence of war to capture it in their paintings : Goya certainly , Henry Moore in his air - raid <head>shelter</head> sketches , Picasso in his Guernica perhaps , and , a step down , Paul Nash and Wyndham Lewis . For the remainder ,  most of the pictures culled by M.R.D .  Foot from the vast treasure trove of the Imperial War Museum in a handsome selection ,  ART AND WAR* ,  are no more than intelligent ,  technically competent commentaries on particular aspects of war in this century .  A few ,  largely born of the experience of the first world war ,  transcend illustration and illuminate ,  like flares ,  the nature of war in all its brutality .

The most striking Iraqi achievement so far has been the saving of its air force ,  a feat that owes more to engineering than combat .  According to the Americans ,  a handful of dogfights during the first week produced a lopsided result :  nearly a score of the most modern Iraqi French -  and Soviet - built fighters shot down in the air for the loss ,  possibly ,  of a single American fighter .  Most of Iraq 's 800 or so aircraft have spent the war on or under the ground in well - protected <head>shelters</head> and hiding places . The Americans put the first - week total of Iraqi aircraft destroyed ,  on both air and ground ,  at 41 ;  the British estimate is gloomier .  Allied spokesmen make light of the fact that so many enemy aircraft remain intact .

Though this was a less controversial aim it had less emotional kick .

He had never understood the old joke .  But Sandra was thinking of sheep .  A picture came to her of the shaggy wanderers huddling together in the bus <head>shelter</head> at the top of the road where she had been born and bred . It 's  a cold old night for the animals ,  she said ,  exactly duplicating one of her step - father 's  regular phrases .  The other three looked at her as though she had spoken in an old and now unknown language .

The simplest and safest response was to agree with him ,  and then find a way of doing what you wanted later .  That was why she had two bank accounts and an occasional bruise on her face .  Across the emptying room another hurt mind had been at the same moment of time glanced by unwanted evocations of shabby Forest sheep nudging together in a brick <head>shelter</head> on a high road through the trees . Looking at each other ,  wordlessly grappling ,  two people from the same small segment of the country had unknowingly provoked in each other ill - formed shapes of what used to be home ,  and as yet unrecognized images of what used to be themselves .  The slow dance was quickening ,  swirling them back and back through the darkening woods and stabbing gorse of memory to the sheep trying to escape the cold night and ,  beyond that ,  to the ways in which each of them ,  Forest girl and Forest boy ,  had first joined body with another .

Far away across the varied greens and browns the wood - jagged horizon gave way to the faint blue hump of the Malvern Hills .  In the opposite direction ,  firmer in outline ,  more clearly separated from the cling of the sky ,  the darker mountains of Wales set the boundary of his vision .  Sitting safe in the big tree , hidden within the protective myriad of bough , branch and leaf , he was submerged in a greenish half - light filtered through layer upon layer of natural growth , and he was looking out from the dimming or dappling <head>shelter</head> of his high cave into the dazzle of a rare summer brightness beyond . The boy was not then aware ,  of course ,  of how frequently an idling or unanchored mind can be disturbed by the accidental experience of receiving luminous images from out of clear ,  sharp light when it is itself cast in any sort of shadow .  It is physiologically unsettling to gaze out from a dark patch into a brighter one .

Among the Great and Good ,  scarcely a voice could be heard supporting a proposal which the BBC 's  founding father ,  Lord Reith ,  had said would prove as beneficial as dog - racing ,  smallpox or the bubonic plague .  The Tory party leadership ,  including Churchill  ( who thought commercial television a tuppenny Punch and Judy show )  ,  Lord Salisbury ,  Sir Anthony Eden and R. A. Butler ,  were unenthusiastic .  The leaders of the Trades Union Congress , governors of the BBC , the Archbishops of York and Canterbury , to say nothing of grand figures like the former foreign secretary , Lord Halifax , the former chancellor and home secretary who gave his name to the wartime Anderson <head>shelter</head> , Lord Waverley , and the sainted Lady Violet Bonham Carter were all against .

Learning the needs of horses is the first step in discovering their emotions ,  and understanding their behaviour .  Horses ,  like people ,  have a number of essential needs ,  both physical and psychological .  Their physical needs are for food , water , <head>shelter</head> from extreme weather , a safe environment , sensory stimulation , light , exercise , and freedom from injury , pain , or parasites . Essential psychological needs are for companionship of other horses ,  affection ,  self - esteem ,  respect and acceptance by the herd ,  mental stimulation ,  and sufficient space .  Domesticated horses ,  again like ,  people ,  can be conditioned to have other needs too ,  and can learn to like or want something which would be of no interest to a wild horse .

In hilly country ,  horses always like to spend some of each day on the tops of the hills :  they need to satisfy their desire for the space and freedom that a hilltop provides .  So ,  if they are paddocked lower on a hillside ,  they frequently wear a track with restless pacing along the highest fence  rather than along any other. For this reason , if <head>shelter</head> sheds are placed in a paddock , they may have to be placed at the top of the hill and preferably near the gate . Horses tend not to use badly sited shelter sheds ,  no matter how hot or cold it is .  When horses are put together in paddocks ,  they need to be carefully chosen for their mutual compatibility .

In a small group there is less stress to the horses ,  especially those lower in the hierarchy ,  and it is also safer and more pleasant for the people handling and feeding them .  Obviously stallions and colts over ten months old need special arrangements ,  and brood mares and foals should have a paddock of their own ;  but sometimes other horses can be very aggressive .  Occasionally a gelding , or even a mare , may be so aggressive that there is a real possibility of it seriously injuring another horse , especially if there are <head>shelter</head> sheds another horse can be trapped in , although for some horses even the corner of the paddock is enough . As we have already mentioned ,  for this reason ,  shelter sheds and troughs are never placed in the very corners of paddocks or yards .

However ,  the horse in captivity usually cannot help itself in anxiety provoking situations :  it is dependent upon people for its reduction in anxiety ;  it relies upon people for its needs .  If the need is not satisfied it can have the most injurious results .  The need for food , water , and <head>shelter</head> is clear , but the horse 's other needs are less obvious . Horses need to be able to see different things happening around them ,  hear different sounds ,  and smell different smells ,  and so on :  they need variety and stimulation .  Lack of mental or sensory stimulation ,  in reality enforced boredom ,  is frequently imposed upon Thoroughbred race - horses ,  showhorses ,  and stallions ,  with devastating results .

Distressed by the cold it eventually leaves its mother 's  side and finds the warmth and comfort of the dry stable .

Probably these seemingly unintelligent mares were unable to find <head>shelter</head> in such weather when they were young , and now as older horses they put up with such conditions out of habit a habit that is not conducive to the best health of the horse .

Although they will gallop around trying to get rid of the bot - fly ,  they seem to quickly discover that the bot will not follow them into the dense shade of a shelter shed or stable .  Foals who have learnt to evade bot - flies in such a way ,  will continue to do so as adult horses if they have access to shelter. Older horses who do n't try and run away from bot - flies , usually have not had the use of <head>shelter</head> sheds when they were young , so have formed the habit of no longer attempting to evade these injurious insects . As we have seen ,  the establishment of a habit can create a situation where a horse refuses to think  irrespective of how intelligent a horse may be ,  and even if solving the problem is in the horse 's  own interests .  This became even more apparent to us when we tried to devise an intelligence test for horses .

Joseph rode away at the head of his people , seeking <head>shelter</head> from the winter snows , recalling of his father : I buried him in that beautiful valley of winding waters .  I love that land more than all the rest of the world .

A royal wedding took place on 26th .  April 1923 ,  which had greater significance than was realised then  the Duke of York married lady Elizabeth Bowes - Lyon ,  who later became King George VI and Queen Elizabeth  now the Queen Mother .  Also in 1923 , the Urban District Council of Chiswick purchased from the Duke of Devonshire , one hundred and thirty acres of riverside meadowland , for public use and it was adapted with embankment , tree lined promenade , <head>shelters</head> and a bandstand . These Dukes Meadows are particularly recalled on the occasion of the annual University Boat Race .  Because reparations had not been received from Germany ,  French and Belgian troops re - occupied the Ruhr area of Germany in January 1923 .

No such assurance was received ,  but the German troops advanced very rapidly ,  cawing some concern to Russia ,  so Stalin decided that he would prefer the German troops to stop halfway across Poland and he sent his  troops into that poor country from the east .  In addition ;  Stalin realised that Russia was vulnerable from attack through Finland ,  so between the end of November 1939 and the spring of 1940 ,  Russian troops fought the Finish and achieved control of the Baltic States .  Back in Britain , men were called to arms ; everyone was issued with a gas mask ; sandbags were provided to protect specified buildings and to provide some <head>shelter</head> against the expected air attacks , and provision of Air Raid Shelters was hastened . Concern for the safety of young children resulted in a massive scheme to evacuate children from the vulnerable cities to safe homes in more isolated country areas .  Those endeavours were proved to be somewhat premature as no real bombing of cities occurred until the following year ,  and many of the  children had returned home only to have to be again evacuated when the bombing did start .

Often these people believed that each of the components of nature  the forest ,  the rivers ,  the sky  was occupied and guarded by a jealous god ,  and they behaved as if that were the case .  Other societies , at other times , have simply regarded the elements of nature as commodities : sources of food , fuel , <head>shelter</head> , transport , and wealth .

Others  anemones ,  winkles ,  starfish  are affixed in or move into sheltered places ,  under rocks ,  and remain cool and reasonably moist and protected from pounding .  Seaweeds such as the brown kelp produce mucus - like materials to hold moisture , and in any case can survive desiccation ; and many animals , including shore crabs , <head>shelter</head> among their damp fronds . So the shore - line creatures adopt several different strategies for survival ;  and animals from very different phyla  notably coelenterates ,  molluscs ,  crustaceans ,  and echinoderms  have found  ( various )  ways of coping with the intertidal zones .  And although the number of species  in the intertidal zone is not necessarily enormous ,  individuals of those specialists that have evolved to cope are often present in very large numbers .

Mangroves are trees that grow right at the edge of the sea ,  held and nourished through characteristic prop roots that grip the soft mud .  They are not a specific kind of tree ,  but a way of being a tree ;  several unrelated species  ( black mangroves ,  white mangroves ,  etc )  are involved .  In Florida , the Caribbean , Queensland , and South East Asia they may be extremely extensive , and are important not only for the huge variety of life within them crabs , spiders , molluscs but also for the many creatures that visit them for food ( herons , egrets ) and which breed in the <head>shelter</head> they provide . In particular ,  mangroves are the nurseries for huge numbers of tropical fish ,  which as adults live in the open sea .  If mangroves are destroyed  ( as they often are ,  to create beaches and hotels  as in Miami )  then marine ecosystems a thousand miles away may suffer .

The rapidly increasing urban population has placed an impossible strain on the provision of housing .

Since the standard housing of towns and cities has been unable to provide <head>shelter</head> , urban populations have been compelled to take the situation into their own hands and put up their own homes .

The Peruvian military reacted with force during the Pamplona invasion in May 1971 ,  when they tried to evict the tens of thousands who had participated in this huge squatter invasion in Lima ,  with the result that there were several injuries and one death  ( Collier 1975 )  .  Other governments have viewed the spontaneous housing settlements as wretched areas ,  which not only house society 's  drop - outs ,  but are also breeding grounds for crime and radical political activity The Brazilian government has tried to eradicate the squatter settlements for these reasons ,  which is especially the case in Rio de Janeiro ,  because of the added factor that it is an international tourist centre and the favelas  are so visible on the steep hillsides behind the luxury hotels and beaches .  Some of the favelas have been knocked down , but there still remains the problem of <head>shelter</head> for their inhabitants . As a result ,  when shacks disappear ,  others appear in other parts of the city .  The government has attempted some favela  removal programs ,  but these have not been very successful ,  mainly because  the new housing schemes are too expensive .

For many ,  the movement is one of  horizontal mobility rather than vertical .  Some of the discussion of the informal sector and the Turner thesis suggest that ,  for a minority ,  there may be small improvements in housing or occupation ,  but the majority remain part of the mass of the urban poor .

There were new sources of inspiration .  Where the palace ,  the temple ,  and the cathedral had inspired their Victorian predecessors ,  British station - builders of the inter - war years chose more democratic models  the cinema  ( Surbiton )  ,  the bank  ( Exmouth )  ,  and ,  with unintended irony ,  the garage  ( West Monkseaton )  .  They in their turn were to give way after tunenlightenedhe Second World War to the models of the bus - <head>shelter</head> , the airport , and the office - block , the ultimate in bankruptcy of imagination . The railway industry had a propaganda purpose in the streamlining of outlines and in the new doctrine of modernism in these years .  Streamlining implied speed and ,  in increasingly acute competition with road transport ,  the railways '  commitment to superior speed needed to be stressed constantly .

But their spirit had entirely vanished by the Second World War .  New large city stations were built at Toledo  ( 1950 )  and New Orleans  ( 1954 )  ,  but in a totally undistinguished style .  Otherwise bus <head>shelters</head> were provided when small stations were knocked or burned down. Just such a brave new station was the romantically named Route 128 at Boston .  By the time that the Educational Facilities Laboratories and the National Endowment for the Arts were producing their two excellent booklets on the reuse of railroad stations in 1974 and 1975 ,  only one per cent of all inter - city travel was by train .

It retained many of the traditional features of stations ,  including a clock - tower more than 100 ft. high ,  and large circulation areas adorned with tiles with Maori motifs ,  and frescos depicting New Zealand scenes .  This inaugurated a new wave of station - building .  At a time when new stations elsewhere meant bus <head>shelters</head> , fine new stations which retained at least some of the spirit of the old were provided at Taita , Palmerston North , and Rotorua , among others . Nevertheless ,  small rural stations have been closing throughout New Zealand ,  often to the accompaniment of vigorous opposition from New Zealand farmers .  Despite their rearguard action ,  however ,  freight handling has been concentrated at larger stations ,  destroying the role of the small station in the community .

Dogs in general ,  Rottweilers in particular ,  are loyal and reliable ;  dare I say ,  much more reliable than human beings !  We have taken from the Rottweiler ,  companionship and help in many fields :  hunting ,  protecting our homes and family ,  pulling carts ,  acting as guide dogs for the blind ,  search and rescue ,  herding cattle and so on .  In return , we give our companion <head>shelter</head> and food . It is an unwritten agreement and if we renege on it ,  let us not be surprised if our dog loses his respect for us ,  for we are not worthy of being called Master .  In modern times ,  the demands we make have changed in some ways .

Coconut palms bow towards the sea , banana trees afford <head>shelter</head> at bus stops and vividly coloured croton hedges separate the patch of one clapboard chattel house from the next .

Look carefully at the pavement as there are many details that tell a story .  Coal hole covers were made in different patterns and embossed with the name of the foundry ;  outside older houses ,  the bootscrapers can often still be seen .  Many categories of street furniture can now be listed pillar boxes , telephone kiosks , drinking fountains and bus <head>shelters</head> . Though the traditional pillar boxes  oval ,  round or octagonal  appear at the moment safe ,  the wall - mounted variety are under threat .  Due to public outcry ,  well over 1,000  ( out of perhaps 50,000 )  red telephone boxes have been listed ,  but this of course is only a tiny fraction .

A red telephone box on a village green is part of the country scene ,  as quintessential in its way as the village pond or pub .  A red telephone box in such circumstances may not be special in itself ,  but special to the area .  Great care was taken in the early years of this century to design bus <head>shelters</head> that were in keeping with country villages . They are not only worth preserving in themselves ;  a watchful eye needs to be kept to ensure that some other piece of street furniture  say one of the new all - glass telephone boxes  is not crudely juxtaposed beside them .  An active local society needs to be in constant contact with not only the local authority but all the public utilities .

This change of emphasis from cash to produce is probably the most difficult mental hurdle .  Immediate cash profit has far too long been the overriding aim :  it has warped the genuine economy and forced farmers to consider every move in the context of How soon will it pay ?  Cash profits are necessary ; but the nearer a community can come to providing its own basic requirements of food , <head>shelter</head> , and energy , the less cash is needed for the luxuries . Within the pattern of large - scale commercial farming ,  the independent smallholder can still provide more than his share of surplus food for the urban population ,  yet keep as top priority the conservation of his main capital  the soil .  The acceptance of discipline is probably the greatest step towards freedom a man can take ,  and nowhere is this so true as in smallholding .

You should therefore devise a clear plan with priorities ,  and introduce your livestock bit by bit as your fencing permits .  By far the strongest and most permanent field divisions are stone walls .  Once built they will last forever , the materials for repairs are always on site , and they provide <head>shelter</head> from wind and weather . Few can afford the time and cost of building a new stone wall today ,  but the principles of dry stone walling ,  clearly outlined in Rainsford - Hannay 's  book Dry Stone Walling  ,  are straightforward and you can easily acquire enough skill to do effective repairs .  Well - laid hedges of thorn ,  hazel ,  holly ,  or beech  ( or more generally a mixture of several species )  form very effective barriers ,  and provide shelter for livestock and a habitat for wild life .

If this could be proved beyond doubt  ,  direct drilling would fit in well with the organic philosophy .  The drills are too expensive for a smallholding ,  and even in the hands of a contractor ,  the technique  ( including spraying )  is not cheaper than conventional tillage .  Perennial weeds such as couch or coltsfoot are more difficult to control , and slugs , which <head>shelter</head> and multiply in the deep , hard - sided slits , can become a serious pest . Winter cereals are slow to establish ,  and must be sown earlier :  this is apparently because there is a tendency for stubble or killed turf to be pushed down into the slits with the seed where it can create anaerobic conditions leading to the formation of toxic substances such as acetic acid .  But one might be forgiven for doubting if this is the most likely cause of the toxic side - effects of direct drilling !

It leads only to the Charles Inglis Clark mountain hut ,  a prestigious private hut owned by the Scottish Mountaineering Club and hence frequented by respectable rock - climbing doctors ,  lawyers and accountants .  The hut is in a most peculiar situation ,  perched perfectly as the map would imply ,  to receive the maximum effect of the avalanche loading slopes behind it .

Hardly the case here .

Most of the woodland is located on hill farms and unrestricted access by sheep is encouraged to provide winter <head>shelter</head> and year - round grazing . 85 %  of the woodland area is dominated by mature trees ,  indicating that grazing has been heavy enough for a long time to Prevent sapling recruitment .

BUS SHELTER PLAN ROPLEY residents could soon benefit from a new bus <head>shelter</head> on the A31 at Darvill Road . Following a request at the annual parish meeting ,  councillors have agreed to look into the cost of providing a shelter to be sited on an existing area of hard standing .  Another matter raised by the public highlighted the problem of double parking outside the coffee room by the church .

Talbot Square now became a focal point on the tramway system ,  where the new town routes met the busy Promenade track ,  newly relaid and extended to the Gynn .  In 1902 ,  a direct line was laid up Clifton Street for the Marton cars to avoid the bottleneck on Talbot Road .  The two tram routes departed from opposite sides of the central loading island in the Square , where for many years there was an ornamental drinking fountain and later a stone <head>shelter</head> and underground toilets . In 1911 the Circular Tour was introduced to boost the finances of the Marton route ,  and toastrack cars became a regular sight in the Square ,  loading at the island before crossing the Promenade ,  and returning along Abingdon Street .  The imposing dome of the Winter Gardens dominated the street ,  and the track in the foreground became a siding for theatre   specials .

With its incredible wealth  about 6 million estimated annual income has been suggested  and ownership of about nine thousand manors came inevitable corruption as the Templars took advantage of the privileges granted to them by the Pope .  At last ,  early in the 14th century ,  the Pope dissolved the order at the behest of King Philippe of France .  Much of their property , including that at Temple Moor , was given to the Knights Hospitallers , who continued to provide <head>shelter</head> for travellers across that barren land . Why did Philippe demand that the Pope dissolve the order ?  The generally accepted reason was that the French coffers were nearly empty and he wanted to replenish them from the vast treasures of the Knights Templars .

During the Second World War ,  when cattle food supplies were necessarily restricted so that the supposedly early maturing breeds were deprived of some of their rations ,  it was the Devon and the related Sussex which came to the fore and proved that ,  even under difficult conditions ,  they were able to produce good beef quickly .  They managed to finish on grass quite happily and their marbled ,  lean ,  tender beef caught the eye of the butchers ,  as it has for centuries .  In the 1960s the breed was exported to Canada and is thriving at altitudes of 1,400m on the eastern slopes of the Rockies with bitter winter temperatures and no more <head>shelter</head> than brush . They also thrive in Kenya on a farm at 1,800m above sea level ,  in a wet savannah climate where they are being used to improve native cattle .  There are breed societies in the UK  ( 1884 ;  herdbook 1851 )  ,  Australia ,  Brazil ,  New Zealand ,  South Africa and the USA .

The cottage is essentially of the seventeenth century ,  but was restored in 1800 and greatly enlarged during the second half of the nineteenth century That ,  needless to say ,  was at best half the story ,  since Tom Poole 's  house had immediately become for Coleridge a spacious and comfortable refuge whenever Lime Street grew oppressive .  A gate set up by Tom Poole at the bottom of the Lime Street orchard led directly into his own garden , a small secluded area which lay at some distance behind Poole 's house in Castle Street and which contained , beneath the <head>shelter</head> of a lime - tree , a jasmine - covered arbour . ( A modern bungalow now occupies the site .  )  From this garden Coleridge could either walk on through Poole 's  orchard and a fine meadow to the home of his new friends ,  John and Anna Cruikshank ,  or he could negotiate Poole 's  tanyard and its Tartarean tan - pits to reach the Castle Street house itself .

It was also in the closing weeks of the year that long explorations of the Somerset landscape by Coleridge and the Wordsworths began to have far reaching creative consequences .  During one excursion which probably occurred at this time Tom Poole took his friends to Walford 's  Gibbet on the Quantock slopes between Holford and Stowey ,  and there recounted John Walford 's  tragic history .  Walford , a charcoal - burner who had spent his solitary life in a woodland <head>shelter</head> built of poles and turf , was remembered by Tom Poole as a man remarkable for good temper and generosity , but one who also possessed ardent feelings and strong passions . He was deeply in love with an Over Stowey woman called Ann Rice ,  but was forced into marriage to a half - mad girl who had visited him at his shelter and who bore him two illegitimate children .  They married in June 1789 ,  and a month later ,  in despair and rage ,  he murdered her as they walked in the darkness to the Castle of Comfort Inn .

Apart from the increased pressures on fuelwood ,  rubbish disposal is disfiguring the landscape ,  especially along the trail from Lukla ,  through Namche Bazar ,  to the Everest Base Camp .  Climbing expeditions into the peaks themselves have also left behind piles of rubbish ,  and Cullen  ( 1986 )  points out that the problem is compounded by the fact that in such a high Alpine environment decomposition rates are very slow so that discarded materials may persist for several years if not decades .  Moreover , expeditions tend to congregate in a few favoured areas which provide rapid access to peaks as well as adequate water supplies and <head>shelter</head> from natural hazards like avalanches . Add to this the rapid growth in the numbers of expeditions ,  climbers and trekkers which has occurred in recent years and it is not surprising that the problem has reached massive proportions despite the availability of new access sites from Tibet which was opened to climbers in 1980 .  Obviously ,  the harsh terrain and the inhospitable weather conditions mean that rubbish disposal is a subordinate concern ,  in relation to climbing goals and survival ,  of climbers in the mountain peaks ,  the major problem areas are the base camps .

On landing I sought for the cottage occupied by the Duke of Hamilton 's  piper ,  in which some friends had found most comfortable quarters the season before .

None the less ,  Springhall is unwilling to conclude that young people were repressed by adults .

On this basis he maintains that these adults should not be seen as agents of social control repressing the young  as reductionist social history might suggest  but as agents of socialization preparing them for their future roles as citizens in a society to which most adolescents gave unthinking and willing allegiance .  No one disputes that agents of socialization were hard at work on working - class adolescents .

Ackroyd notices that the Eliot who had once called poetry a mug 's  game was eventually ,  in his play The Elder Statesman  ,  to use the same expression for forgery .  Ackroyd warns us not to jump to a conflation here ,  but he is intrigued by the coincidence ,  and it might almost serve as an emblem of his concern throughout the biography with the connection between poetry and feigning ,  and with the potency of parody .  The biography suggests that Eliot was never to lose the divided sense of his youth that human life is futile and meaningless that man is a finite piece of reasonable misery , in the words of William Drummond of Hawthornden , a good poet who was also a great plagiarist , and a great seeker of <head>shelter</head> in books but that an eternal order might be felt for , or invented . That order was eventually discovered in the teachings of Christianity .  When he turned to God it was to someone other :  he was surrendering to something outside oneself .

It will ,  however ,  occupy more space and ,  depending on the species ,  may take several years to establish .

Dwarf hedges are a traditional means of edging beds ,  especially in herb and kitchen gardens .

The main wind - break should protect the side of the garden most exposed to prevailing winds ,  with individual or grouped shrubs positioned to limit the impact of other seasonal winds and create sheltered corners for delicate plants .

The splendid open aspect in all directions probably accounts for the building of Britain 's  highest Iron Age hill fort whose ramparts encircled the plateau .  Outlines of hut circles ,  still visible ,  suggest there was a permanent Brigante settlement here ,  supposedly one of the last strongholds against the Romans .  The summit itself is crowned by a trig pillar , a huge cairn , and a walled <head>shelter</head> along with the remains of a celebratory tower built in 1838 to commemorate Victoria 's Coronation , but wrecked by revelling locals after the opening there were problems with vandals even in those days ! Ingleborough 's  steep sides always manage to give the impression that the top of the hill has been sliced off ;  when it 's  cloaked in a mist cap ,  you can almost imagine a cone - shaped summit .  Maybe it was wishful thinking that made Thomas Jeffrey show the hill on his 18th Century map with a height of 5,280 feet  the second highest mountain in Britain ,  its neighbour Whernside supposedly being highest .

On January 21st ,  however ,  the Iraqis said they were placing prisoners of war near scientific and economic targets ,  liable to air attack .  That is explicitly contrary to Article 23 of the third convention ,  whereby the presence of a prisoner may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations .  He is to be afforded <head>shelter</head> from bombardment to the same extent as the local civilian population . President George Bush announced immediately that using prisoners as shields was a war crime ,  for which Saddam Hussein would be held accountable .  America 's  war aims may now be expanded to include Mr Hussein 's  capture and trial .

In Claude Berri 's  latest film ,  Uranus ,  he knocks back a whole bottle of wine without pausing for breath ;  although he insists that it was merely coloured water ,  his fans believe otherwise .

He sought <head>shelter</head> at night with prostitutes , and earned money in various unlawful ways . When his home town made him an honoured citizen some years ago ,  he reminded friends that they used to fling me in jail .  He has dismissed as dirtying ,  disgusting and unfair charges in Time and the Washington Post that he took part in a gang rape at the age of nine .

Peter Monroe ,  president of the RTC 's  supervisory board ,  said in a recent interview that he has got a pretty clear message from Congress that he is not running a social service .

The rules do permit the RTC to give away worthless properties to housing groups to use as <head>shelters</head> for the homeless . A few have been turned over to groups in Arkansas ,  Florida and Texas .  By the time the agency finishes its massive job ,  it could have a lot more worthless property on its hands .

Now he recalled how ,  on the second night after his mother had left home ,  he had climbed out of bed in the late evening and slipped unnoticed from the house to run over a mile to Bournemouth Central Railway Station to catch a train to nearby  Christchurch ,  where his mother had gone to live with her sister .  It was a cold night in late autumn and the rain had lashed down unremittingly .  By the time he had reached the <head>shelter</head> of the station he was soaked to the skin . He had paid three pence at the booking office for his ticket and ,  after waiting ten minutes or so on the cold and draughty platform for the next London - bound train ,  he had arrived at Christchurch some ten minutes later to run through torrential rain toward the group of cottages which flanked the open park in the town centre .  He was not certain which cottage his aunt rented during the winter .

While CND concentrated on the aim of British nuclear disarmament ,  the American Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy  Sane for short  campaigned for general disarmament .  Though this was a less controversial aim it had less emotional kick .  Launched in 1957 , it claimed 25,000 supporters by 1958 and by 1960 pacifist members had sailed into the Pacific testing grounds , boarded nuclear submarines or missile bases or simply refused to take <head>shelter</head> during bomb drills . But during the Fifties the impact of the Disarmers on American public opinion was very marginal according to David Riesman ,  the Harvard sage .

Across the emptying room another hurt mind had been at the same moment of time glanced by unwanted evocations of shabby Forest sheep nudging together in a brick <head>shelter</head> on a high road through the trees . Looking at each other ,  wordlessly grappling ,  two people from the same small segment of the country had unknowingly provoked in each other ill - formed shapes of what used to be home ,  and as yet unrecognized images of what used to be themselves .  The slow dance was quickening ,  swirling them back and back through the darkening woods and stabbing gorse of memory to the sheep trying to escape the cold night and ,  beyond that ,  to the ways in which each of them ,  Forest girl and Forest boy ,  had first joined body with another .

Learning the needs of horses is the first step in discovering their emotions ,  and understanding their behaviour .  Horses ,  like people ,  have a number of essential needs ,  both physical and psychological .  Their physical needs are for food , water , <head>shelter</head> from extreme weather , a safe environment , sensory stimulation , light , exercise , and freedom from injury , pain , or parasites . Essential psychological needs are for companionship of other horses ,  affection ,  self - esteem ,  respect and acceptance by the herd ,  mental stimulation ,  and sufficient space .  Domesticated horses ,  again like ,  people ,  can be conditioned to have other needs too ,  and can learn to like or want something which would be of no interest to a wild horse .

Troughs should not be placed in the very corner of paddocks or yards .

It is essential to provide <head>shelter</head> for horses to protect them from the extremes of heat , cold , wind , or rain . ( It is also preferable to rug them in cold or wet weather ,  but they need to be under daily supervision in case the rug slips .  )  A desirable size for a shelter shed is about four by four metres ,  and closed on three sides .

In hilly country ,  horses always like to spend some of each day on the tops of the hills :  they need to satisfy their desire for the space and freedom that a hilltop provides .  So ,  if they are paddocked lower on a hillside ,  they frequently wear a track with restless pacing along the highest fence  rather than along any other. For this reason , if <head>shelter</head> sheds are placed in a paddock , they may have to be placed at the top of the hill and preferably near the gate . Horses tend not to use badly sited shelter sheds ,  no matter how hot or cold it is .  When horses are put together in paddocks ,  they need to be carefully chosen for their mutual compatibility .

In a small group there is less stress to the horses ,  especially those lower in the hierarchy ,  and it is also safer and more pleasant for the people handling and feeding them .  Obviously stallions and colts over ten months old need special arrangements ,  and brood mares and foals should have a paddock of their own ;  but sometimes other horses can be very aggressive .  Occasionally a gelding , or even a mare , may be so aggressive that there is a real possibility of it seriously injuring another horse , especially if there are <head>shelter</head> sheds another horse can be trapped in , although for some horses even the corner of the paddock is enough . As we have already mentioned ,  for this reason ,  shelter sheds and troughs are never placed in the very corners of paddocks or yards .

However ,  the horse in captivity usually cannot help itself in anxiety provoking situations :  it is dependent upon people for its reduction in anxiety ;  it relies upon people for its needs .  If the need is not satisfied it can have the most injurious results .  The need for food , water , and <head>shelter</head> is clear , but the horse 's other needs are less obvious . Horses need to be able to see different things happening around them ,  hear different sounds ,  and smell different smells ,  and so on :  they need variety and stimulation .  Lack of mental or sensory stimulation ,  in reality enforced boredom ,  is frequently imposed upon Thoroughbred race - horses ,  showhorses ,  and stallions ,  with devastating results .

Distressed by the cold it eventually leaves its mother 's  side and finds the warmth and comfort of the dry stable .  Incredibly ,  it may not be until several hours later that mum follows her baby inside !  Probably these seemingly unintelligent mares were unable to find <head>shelter</head> in such weather when they were young , and now as older horses they put up with such conditions out of habit a habit that is not conducive to the best health of the horse . Horses learn new things easily when they are young ;  it is actually easier for them to learn new things than it is for older horses .  There are two reasons for this .

Although they will gallop around trying to get rid of the bot - fly ,  they seem to quickly discover that the bot will not follow them into the dense shade of a shelter shed or stable .  Foals who have learnt to evade bot - flies in such a way ,  will continue to do so as adult horses if they have access to shelter. Older horses who do n't try and run away from bot - flies , usually have not had the use of <head>shelter</head> sheds when they were young , so have formed the habit of no longer attempting to evade these injurious insects . As we have seen ,  the establishment of a habit can create a situation where a horse refuses to think  irrespective of how intelligent a horse may be ,  and even if solving the problem is in the horse 's  own interests .  This became even more apparent to us when we tried to devise an intelligence test for horses .

In addition ;  Stalin realised that Russia was vulnerable from attack through Finland ,  so between the end of November 1939 and the spring of 1940 ,  Russian troops fought the Finish and achieved control of the Baltic States .  Back in Britain , men were called to arms ; everyone was issued with a gas mask ; sandbags were provided to protect specified buildings and to provide some <head>shelter</head> against the expected air attacks , and provision of Air Raid Shelters was hastened . Concern for the safety of young children resulted in a massive scheme to evacuate children from the vulnerable cities to safe homes in more isolated country areas .  Those endeavours were proved to be somewhat premature as no real bombing of cities occurred until the following year ,  and many of the  children had returned home only to have to be again evacuated when the bombing did start .

Typically of experienced teachers recognising the potential weakness of the whole venture  ( it will in fact only succeed if the pupils are determined to make  it succeed  not something one can often rely on !  )  ,  precautions were adopted such as warning them beforehand to mark out the route they take ,  and  ( the final card up teacher 's  sleeve as pupils start to get killed all over the place )  to come in as narrator saying ,  Suddenly ,  for no apparent reason ,  the danger passed and the members returned to safety !  The basic problem is that the givens are not clear enough .

But the location 's  convenience for those Oxbridge dons who formed the nucleus of the original community had weighed down the scales against possible danger of discovery ;  and this judgment was vindicated ,  because we were never bombed .

Various societies ,  at various times in history ,  have formally and officially treated the world with reverence .  Often these people believed that each of the components of nature  the forest ,  the rivers ,  the sky  was occupied and guarded by a jealous god ,  and they behaved as if that were the case .  Other societies , at other times , have simply regarded the elements of nature as commodities : sources of food , fuel , <head>shelter</head> , transport , and wealth . They have acted on the principle of out of sight ,  out of mind .  This latter attitude is not unique to modern times ,  or to western people .

But they are extremely important components of the tropical scene ;  rich in species and serving as nesting sites and nurseries for birds and fish .  Others  anemones ,  winkles ,  starfish  are affixed in or move into sheltered places ,  under rocks ,  and remain cool and reasonably moist and protected from pounding .  Seaweeds such as the brown kelp produce mucus - like materials to hold moisture , and in any case can survive desiccation ; and many animals , including shore crabs , <head>shelter</head> among their damp fronds . So the shore - line creatures adopt several different strategies for survival ;  and animals from very different phyla  notably coelenterates ,  molluscs ,  crustaceans ,  and echinoderms  have found  ( various )  ways of coping with the intertidal zones .  And although the number of species  in the intertidal zone is not necessarily enormous ,  individuals of those specialists that have evolved to cope are often present in very large numbers .

Mangroves are trees that grow right at the edge of the sea ,  held and nourished through characteristic prop roots that grip the soft mud .  They are not a specific kind of tree ,  but a way of being a tree ;  several unrelated species  ( black mangroves ,  white mangroves ,  etc )  are involved .  In Florida , the Caribbean , Queensland , and South East Asia they may be extremely extensive , and are important not only for the huge variety of life within them crabs , spiders , molluscs but also for the many creatures that visit them for food ( herons , egrets ) and which breed in the <head>shelter</head> they provide . In particular ,  mangroves are the nurseries for huge numbers of tropical fish ,  which as adults live in the open sea .  If mangroves are destroyed  ( as they often are ,  to create beaches and hotels  as in Miami )  then marine ecosystems a thousand miles away may suffer .

The rapidly increasing urban population has placed an impossible strain on the provision of housing .

Since the standard housing of towns and cities has been unable to provide <head>shelter</head> , urban populations have been compelled to take the situation into their own hands and put up their own homes . These squatter settlements have sprung up in great abundance ,  generally in undesirable and inaccessible areas ,  which are unsuitable for standard building .  The settlements are often found on steep slopes ,  such as those in Rio de Janeiro ,  which ever the hills behind the luxury tourist attractions of Ipanima and Copacabana beaches .

The Peruvian military reacted with force during the Pamplona invasion in May 1971 ,  when they tried to evict the tens of thousands who had participated in this huge squatter invasion in Lima ,  with the result that there were several injuries and one death  ( Collier 1975 )  .  Other governments have viewed the spontaneous housing settlements as wretched areas ,  which not only house society 's  drop - outs ,  but are also breeding grounds for crime and radical political activity The Brazilian government has tried to eradicate the squatter settlements for these reasons ,  which is especially the case in Rio de Janeiro ,  because of the added factor that it is an international tourist centre and the favelas  are so visible on the steep hillsides behind the luxury hotels and beaches .  Some of the favelas have been knocked down , but there still remains the problem of <head>shelter</head> for their inhabitants . As a result ,  when shacks disappear ,  others appear in other parts of the city .  The government has attempted some favela  removal programs ,  but these have not been very successful ,  mainly because  the new housing schemes are too expensive .

For many ,  the movement is one of  horizontal mobility rather than vertical .  Some of the discussion of the informal sector and the Turner thesis suggest that ,  for a minority ,  there may be small improvements in housing or occupation ,  but the majority remain part of the mass of the urban poor .

A red telephone box on a village green is part of the country scene ,  as quintessential in its way as the village pond or pub .  A red telephone box in such circumstances may not be special in itself ,  but special to the area .  Great care was taken in the early years of this century to design bus <head>shelters</head> that were in keeping with country villages . They are not only worth preserving in themselves ;  a watchful eye needs to be kept to ensure that some other piece of street furniture  say one of the new all - glass telephone boxes  is not crudely juxtaposed beside them .  An active local society needs to be in constant contact with not only the local authority but all the public utilities .

The caves gave <head>shelter</head> to a new generation of troglodytes European nomads , Australian girls ending their Grand Tours by going native , those few English women who had felt the lure of the desert so intently that they now nursed fair - haired , olive - skinned babies and hung their washing - lines from one eroded pinnacle to another . Another day I went into the Siq when the sun was setting and the air was already chill .  Smoke from charcoal fires swirled from these windowless dwellings .

The raids on the British cities were another matter .

I stood one night outside the air - raid <head>shelter</head> which we shared with neighbours , looking towards a great glow in the sky . Bristol was burning ,  and these were not the lights of Oxford with a message of unattainable ambition .  Cardiff High School lost most of its windows ,  but Latin grammar went on .

This change of emphasis from cash to produce is probably the most difficult mental hurdle .  Immediate cash profit has far too long been the overriding aim :  it has warped the genuine economy and forced farmers to consider every move in the context of How soon will it pay ?  Cash profits are necessary ; but the nearer a community can come to providing its own basic requirements of food , <head>shelter</head> , and energy , the less cash is needed for the luxuries . Within the pattern of large - scale commercial farming ,  the independent smallholder can still provide more than his share of surplus food for the urban population ,  yet keep as top priority the conservation of his main capital  the soil .  The acceptance of discipline is probably the greatest step towards freedom a man can take ,  and nowhere is this so true as in smallholding .

You should therefore devise a clear plan with priorities ,  and introduce your livestock bit by bit as your fencing permits .  By far the strongest and most permanent field divisions are stone walls .  Once built they will last forever , the materials for repairs are always on site , and they provide <head>shelter</head> from wind and weather . Few can afford the time and cost of building a new stone wall today ,  but the principles of dry stone walling ,  clearly outlined in Rainsford - Hannay 's  book Dry Stone Walling  ,  are straightforward and you can easily acquire enough skill to do effective repairs .  Well - laid hedges of thorn ,  hazel ,  holly ,  or beech  ( or more generally a mixture of several species )  form very effective barriers ,  and provide shelter for livestock and a habitat for wild life .

If this could be proved beyond doubt  ,  direct drilling would fit in well with the organic philosophy .  The drills are too expensive for a smallholding ,  and even in the hands of a contractor ,  the technique  ( including spraying )  is not cheaper than conventional tillage .  Perennial weeds such as couch or coltsfoot are more difficult to control , and slugs , which <head>shelter</head> and multiply in the deep , hard - sided slits , can become a serious pest . Winter cereals are slow to establish ,  and must be sown earlier :  this is apparently because there is a tendency for stubble or killed turf to be pushed down into the slits with the seed where it can create anaerobic conditions leading to the formation of toxic substances such as acetic acid .  But one might be forgiven for doubting if this is the most likely cause of the toxic side - effects of direct drilling !

It leads only to the Charles Inglis Clark mountain hut ,  a prestigious private hut owned by the Scottish Mountaineering Club and hence frequented by respectable rock - climbing doctors ,  lawyers and accountants .  The hut is in a most peculiar situation ,  perched perfectly as the map would imply ,  to receive the maximum effect of the avalanche loading slopes behind it .  Not only that , but one imagines such huts to be found in the very heart of the wilderness , where one cannot ascend a peak and walk out in a single day , and must take <head>shelter</head> for the night . Hardly the case here .  A resident at the C.I.C .  hut could easily do a spot of rock - climbing ,  nip into Fort William to indulge in some leisurely shopping for tartan gonks and still be back in time for a sing - song round the primus stove .

Most of the woodland is located on hill farms and unrestricted access by sheep is encouraged to provide winter <head>shelter</head> and year - round grazing . 85 %  of the woodland area is dominated by mature trees ,  indicating that grazing has been heavy enough for a long time to Prevent sapling recruitment .

Talbot Square now became a focal point on the tramway system ,  where the new town routes met the busy Promenade track ,  newly relaid and extended to the Gynn .  In 1902 ,  a direct line was laid up Clifton Street for the Marton cars to avoid the bottleneck on Talbot Road .  The two tram routes departed from opposite sides of the central loading island in the Square , where for many years there was an ornamental drinking fountain and later a stone <head>shelter</head> and underground toilets . In 1911 the Circular Tour was introduced to boost the finances of the Marton route ,  and toastrack cars became a regular sight in the Square ,  loading at the island before crossing the Promenade ,  and returning along Abingdon Street .  The imposing dome of the Winter Gardens dominated the street ,  and the track in the foreground became a siding for theatre   specials .

It is best ,  perhaps ,  not to speculate whether the hostelry still exists in which he discovered  a low - spirited little man sitting at an empty bar and hiding himself ,  as it were ,  from all mortal inspection behind the full sheet of a dirty provincial newspaper .  Doleful was our petition to this secluded publican for <head>shelter</head> and food , and doubly doleful was his answer to our appeal . It could only get worse for poor Mr Collins as room and meal  materialised ,  but at least he acknowledged of the Cornish in general that they had ,  no propensity to jeer at strangers .  But perhaps the most kindly and satisfying compliment to the Cornish was paid by one of the earliest tourists ,  John Taylor ,  in 1649

During the Second World War ,  when cattle food supplies were necessarily restricted so that the supposedly early maturing breeds were deprived of some of their rations ,  it was the Devon and the related Sussex which came to the fore and proved that ,  even under difficult conditions ,  they were able to produce good beef quickly .  They managed to finish on grass quite happily and their marbled ,  lean ,  tender beef caught the eye of the butchers ,  as it has for centuries .  In the 1960s the breed was exported to Canada and is thriving at altitudes of 1,400m on the eastern slopes of the Rockies with bitter winter temperatures and no more <head>shelter</head> than brush . They also thrive in Kenya on a farm at 1,800m above sea level ,  in a wet savannah climate where they are being used to improve native cattle .  There are breed societies in the UK  ( 1884 ;  herdbook 1851 )  ,  Australia ,  Brazil ,  New Zealand ,  South Africa and the USA .

The very fast ,  shallow water ,  often no more than a foot deep ,  is the place to fish for summer chub .  Here they have sought out the well - oxygenated water where the streamer weed grows thick and the natural food breeds in profusion .  The chub flit in and out of the weed like silent ghosts , grubbing for food , seeking <head>shelter</head> from the bright sun , and sometimes just playing around for the sheer hell of it . I tackle up with a through - action carbon rod ,  11ft long ,  a fixed - spool reel carrying 5lb b.s .  line to which a size 2 hook is tied direct .  No float is used ,  nor any weight ,  for the big slugs are heavy enough to cast the full width of most rivers ,  and to hold bottom in most weedy swims .

The cottage is essentially of the seventeenth century ,  but was restored in 1800 and greatly enlarged during the second half of the nineteenth century That ,  needless to say ,  was at best half the story ,  since Tom Poole 's  house had immediately become for Coleridge a spacious and comfortable refuge whenever Lime Street grew oppressive .  A gate set up by Tom Poole at the bottom of the Lime Street orchard led directly into his own garden , a small secluded area which lay at some distance behind Poole 's house in Castle Street and which contained , beneath the <head>shelter</head> of a lime - tree , a jasmine - covered arbour . ( A modern bungalow now occupies the site .  )  From this garden Coleridge could either walk on through Poole 's  orchard and a fine meadow to the home of his new friends ,  John and Anna Cruikshank ,  or he could negotiate Poole 's  tanyard and its Tartarean tan - pits to reach the Castle Street house itself .

It was also in the closing weeks of the year that long explorations of the Somerset landscape by Coleridge and the Wordsworths began to have far reaching creative consequences .  During one excursion which probably occurred at this time Tom Poole took his friends to Walford 's  Gibbet on the Quantock slopes between Holford and Stowey ,  and there recounted John Walford 's  tragic history .  Walford , a charcoal - burner who had spent his solitary life in a woodland <head>shelter</head> built of poles and turf , was remembered by Tom Poole as a man remarkable for good temper and generosity , but one who also possessed ardent feelings and strong passions . He was deeply in love with an Over Stowey woman called Ann Rice ,  but was forced into marriage to a half - mad girl who had visited him at his shelter and who bore him two illegitimate children .  They married in June 1789 ,  and a month later ,  in despair and rage ,  he murdered her as they walked in the darkness to the Castle of Comfort Inn .

Our connection for the prison camp did not leave until 11 o'clock and the Feldwebel was wondering what to do for the next two hours when the air raid siren blew .  It sounded the same as the English siren except that it was slower .  We went down into the station <head>shelter</head> and I experienced the familiar claustrophobic sensation of waiting for something to happen . The shelter was clean and well built .  Civilians sat on benches joking and playing cards and rocking screaming babies to sleep .

But this was not so ;  no one landing there had ever been able to get out and the nearest airport was 600 miles away .  The pilots and crew had ,  in some instances ,  been able to trek overland to safety but the aircraft ,  valued at many millions ,  would remain there imprisoned forever .  Late that afternoon we made a perfect three - point landing at the RCAF airstrip in Whitehorse , capital of the Yukon Territory , where I found <head>shelter</head> for the night in a bare but adequate room at the Whitehorse Hotel . Not far away a turgid and fast moving river rushed southward in narrow gorges .  Beached there were old weather - worn skeletons of the side - wheeler paddle boats formerly used for passenger service between Whitehorse and Dawson City .

Even before I got to understand guilt ,  I used to walk about the house muttering ,  You 're a subject for guilt ,  boy ,  a subject for guilt .

I wrapped guilt around me like a thick overcoat , wallowed in it and even took <head>shelter</head> in it . In almost anything that happened I could find guilt and apply it to myself .

Apart from the increased pressures on fuelwood ,  rubbish disposal is disfiguring the landscape ,  especially along the trail from Lukla ,  through Namche Bazar ,  to the Everest Base Camp .  Climbing expeditions into the peaks themselves have also left behind piles of rubbish ,  and Cullen  ( 1986 )  points out that the problem is compounded by the fact that in such a high Alpine environment decomposition rates are very slow so that discarded materials may persist for several years if not decades .  Moreover , expeditions tend to congregate in a few favoured areas which provide rapid access to peaks as well as adequate water supplies and <head>shelter</head> from natural hazards like avalanches . Add to this the rapid growth in the numbers of expeditions ,  climbers and trekkers which has occurred in recent years and it is not surprising that the problem has reached massive proportions despite the availability of new access sites from Tibet which was opened to climbers in 1980 .  Obviously ,  the harsh terrain and the inhospitable weather conditions mean that rubbish disposal is a subordinate concern ,  in relation to climbing goals and survival ,  of climbers in the mountain peaks ,  the major problem areas are the base camps .

Southworth et al.   ( 1989 )  have enhanced the MASSVAC model with the addition of a colour graphics module which they call MVOPL .  This module has been developed using IBM 's  Graphics Kernel System and provides a number of display screens .  The most interesting are those which portray population flows as scaled ribbons on the network diagram , and evacuation <head>shelter</head> capacities as bar diagrams . The diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation .  In dry parts of the world ,  such as Australia ,  forest and bush fires are an important natural hazard and some attention has been given to the ways in which GIS might help examine their potential impacts .

As we neared Arran the clouds became denser ,  and in turn cast deep shadows over the Firth and the Arran coast ,  or were lit up with a glow of intensely bright sunlight ;  while the glory of Arran ,  its mountain - peaks ,  were lost amid the clouds that enshrouded them .  On landing I sought for the cottage occupied by the Duke of Hamilton 's  piper ,  in which some friends had found most comfortable quarters the season before .  I found it preoccupied by a little company of artists , either professional or amateur , who made use of the rainy day by camping in the coach - house to sketch from its <head>shelter</head> a fine group of trees , with some good foreground rock and bracken , all within a stone - throw of the cottage . The piper 's  little girl was mounted on horseback ,  and dispatched to Brodick in quest of a lodging ,  and returned with the news that there was a spare room at the Boat - house .  The Boat - house became my roosting - place while under the shadow of the mighty mountain of the wind ,  Goat Fell .

None the less ,  Springhall is unwilling to conclude that young people were repressed by adults .  He asks rhetorically if there has been a deliberate conspiracy to keep adolescents in an inferior social and economic position .  In answering he correctly reminds us that young people are often of necessity in a subservient position as a result of their dependence on parents for food , clothing , and <head>shelter</head> ; teachers for schooling ; employers for employment ; skilled workers for instruction in apprenticed trades ; and on youth workers for leisure activities . On this basis he maintains that these adults should not be seen as agents of social control repressing the young  as reductionist social history might suggest  but as agents of socialization preparing them for their future roles as citizens in a society to which most adolescents gave unthinking and willing allegiance .  No one disputes that agents of socialization were hard at work on working - class adolescents .

Before the war began ,  listening to reminiscences of those who had experienced the last war and sensing their dread ,  I imagined that once a war had started ,  no one would ever be happy again .

The rationing of food and of clothes , the air raid warnings which sent us into <head>shelters</head> , the trains which ran late and were always overcrowded , these things became an accepted part of life . Far from the atmosphere of doom and gloom which I had imagined ,  there was far more camaraderie and cheerfulness than is shown nowadays .
