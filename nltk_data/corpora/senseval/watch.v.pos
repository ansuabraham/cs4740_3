The Cold War was at its height when Peter Benenson ,  the British lawyer ,  founded Amnesty ,  and three decades later it is hard to believe that the Moscow AI Group finally has permission to become part of Soviet life .  Similarly ,  the idea that a human rights concert should be held in the very stadium in Santiago where Allende 's  officers rounded up thousands of Chileans in 1973 ,  prior to committing gross violations ,  stretches the powers of credulity .  But incredulous , or not , the events happened ( millions of television viewers worldwide <head>watched</head> the Chilean concert ) and as such they typify the massive changes that Amnesty has undergone in its 30 - year history . Sadly ,  one thing has not changed in 30 years :  certain governments of the world still falsely imprison ,  torture and execute their citizens ,  regardless of internationally agreed standards that expressly forbid such abuses .  Around the world today ,  more than 100 countries still retain the death penalty ,  and two out of every three human beings live under governments that use torture and other cruel ,  inhuman and degrading treatment against them .

 So you want to be an Actor ?  Everyone who wants to act professionally should try to see as much drama as they possibly can and this means in the broadest sense , <head>watching</head> television , cinema , visiting the theatre and looking at the actor 's work carefully and analytically . It is also important that you try and evaluate the dramatic  experience of these different forms of presentation  this is worthwhile ,  because it will make you think about the different ways in which an actor can work and the various ways in which his skills are used .  Clearly ,  there is a difference in scale and dimension between the stage ,  the television screen and the cinema screen ,  which demand changes in direction and in acting technique .

One of the things you will notice when <head>watching</head> the television is that close - ups are used very effectively , and so it is of vital importance that the actor has absolute control over his/her face and expression . You should also look at the ways in which the physical movements of the actor are organised to suit the restraints of the small screen .  When we turn to the theatre the question of scale is also significant .

It also makes it possible to <head>watch</head> the towplane instead of the ground and , as on a landing , looking well ahead reduces the tendency to over - control . It is the speed with which the situation develops that causes the problem .  Usually the tow pilot receives no warning of the danger .

Having watched and assessed the track record of some young officer ,  the middle - ranking detectives will perhaps put him forward as a candidate ,  and I have watched as potential members were admitted only after a series of phone calls had ensured their acceptability to the department .  I have also seen written applications for the CID ridiculed by those inside ,  and listened to the expressions of disbelief that these nave applicants were so short of shillings that they did n't realise that admission was by invitation only .  I have also had to tell others they are unlikely to get in and then try to explain the politics of the department to them and <head>watch</head> their dismay when they realize that , perhaps regardless of merit , they do not fit in . Once inside ,  the new detective will quickly meld into the department 's  style ,  pursuing its rituals to form a new link in the tradition of the CID .

If your kick is such that you can pull it back and reassume your original stance ,  it is too weak to score .  This ,  of course ,  is a generalisation ;  you can withdraw a powerful kick where the opponent has impaled himself on it ,  because in this instance recoil gives you the required stability .  You should land ready to fight and <head>watch</head> out for the opponent 's foot sweep . Where the opponent does not advance on to your kick ,  you should generate extra range and power by sliding forwards slightly on the supporting leg as the kicking knee rises .  Preferably ,  you should use the front kick only when you have first moved out of line and the opponent is unable to respond powerfully .

In the Critique of Pure Reason  ,  Kant 's  aim was to show how objective experience is possible ,  to set out the conditions necessary for this ;  whilst Piaget 's  aim was to show ,  given certain Kantian assumptions ,  how objective experience  actually develops .  One of the conditions for ascribing to oneself experiences of a mind - independent reality ,  Kant argued ,  was that we should be capable of distinguishing between those sequences of perceptions  ( if you like ,  representations delivered up by the input systems )  which are determined by the movement of objects and those which are determined by our own movements .  In the former category we have , to take Kant 's example , <head>watching</head> a ship sailing upstream : here an object moves against a more - or - less stable background from ( say ) left to right . We have no option but to see it as movement from left to right .  To describe self - governed perceptual sequences ,  Kant gave the example of scanning the front elevation of a building ;  in doing which we  determine what we see and the order in which we see it  roof ,  front - door ,  top - left - hand window ,  and so forth .

I would say that the child is capable  more or less  of recognizing that other people have mental states different to his own .  Indeed it would be difficult to imagine how children were able to use language to communicate if no  such conception were present .  Moreover in other kinds of false belief experiment ( by Henry Wellman ) where three - year - olds <head>watch</head> a puppet make a mistake in searching , the children are quite capable of explaining the failure in terms of what the puppet is wrongly thinking . But competing with the conception of the other person 's  thoughts is the child 's  own  knowledge of the location of the coin .  This is up front in consciousness and it is this which determines his answer ,  in the absence of central control .

Musically inspired ballets Choreographers wishing to interpret music in dance terms are limited in several ways because their choice should not only determine the style of dance used and its phrasing but other factors which are an integral part of the score .  Their task is nowhere better summed up than by Ernest Newman , one of the great music critics of his day , who rarely <head>watched</head> ballet until intrigued by the news that Massine was creating ballets to Tchaikovsky 's fifth Symphony ( Les Prsages , London 1933 ) and to Brahms ' Fourth Symphony ( Choreartium , London 1933 ) . Newman was overwhelmed by the latter and wrote in The Sunday Times :   Strictly speaking no art is translatable into another ,  not even poetry into music .  The most we can get is convincing parallelisms between the two and the fact that some parallelisms are much more difficult than others and have hitherto not been attempted is no reason for denying that a choreographic genius like Massine has the right to attempt this .

Ashton and MacMillan adopt the same practice in their ballets which can be called classical in the court meaning of the term and whenever the music used is composed according to the formulae for classical composition .  They do this even though they may break the conventions from time to time .  They do it because they know the audience is <head>watching</head> a constantly evolving picture which is being drawn on , over , across and above a flat stage in front of a background . They know they must fill the empty space with movement ,  whether there is scenery in the background or where the costumes are at their simplest and the background merely a hint of some venue as ,  for example ,  in Symphonic Variations  or Requiem  ,  or even just shafts of light as in Monotones  .  It is useful for would - be choreographers to study the historical development of classical style so that they may stage a ballet in a traditional way when it has a story firmly linked to a particular time and place .

The types of character and the plots in which they play have existed since the Dorian mimes first began to lay the foundations of the theatre .  The art of mime was developed by the commedia dell'arte and is still being developed by such artists as Marcel Marceau and the mime theatres of Poland and Czechoslovakia .  Actors in travelling companies used to set up their stage in a town or village , mix among the inhabitants , <head>watching</head> and listening to the local news , gossip and scandal . They became adept at portraying well - known types such as the domineering wife ,  her hen - pecked husband ,  the poor widow anxious to get a son or daughter wed ,  the miser ,  the guardian or the severe nurse and at spotting any odd person or antics .  They were also fond of aping the grand manners of servants to aristocratic households and rich farmers .

The estimated 40,000 troops in Dese are being joined by the remnants of the defeated Third Army ,  which is struggling down the road or surrendering to the rebels .  One estimate puts government losses in the past four weeks at 20,000 killed ,  captured or deserted .

The unconditional Soviet support to the Kabul regime is on such a scale that the US and Pakistan cannot hope to match it .

Convoys half a mile long are <head>watched</head> over by scattered Afghan army outposts on the hills by the road . Drivers report no guerrilla attacks ,  even though security north of the Salang Tunnel has been largely handed over to local militia units and the army withdrawn .  After setting up a bitumen plant and providing earth - moving machinery ,  the Soviets helped cut a new road east of the old Salang Tunnel .

He made the comment in remarks to a visiting official from North Korea ,  one of only a handful of foreign countries to send special delegations for national day .  Others included East Germany ,  Cuba and the Soviet Union  a list that reflects China 's  sudden dependence on the Communist bloc for its friends .

( Indeed ,  the anti - vivisectionists were allowed a small but notable coup on this score :  Sue Crowshaw ,  badly disabled by rheumatoid arthritis ,  made a moving speech denying scientists the right to claim they were experimenting on her behalf .  )  Evidently wise to this fact ,  vivisectionists refused the Natural Concern team access to all their experiments save for some brain operations on rats .  It seems a fair bet that Joe Public finds it as hard to feel sorry for rodents as Winston Smith did , and though these lobotomised specimens were of the cuter white kind , it was possibly to <head>watch</head> this sequence without feeling many qualms . The emotional complexity of the debate was deepened by the fact that neither side had the monopoly of logic or charm :  Dr Colin Blakemore ,  though known as Dr Frankenstein ' to the yellow press for having experimented on animals eyes ,  seemed reasonable ,  persuasive and put - upon ;  Douglas Hogg ,  MP ,  also on the vivisectionist side ,  was quite startlingly and pointlessly rude .  Perhaps the most resonant phrases in the whole debate came from the pro - rights organiser who suggested that future centuries would come to regard our attitude to animals with the same horrified disbelief we now feel for the periods which practised slavery .

Despite the wind ,  the cross that followed was so accurate and inviting that Chris Malkin was able to rise to the ball and head it out of the reach of the sprawling Paul Heald to register his 10th goal of the season .

The Cold War was at its height when Peter Benenson ,  the British lawyer ,  founded Amnesty ,  and three decades later it is hard to believe that the Moscow AI Group finally has permission to become part of Soviet life .  Similarly ,  the idea that a human rights concert should be held in the very stadium in Santiago where Allende 's  officers rounded up thousands of Chileans in 1973 ,  prior to committing gross violations ,  stretches the powers of credulity .  But incredulous , or not , the events happened ( millions of television viewers worldwide <head>watched</head> the Chilean concert ) and as such they typify the massive changes that Amnesty has undergone in its 30 - year history . Sadly ,  one thing has not changed in 30 years :  certain governments of the world still falsely imprison ,  torture and execute their citizens ,  regardless of internationally agreed standards that expressly forbid such abuses .  Around the world today ,  more than 100 countries still retain the death penalty ,  and two out of every three human beings live under governments that use torture and other cruel ,  inhuman and degrading treatment against them .

The glider must be flown through the wake in the turbulent air near the ground .  ( Some people think that this might be dangerous for inexperienced students ,  but it does not seem to cause any particular problems in Australia .  )  It is impossible to <head>watch</head> the towplane and the ground ahead during the climb out so that in the event of a launch failure the glider pilot has to look for a field , whereas in the normal tow position he has a good view of the fields ahead all the time . There is also the additional hazard that if the rope breaks at the towplane end ,  it may fall over the glider ,  causing damage .  Normal low position

It is much safer to fly at five or even ten feet until the towplane leaves the ground .  This makes it much easier to avoid pitching oscillations .  It also makes it possible to <head>watch</head> the towplane instead of the ground and , as on a landing , looking well ahead reduces the tendency to over - control . It is the speed with which the situation develops that causes the problem .  Usually the tow pilot receives no warning of the danger .

Having watched and assessed the track record of some young officer ,  the middle - ranking detectives will perhaps put him forward as a candidate ,  and I have watched as potential members were admitted only after a series of phone calls had ensured their acceptability to the department .  I have also seen written applications for the CID ridiculed by those inside ,  and listened to the expressions of disbelief that these nave applicants were so short of shillings that they did n't realise that admission was by invitation only .  I have also had to tell others they are unlikely to get in and then try to explain the politics of the department to them and <head>watch</head> their dismay when they realize that , perhaps regardless of merit , they do not fit in . Once inside ,  the new detective will quickly meld into the department 's  style ,  pursuing its rituals to form a new link in the tradition of the CID .

If your kick is such that you can pull it back and reassume your original stance ,  it is too weak to score .  This ,  of course ,  is a generalisation ;  you can withdraw a powerful kick where the opponent has impaled himself on it ,  because in this instance recoil gives you the required stability .  You should land ready to fight and <head>watch</head> out for the opponent 's foot sweep . Where the opponent does not advance on to your kick ,  you should generate extra range and power by sliding forwards slightly on the supporting leg as the kicking knee rises .  Preferably ,  you should use the front kick only when you have first moved out of line and the opponent is unable to respond powerfully .

In the Critique of Pure Reason  ,  Kant 's  aim was to show how objective experience is possible ,  to set out the conditions necessary for this ;  whilst Piaget 's  aim was to show ,  given certain Kantian assumptions ,  how objective experience  actually develops .  One of the conditions for ascribing to oneself experiences of a mind - independent reality ,  Kant argued ,  was that we should be capable of distinguishing between those sequences of perceptions  ( if you like ,  representations delivered up by the input systems )  which are determined by the movement of objects and those which are determined by our own movements .  In the former category we have , to take Kant 's example , <head>watching</head> a ship sailing upstream : here an object moves against a more - or - less stable background from ( say ) left to right . We have no option but to see it as movement from left to right .  To describe self - governed perceptual sequences ,  Kant gave the example of scanning the front elevation of a building ;  in doing which we  determine what we see and the order in which we see it  roof ,  front - door ,  top - left - hand window ,  and so forth .

I would say that the child is capable  more or less  of recognizing that other people have mental states different to his own .

Moreover in other kinds of false belief experiment ( by Henry Wellman ) where three - year - olds <head>watch</head> a puppet make a mistake in searching , the children are quite capable of explaining the failure in terms of what the puppet is wrongly thinking . But competing with the conception of the other person 's  thoughts is the child 's  own  knowledge of the location of the coin .  This is up front in consciousness and it is this which determines his answer ,  in the absence of central control .

Out of the corner of my eye I <head>watched</head> him wipe himself with Kleenex tissues and drop them on the floor , indifferent to the smears of blood on them . He pulled on his trousers and went quickly over to turn up the music ,  moving his head from side to side in time to the beat .  He lay face down beside me ,  not knowing that I was now painfully aware that the threads which bound me to home and the inevitable marriage had snapped once and for all .

Musically inspired ballets Choreographers wishing to interpret music in dance terms are limited in several ways because their choice should not only determine the style of dance used and its phrasing but other factors which are an integral part of the score .  Their task is nowhere better summed up than by Ernest Newman , one of the great music critics of his day , who rarely <head>watched</head> ballet until intrigued by the news that Massine was creating ballets to Tchaikovsky 's fifth Symphony ( Les Prsages , London 1933 ) and to Brahms ' Fourth Symphony ( Choreartium , London 1933 ) . Newman was overwhelmed by the latter and wrote in The Sunday Times :   Strictly speaking no art is translatable into another ,  not even poetry into music .  The most we can get is convincing parallelisms between the two and the fact that some parallelisms are much more difficult than others and have hitherto not been attempted is no reason for denying that a choreographic genius like Massine has the right to attempt this .

Ashton and MacMillan adopt the same practice in their ballets which can be called classical in the court meaning of the term and whenever the music used is composed according to the formulae for classical composition .  They do this even though they may break the conventions from time to time .  They do it because they know the audience is <head>watching</head> a constantly evolving picture which is being drawn on , over , across and above a flat stage in front of a background . They know they must fill the empty space with movement ,  whether there is scenery in the background or where the costumes are at their simplest and the background merely a hint of some venue as ,  for example ,  in Symphonic Variations  or Requiem  ,  or even just shafts of light as in Monotones  .  It is useful for would - be choreographers to study the historical development of classical style so that they may stage a ballet in a traditional way when it has a story firmly linked to a particular time and place .

The types of character and the plots in which they play have existed since the Dorian mimes first began to lay the foundations of the theatre .  The art of mime was developed by the commedia dell'arte and is still being developed by such artists as Marcel Marceau and the mime theatres of Poland and Czechoslovakia .  Actors in travelling companies used to set up their stage in a town or village , mix among the inhabitants , <head>watching</head> and listening to the local news , gossip and scandal . They became adept at portraying well - known types such as the domineering wife ,  her hen - pecked husband ,  the poor widow anxious to get a son or daughter wed ,  the miser ,  the guardian or the severe nurse and at spotting any odd person or antics .  They were also fond of aping the grand manners of servants to aristocratic households and rich farmers .

This moment is the proper conclusion that sums up what has now been accomplished .

( Indeed ,  the anti - vivisectionists were allowed a small but notable coup on this score :  Sue Crowshaw ,  badly disabled by rheumatoid arthritis ,  made a moving speech denying scientists the right to claim they were experimenting on her behalf .  )  Evidently wise to this fact ,  vivisectionists refused the Natural Concern team access to all their experiments save for some brain operations on rats .

The emotional complexity of the debate was deepened by the fact that neither side had the monopoly of logic or charm :  Dr Colin Blakemore ,  though known as Dr Frankenstein ' to the yellow press for having experimented on animals eyes ,  seemed reasonable ,  persuasive and put - upon ;  Douglas Hogg ,  MP ,  also on the vivisectionist side ,  was quite startlingly and pointlessly rude .

Robson , who <head>watched</head> Rocastle last Saturday , said : He has made a good start to the season . When he got on as a substitute against Sweden he was first class ;  in Albania he was one of our best players .  Steve McMahon ,  who is to deputise in midfield for the injured Neil Webb ,  missed England 's  workout at Bisham Abbey yesterday along with Gary Stevens ,  Tony Adams ,  Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker ,  but their injuries are slight .

You begin to feel dizzy with history .  Of course ,  the well - groomed head of modern Bruges pops up all over the place to remind you that this is not really a medieval theme park at all .  On Saturday morning , we <head>watched</head> outside the Stadhuis , where couples still marry in the Gothic hall . Limousines drew up to disgorge a wedding party ;  women in elegant outfits topped with splendid hats were a fanfare for a bride who stepped out of an old white Daimler ,  tanned beneath her white silk .  Very bourgeois ,  but that is probably what Bruges has always been .

Nowadays the bourgeoisie is more likely to patronise the city 's  luxurious food and clothes shops ,  all housed in the medieval streets .  The oldest tavern is the Vlissinghe ,  of which mention was first made in 1552 ,  but there are hundreds of little bars and cafes ,  many of them housed in olde - worlde buildings that have the Americans squealing with delight .  Plenty have terraces from which to <head>watch</head> the world go by accompanied by a hot waffle or a glass of beer . There were once 40 breweries in Bruges ,  and although now there are only two ,  the choice of Belgian beers is still enormous .  One cafe lists 300 .

His dog - leg patrimony  ( his uncle was Lord Chelmsford )  has enabled him to support himself and to help some others .  His books must sell ,  but he does not think of himself as an author .  Walking briskly towards Sloane Square to get some lunch at his club , he said : In Kenya , I like to sit in a car and <head>watch</head> the world go by . I do n't want to do that in the King 's  Road .  He is a man in thrall to the gaudy ,  tattered pageant of Africa .

By DEREK WALLIS Tranmere Rovers .  .  .  .  3 Leyton Orient .  .  .  .  .  .  0 TRANMERE ROVERS ,  who in recent years have survived a threat of extinction as well as only just preserving League membership ,  reinforced their position as Third Division leaders by overcoming Leyton Orient ,  thereby stretching the margin to four points .  The customary gallery of managers and scouts assembled to <head>watch</head> on a night when a chill , blustery wind made the measurement of passes difficult with the result that the match and Rovers in particular took time to warm up - until the 20th minute . A cute backheeled pass by Ian Muir set John Morrissey free on Rovers '  right .  Despite the wind ,  the cross that followed was so accurate and inviting that Chris Malkin was able to rise to the ball and head it out of the reach of the sprawling Paul Heald to register his 10th goal of the season .
