The authorities said that Hong Song - dam was not imprisoned merely for sending his paintings to North Korea and books to Koreans in Germany ,  but because his paintings and contributions to a magazine Art Movement  were aimed at promoting a Marxist - Leninist revolution .

In January 1991 Hong Song - dam was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment for <head>producing</head> material benefiting North Korea . Chang Ui - gyun continues to serve an eight - year sentence for espionage .

Wlflinn himself describes the Bernini statues at some length but at no point does he ever mention the subject Wlflinn was trying to isolate a visual denominator which ,  he claimed ,  was common to all works produced at the same time .  The history of forms in art has had some distinguished advocates , some of whom have been concerned with the transformation over time of one form to another ; others have been more attracted to problems of values , arguing either that styles in art change and decay , or that in a particular period there is an artistic will to <head>produce</head> work in a style of its own . These are matters which border on philosophy .  Eternal values can also be sought in art ,  as they were by the French art historian &Eacute ; lie Faure ,  whose open mind accepted disparate arts ,  a view which he expressed like this :  It is  not paradoxical at all to affirm that an Ivory Coast mask and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel express the same need to manifest a harmonious rapport which exists between mankind and the universe .

The second sentence of the issue of May 1988 refers to the first twenty years of the state :  Threatening to push the Jews into the sea ,  the Arab world reformulated the Nazi theory of Lebensraum  in Mediterranean terms :  there was no room in the region for a Jewish homeland .  Arabs who had been expelled from their land and thrust into the condition of Jewish refugees are hereby reformulated as imperialist aggressors and as Nazis .  This is reminiscent of the sort of inversion a fault - finding literary criticism can <head>produce</head> which is not to deny , which is indeed to admit , that the Arab leaders and polemicists of the region have had their faults , including some of those which have been identified over the years by Commentary .

Because such religious orders are themselves controlled from Rome ,  Roman discipline is conveyed via a route other than by the bishops .  Even so ,  some orders still remain slightly independent from Rome ,  particularly the religious orders of solemn vows ,  whose existence preceded the reformation .

Despite their dependency on Rome ,  the jesuits too have been important innovators on the contemporary scene in Ireland ,  particularly in the areas of education for ecumenism and industrial relations .

Criticism of the Irish constitution itself from both clergy and laity <head>produced</head> one first change in the constitution . The famous paragraph of Article 42 intending to give pride of place to the Roman catholic church in the state was removed by referendum in 1972 ,  along with the accompanying paragraph recognizing other existing religious groups .

A proposal before the Church of Ireland synod in May 1979 to support interdenominational education was defeated ,  despite pressure from its ecumenical lobby .  The main grounds appeared to be  the danger which it might pose to the small Southern protestant minority by encouraging mixed marriages .  However , no evidence favouring such a contention has ever been <head>produced</head> . Harry MacAdoo ,  then the Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin ,  on several occasions put forward the argument that Southern protestants were a minority group with their own culture and traditions ,  and thus deserved to have schools for themselves in order to hand on their own traditions .  When considering the merit of this argument ,  one does have to bear in mind the particularly precarious nature of the Southern protestant grouping .

It has been argued that catholic schools do not do the job for which they were set up ,  that is educate Roman catholics sufficiently to keep them in the church .  Irish bishops have been well aware of Spencer 's   ( 1968 )  research .  Using traditional measures of religiosity , he has pointed out the apparent failure of English catholic schools to <head>produce</head> better catholics and fewer ex - catholics than state or other schools , and has inferred the likelihood of the same for Irish schools . Spencer 's  argument has been banded about from time to time .  This is not unnatural ,  as in the 1970s and early 1980s Spencer was at the Queen 's  University ,  Belfast ,  and an active member of the All Children Together Movement .

In the light of W. McCready 's  findings in another study that the religious behaviour of the father had a greater impact on children ,  Greeley considered the fact that catholic schools were having an increasing influence on men to be of significant importance for the future of Roman catholicism in the USA  ( 1976 :  1735 )  .  Clearly ,  the follow - up study was more favourable to the defenders of catholic schools than to opponents .  However , Greeley and Rossi 's work also has been used to uphold the defenders ' argument that , though Roman catholic schools varied in their efficiency , they were certainly better than any possible alternative in terms of <head>producing</head> good Roman catholics . Thus ,  both sides have tended to use social scientific research to make statements in general about catholic schools which have been drawn from other countries and ,  therefore ,  beyond the cultural confines within which Irish catholic schools exist .  This is something  for which surveys ,  including that of Greeley and Rossi ,  are not and cannot be intended .

As the roots begin to break out of the grains the barley is transferred to a vast hall heated with warm air and turned by large malt shovels .  When the maltster is satisfied that germination has unlocked the rich natural sugars in the barley ,  the grains are taken to a kiln room where heat stops germination .  The temperature of the kilning process determines the type of malt <head>produced</head> : the higher the temperature the darker the malt . The malt is now ready for brewing .  In the brewery it is milled into a powder called grist and then mixed with hot water  ( known as liquor in breweries )  in a vessel called a mash tun .

Yeast is made up of millions of tiny fungus cells which literally go berserk when confronted by a liquid rich with sugars .  Within a few hours a scum appears on top of the wort and this rapidly builds up into a great yellowy - brown crust as the yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide .  The system used in Britain to <head>produce</head> mild , bitter , stout and strong ales is called warm fermentation , using a special type of top fermenting yeast . This means that the yeast ,  encouraged by the warmth of the wort and the temperature of the brewery ,  works quickly and vigorously on top of the wort to produce alcohol .  After 47 days most of the sugars have been turned into alcohol and the yeast begins to sink to the bottom of the vessel .

Keg ,  which includes lager ,  is known in the industry as brewery conditioned beer .  Instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to add a full ,  mature palate ,  keg beers are killed off in the brewery by a number of unnatural processes that affect the taste and quality of the product .  The aim is to <head>produce</head> beers quickly which , because they are sterile and have a long shelf life , are also highly profitable . Where keg milds and bitters are concerned ,  when fermentation is complete they are conditioned for a short period in tanks under a heavy blanket of carbon dioxide .  They are then chilled and filtered to remove the remaining yeast and are usually pasteurised as well to ensure that death is complete .

What the Campaign is against is fake ,  poor quality imitation lagers being foisted on unsuspecting drinkers and passed off as being genuinely European or Australian .

Beer is classified as a food stuff and yet it is excluded from the legal requirements to list ingredients .  Drinkers have a right to know whether the beer they are drinking is a genuine barley malt product or whether it is stuffed full of such tasty ingredients as corn syrup ,  propylene glycol alginate ,  amyloglucosidase ,  papain enzymes and potassium metabisulphite .  All these ingredients and additives were used to <head>produce</head> Miller Lite in the US until there was an outcry from consumers .

Much of this is due to the face that ,  following the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on pub ownership ,  many breweries are actually moving out of brewing itself and concentrating instead on pub management  an area where they believe they stand to make the greatest profits .  At the end of the 80s the famous Manchester firm of Boddingtons sold its brewing operation to Whitbread ;  yet during 1988 alone ,  Claire Hunt has noted ,  Boddingtons undertook the refurbishment of 50 of their tied houses .  More recently , at the end of 1990 the regional brewing giant Greenall Whitley announced that it was closing both its breweries at Warrington and Nottingham ( formerly the independent Shipstone 's brewery ) to concentrate solely on running pubs contracting out its beer to be <head>produced</head> by former rivals Allied Breweries . The principal victims or beneficiaries of this change of direction are the historic tied houses .  And the principal problem facing them today is the replacement of genuine and much - loved historical features by bogus period fittings  which are invariably couched in a vaguely Victorian or Edwardian sham - historical style .

A blurred blueness in the distance ,  Capri ,  indeed ,  was the little wallowing tub 's  destination .  Really ,  exclaimed in heavily scandalized tones one of the few other passengers braving the last gusts of a salt - laden sirocco up on deck ,  an Englishwoman in an ample frock loud with different coloured daisies .  But , finding her exclamation had <head>produced</head> no reaction in the only other passenger not comfortably below , save in the stem for a scatter of peasants returning with emptied baskets from Naples , she moved nearer along the ship 's greasy rail . Her target was an excessively tall gangling gentleman ,  not very suitably clad for the Mediterranean in a suit of gingery wool with the trousers ending in tight bands round the calves .  He was leaning against the rail smoking a cigarette and staring with an air of melancholy towards the distant island .

It was to her own surprise that Muriel Box ,  the director of 14 modest budget feature films between 1951 and 1964 ,  found herself an inspiration and a role model for a new generation of women film - makers ,  critics and students .  She was rediscovered as a film - maker in the early 80 's  ,  and a series of retrospectives and tributes culminated in 1990 at the International Festival of Women 's  Films in Creteil ,  where a programme of her work was feted by capacity audiences .  Her first husband was Sydney Box , the writer - director who became head of production at Gainsborough Studios ; and her sister - in - law was the Miss Box Office who <head>produced</head> the wildly successful DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE films over two decades . But Muriel 's  climb to film direction was slow and gradual ,  and she began her apprenticeship as a typist and then continuity girl ,  rising throughout the studio hierarchy .  She wrote theatre plays ,  often for all women casts ,  which anticipated her work on Gainsborough films ,  with their dominant roles for women stars and strong appeal to women audiences .

Many gardeners collect and store seeds from their garden plants ,  which is an economical practice ,  especially in the case of outstanding vegetables ,  flowering plants and sports or other unusual forms .  It is not really worth saving seeds from F1 hybrids or from most fruit varieties as these rarely reproduce true to type .  Variegated varieties will often <head>produce</head> green plants from seed , and seedlings from a flower mixture may not represent the full range of colours . You should gather seeds from the best plants only ,  if possible selecting and marking them early on and removing all but one or two of the first ,  fattest seed - heads to conserve as much energy as possible .  A plant left to fully ripen all its seeds will probably stop flowering or cropping before its neighbours .

For these reasons ,  when tackling the problem of gardening in the shade it is important to choose plants proficient at extracting energy from limited sunlight .  Mere tolerance of shade is not enough .  Some species may be receiving sufficient light to grow plenty of healthy foliage , but will always lack that little extra needed to <head>produce</head> flowering shoots . Variegated plants will start to make more chlorophyll in their leaves in response to restricted sunlight ,  and so tend to turn green in the shade .  Others need precise daily rations of sunlight that change with the seasons if they are to start flowering at a particular time .

Later ,  when the wind has picked up ,  the gliders weathercock round and can be free to tip over so that the into - wind wing is upwards .  Another hazard is the wind swinging and increasing during the day so that the glider ends up parked facing directly into the wind .  If the glider is facing across the wind with the into - wind wing held down , the wind will be blowing on to its top surface , <head>producing</head> an extra down - load . However ,  in a strong wind several tyres are required to stop the into - wind wing lifting up. The upper tip will be high in the air where the wind is stronger ,  while the lower wing will be close to the ground where the wind is much lighter .

It is a frightening experience ,  and I have never heard of anyone doing it a second time .  With a trailer that you have not towed before ,  your first priority should be to explore its stability carefully .  You can do this by driving on a quiet , wide road with no traffic about , gradually increasing your speed and moving the steering slightly to <head>produce</head> a very slight weave . As the speed is increased ,  the damping  becomes less and you will be able to decide on a reasonable limit to keep to for the first half hour .  By then you will have become tuned in to the driving and will be better able to judge if it is safe to go a little faster .

In flight ,  the directional or weathercock stability is maintained by the fin and rudder ,  which provide extra side area behind the c.g .  Thus with the aileron and rudder held in a central position ,  a glider will always weathercock into line with the relative airflow ,  just as the wind vane on a church steeple will always swing into the wind .  When rudder is applied , the nose of the glider yaws to the side until the force <head>produced</head> by the rudder is balanced by the tendency for the aircraft to swing back into line with the airflow . ( In the air this is nothing to do with the actual wind .  The aircraft is flying in a mass of air which may be stationary or moving .  )

In windy weather ,  the effects of the wind gradient near the ground accentuate any movement up or down of the towplane and glider .  If the towplane gains speed by flying close to the ground ,  when it noses up to start climbing ,  the effect of the wind gradient accentuates the climb so that the glider may easily be left flying close to the ground ,  in or near the wake and below the tug .  Then , when the glider pilot recognises he is far too low , any quick movement to regain position takes the glider up through the same wind gradient , causing a sudden surge of speed and <head>producing</head> an unexpected and possibly uncontrollable gain of height . At the same time ,  the extra load in the tow rope accentuates the nose - up pitching movement on the glider  ( as in a winch launch )  .  This slows down the towplane ,  leaving it at low speed below the glider and having its tail pulled up out of control .

Never having shown the same propensity as the French for violent revolution ,  the dispossessed have entered into a complex ritual of action within the processes of the criminal justice system ,  and in doing so have encouraged those tasked with their containment to consider them as being less than human and therefore needing further control and discipline .  As Wilson  ( 1981 )  ,  Reiner  ( 1985 )  ,  and others have clearly identified ,  policing is basically a socio - political tool of the state and government .  It is sustained by an intimate knowledge of its enemy the underclass of society and exemplary use is made of this knowledge to <head>produce</head> the technological and structural means for the continuity of this system of power . As we shall see ,  there is now a specifically created police culture of the dramatic ,  which incorporates illusion ,  praxis ,  and imagery as part of a well - directed social production .  It rejoices in an enhanced belief in Manichaean and mythological archetypes of good and evil which are made manifest in exaggerated games of cops and robbers .

Such a mood of concern has existed now for more than a decade and seems to mirror uncertainties of role occurring elsewhere in society .  For example ,  it can be argued the expansion into amalgamated police units has enlarged the organization to a point where it is no longer accessible to the man in the street ;  alternatively ,  it may be that the use of a centralized computer and complex technical aids has alienated the public even at the same time they are increasingly fed a diet of violent news snippets which reinforce a fear of crime and generate another folk devil of criminal menace ,  which demands the impossible :  a policeman on every corner .  In nightly theatrical TV rituals of social order and chaos , a stream of hero - policemen stand at the symbolic crossroads between peace and mayhem , and the detective and the chief officer now operate at the point where once the church and its priests declaimed on categories of good and evil and the resulting binary codes they <head>produce</head> . Inevitably ,  as a secular interpretation of morality has superseded that of established religion ,  so the  activities of the social controller have become increasingly important in the drama .  It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have remained the province of the archbishop and his clergy .

the report is certainly not a definitive and unchallengeable portrait of the Metropolitan police .

This attack was repeated again in 1987 in the Federation magazine ,  for the report had obviously hit a very raw nerve .

Nor will he be able to take a sabbatical to formulate the complex structures of meaning lodged deep in the empirical material ,  which Lvi - Strauss  ( 1976 :  80 )  has argued are capable of linking together symbolic and metaphoric programmes to reveal properties not immediately accessible to the  ( empirical )  observation .  To coin another military metaphor ,  he must soldier on knowing that all of this activity might well smack of sedition .  Even the fact that someone inside is writing fieldnotes will <head>produce</head> unease , as I have experienced ; and their collation can almost certainly be tantamount to something akin to espionage ; for as Sean Conlin ( 1980 ) observed : often our work can seem political rather than scientific .

Furthermore ,  as these college - based insiders stress ,  their essays do not represent police college views or those of the Home Office ;  and both Thackrah  ( 1985 )  and his publisher ,  James Tindall ,  take pains to ensure from the outset that we are aware than any views expressed in the book are those of individual contributors ,  and not those of the college ,  the Home Office ,  or even the police service .  One might suggest then that the major project Holdaway recognized was missing from the college inventory is still to come !  Indeed the anonymous reviewer of the Pope and Weiner edition went on to propose that if the police staff college is to fulfil its task of <head>producing</head> a major project with any credibility , it must encourage its academic staff to go out into the field to study policing at first hand . Other challenges to social researchers to pursue a form of participant observation are to be occasionally found in the journals :  questions were being raised about what the police were doing ,  what they ought to be doing and how they ought to be organised and accountable .

He dismissed this as irrelevant and his use of metaphor ,  in what  turned out to be an eighty - minute interview ,  was most revealing .  I later recorded he invariably used the idea of an escape from real work to describe any research secondment ;  in doing so he embodied the common institutional fear of uncontrolled social movement across a divide or boundary into another society such as academia .  This is part of the ideological pedagogy which the institution uses to create and maintain defensive boundaries against the outsider or those who might <head>produce</head> a critical analysis of its systems ; it is one major strength of the organization . Again ,  as I recorded in a fieldnote ,  this assistant chief exhibited aspects of what I could only then describe as institutional paranoia ,  when he went on to deride an unnamed social scientist who had been allowed research facilities inside a police force  ( unspecified )  .  He dismissively described how this man had come in ,  taken the material provided ,  and then had written a childish and critical book on the police ,  out of which he got a Ph.D .

To have advanced within the job and achieved rank means he is likely to have followed and supported institutional precedents without question ,  and to have unwittingly accepted and been involved in the reproduction of the narrow modes of thought and practice demanded by the culture .  It is this special knowledge ,  or gnosis ,  which hopefully can make the inside ethnography so different and illuminating .  Burridge ( 1969 ) has written most persuasively about the effects which fieldwork can have on the anthropologist , describing the prophetic experience this can <head>produce</head> . He links this to the act of consciousness raising ,  which I consider presents the greatest problem for the insider who cannot leave the field or return to academia .  The insider/ethnographer can turn his understanding of an interpretive methodology to an assessment of his own actions ,  and see connections as if scales had been removed from his eyes .

By consciously using subjectivity as a research tool ,  the insider is peculiarly placed to generate what Geertz  ( 1976 )  described as an inward conceptual rhythm ,  moving between the particular and the general .  Hopefully ,  he can use the creativity which exists between the experiential inside view and observational outside view of a cultural system to formulate an ethnography which incorporates a continuous dialectical ,  tacking between the most local of detail and the most global of global structures in such a  way as to bring them into simultaneous view  ( Geertz ibid .  235 )  .  But it is not just how the new consciousness is to be used which <head>produces</head> problems in handling this new - found wisdom ; it is the very acquisition of knowledge itself which makes the concept of self so dynamic . This structural awareness can be as hard to handle as any decision to try to publish the account ,  for what has happened in the past and what is expected now from the insider is tied up with an understanding of how the institution of policing prefers to present a restricted image for outside consumption ,  as I have described above .  It all becomes uncomfortably apparent and that which had been lived and accepted is opened up in a revelatory manner ,  so that the vice of being caught up within the hegemonies of such a system designed to control a powerless underclass can become overbearing .

Once the semantics of police experience were revealed ,  I had to live with the problems experienced by both Castenada and Favret - Saada ,  although I demur from casting myself into their intellectual companionship .  Reality itself then became a construct of knowing and being known ,  and of living with the alternative possibility .  For personal transitions made across physical and psychic boundaries during the subjectivity of the field situation can <head>produce</head> disjunction ; indeed they can paralyse . In such a situation it is therefore all the more necessary to recognize the unique place the ethnographer holds and to capitalize on it .  During this time of subjective observing participation ,   the policeman/insider moves to the margins ,  to a point where analysis negates automatic approval or predisposition for a world of known categories and classifications .

By  defining  this insider fieldwork  ( and the university experience which generated it )  as a liminal situation ,  I am extending the Turnerian concept  ( 1969 ,  1974 )  in which the individual moves temporarily into an unstructured and somewhat ambiguous state ,  during the initial process of passing through a rite de passage  before returning to structure .  Here the marginality is less transitory and occurs in the post - tribal situation where the concept of liminality is less familiar to the discipline ,  even though transitions across spatial and temporal boundaries still create epistemological changes of the kind Turner describes .  In my own case , the model of transition through liminality might still <head>produce</head> a recognizable replication of the move through a rite de passage : policeman  student  new policeman But there seems more to it than that !

I suspect it is no  accident the politics of the times seems to parallel the growing toughness of the police image ,  or that the police have taken on an increasing resemblance to the black - clothed enemies of goodness who sprinkle the popular science fantasy films such as Star Wars ,  Superman  ,  and the like .  In these mass cultural replays of the eternal dichotomy between good and evil ,  the use of highly symbolic black uniforms as an indicator of anonymous evil predominates .  Within the separate police forces , the nuances of uniform difference were always embroidered by real polises to <head>produce</head> symbolic boundaries from which to assess other uniform wearers . Thus our contacts with firemen ,  St John Ambulance men ,  special constables ,  and the like were all used to define them as being somewhat unreal and therefore slightly less than human .  Such groups were said to be like the foreigners in the adjacent forces ,  for it was constantly repeated that many wanted to join us but failed because of some inadequacy .

His real work always lies in the bodily activity of physically capturing the prig ,  often to have this dangerous business transformed by a detective who then negotiates justice with the adversary ,  in the essential CID cause of returning a good detection rate .  As a result ,  the uniform polises often complain that the quality of prig has been forsaken to be replaced by quantity .

In contrast nailing the prig down is a quintessential statement about the value to uniform polises of stasis ,  containment ,  and spatial control .  Such vivid ,  metaphoric language epitomizes and illustrates the ultimate truths and values of the police world .  In effect , even those who move across the margins into CID work have <head>produced</head> the first structural crack in the preferred coherent model of uniformed and unitary policing . FURTHER INTO LIMBO In 1966 I moved from the world of real polising into areas of operational marginality which were further to confound the preference for the clearly delineated police world I had been brought up in .

The philosophy which they never tired of expounding to us included visions of a new world ,  which although sketchy and inevitably idealistic often showed an artistic and positively creative side to their existence .  It was often difficult to dislike the gentle ,  painted hippies ,  even though they subscribed to a strange new communal ,  non - hierarchic lifestyle incorporating the unlawful use of dope .  This undermined any pre - ordained police logic we might have employed to define them , so that pressures to <head>produce</head> a unidimensional model of polis prig were simply unable to be maintained , although we did home in on such facets as their long hair and frequently unwashed state to polarize them as binary animals , in contrast to our human status . And so although they were still the opposition ,  they could rarely be classified as real prigs .  We therefore became aberrant policemen simply because what we were now living was not programmed by previous organizational knowledge and habit .

As I have indicated ,  the requirements for competition are slightly different ,  but we can use the fitness built up through normal training to provide a platform upon which to establish more specialised requirements .  Thus you will already be aerobically fit ,  that is able to sustain a relatively low work - load over a long period .  If this is the case , then your first objective is to raise the level of work you can do before sliding too far into fatigue - <head>producing</head> anaerobic respiration . The longer you stave that off ,  the less time you will spend building fatigue toxins .  Some people would argue that the bout is too short to require any form of aerobic training .

Always taper your training down at the end of a workout ;  do not stop suddenly because this can cause fainting or dizziness .  Begin increasing training intensity as soon as you can last the 20 minutes .  Eventually , you will be able to work higher and higher into the aerobic band , thus staving off reliance on fatigue - <head>producing</head> anaerobic respiration . As you approach the time of competition ,  begin interval training in your aerobic band by working very hard to raise the pulse rate almost into the anaerobic threshold ,  then easing up to drop the pulse rate down into the lower third of the band .  This is an invaluable part of your preparation .

Quite apart from his business acumen  ( by the end of his commercial life he was the head of the largest clothing manufacturers  which his father had acquired earlier ,  originally named Freedmans  in the British dominions ,  as well as chairman or president of the most  important trade bodies related to that industry )  he held very senior positions in such organisations as the Baron de Hirsch Institute ,  the Montreal Reform Club ,  the Montefiore Club ,  the Montreal Insurance Co ,  the Jewish Public Library ,  the Hebrew Educational Institute ,  the Canadian Jewish Committee for the Relief of War Sufferers in Europe ,  the Executive of the Canadian Jewish Congress ,  the Canadian Colonisation Committee ,  the Zion Athletic Club ,  the Zionist Organisation of Canada ,  and many ,  many more .

An odd diversion ,  perhaps ,  from one of the country 's  leading constitutional lawyers ,  but he was seized of the gift ,  and so the poetry became assertive .

When this picture was fully developed ,  even space was represented not as being qualitatively the way it is in vision ,  but as a structural isomorph of visual and tactile space .  By this point ,  every knowable quality was confined to the mind .  But the modern behaviourist and functionalist analyses of mind treat mental states as mere powers to <head>produce</head> behaviour : that is , they abolish the intrinsic qualitative content of mental states , replacing it by causal , hence relational , properties . We have then reached the absurd position that nothing in the world possesses a knowable intrinsic or qualitative nature ,  for all properties are essentially relational .  This predicament arises out of the demise of consciousness ,  when only consciousness ,  understood in a traditional way ,  can bring us face to face with ,  and hence give us any grasp on ,  the qualitative ,  as opposed to relational ,  properties .

Paradoxically ,  associationism is anathema  to representational theorists like Fodor ;  and Fodor criticizes connectionism  ( see Chapter 7 )  for inheriting all the problems of associationism .  But a picture of the mind as consisting of atomic mental states causally interacting is not a million miles from the Humean view  a view of which Hume himself was the most insightful critic .  On a more phenomenological level , if we wanted some visual analogue to the associationist view of mental life we could not do much better than think of one of those psychedelic slide - shows popular in the late 1960s , in which lights were projected through oil , <head>producing</head> coloured globs which met , merged and repelled in a series of kaleidoscopic patterns . Every emerging pattern was explicable in terms of principles of local association .  From the standpoint of constructivism ,  the reason why associationist - representational theories so spectacularly fail to capture the essence of thought is that they ignore the fact that every thought ,  like every action ,  has ,  at some level ,  a purpose .

These obviously have considerable clinical value for localizing and identifying areas of brain abnormality ,  but they also enable areas of activity in the normally functioning brain to be pictured .  The resolution of these pictures is still relatively coarse and they <head>produce</head> only a stationary image at a single moment in time . Nevertheless ,  they have demonstrated activity in the visual areas during an imaging task ,  in the language areas during a verbal task and even ,  on one  -  occasion ,  in the higher visual areas of a schizophrenic patient who subsequently reported that he had been hallucinating .

We have no way of knowing exactly when these experiences took place .  All we can reasonably conclude is that they happened at the same time .

( Another useful illusion is that of the instantaneity of experience .

Recent experiments on the psychophysiology of selective attention by ,  for example ,  Steven Hillyard at San Diego and Emanuel Donchin at Illinois have successfully related different endogenous components in the ERP to different stages in the process of selective attention .  Suppose a subject is listening to different sequences of sounds played independently to each ear through a pair of headphones in order to pick out and respond to a particular target sound .  If the subject is instructed to attend to one ear and ignore the sounds coming into the other ear , all the sounds in the attended ear will <head>produce</head> an enhanced N100 component in the ERP . ( The name N100 indicates a systematically occurring negative shift in the ERP which peaks about 100 msec after the stimulus .  )  This enhancement is thought to be associated with the extraction of additional information about the stimuli in the attended ear .

Graphemic parsing is necessary because a phoneme is often represented in English by more than one letter  ( for example ,  PH represents one phoneme in graph ,  OO represents one phoneme in boot )  .

Finally , the phonemes are blended together to <head>produce</head> the spoken response . The alternative pronunciation route ,  which involves addressed phonology ,  employs the lexical system .

There is an equally important additional point that I want to make .  Since brain damage can <head>produce</head> these very precise differences between patients , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there is one part of the brain that has the precise function of carrying out each piece of information processing that is specified within the cognitive model . It seems to me to be perverse in the extreme to attempt to resist the claim that the brain is literally carrying out these functions .  Cognitive neuropsychology thus provides powerful evidence that the level of analysis which functionalists use to describe brain processes is the correct one .

Muller 's  nineteenth - century  doctrine of specific energies  formalized the ordinary observation that different sense organs are sensitive to different physical properties of the world and that when they are stimulated ,  sensations specific to those organs are experienced .  It was proposed that there are endings  ( or receptors )  within the nervous system which are attuned to specific types of energy ,  For example ,  retinal receptors in the eye respond to light energy ,  cochlear endings in the ear to vibrations in the air ,  and so on .  Of course , high energy stimulation even of the wrong kind may stimulate a sensory ending ; for example , excessive pressure on the eyeball will <head>produce</head> a sensation of light . Contrariwise ,  over - intense stimulation of the appropriate kind will evoke pain .  These are ,  however ,  abnormal situations ;  for ordinary perception ,  the doctrine of specific energies holds .

Intentionality is usually overlooked by causal theorists who tend to see their job as being to sort out the afferent limb .  It is therefore especially ironical that the neurophysiological CTP ,  which locates the basis of perception literally in the head ,  at a particular place away from the perceived object ,  actually sharpens the mystery of intentionality .  For nature , after all , offers no other examples of causal chains in which events causally downstream refer back to the objects that are involved in <head>producing</head> their causal ancestors . The intentionality of perceptions  and indeed of other mental phenomena  makes them non - analogous to material phenomena outside of the nervous system .  And nothing that takes place within the nervous system can explain why this property of intentionality should emerge there .

Desiccated liver This is perhaps one of the most widely used and cheapest of supplements in bodybuilding .  It is <head>produced</head> from raw beef liver , and once in its dried form is one of the most concentrated forms of food available . It has all the goodness of liver but with virtually all the moisture ,  fibre and fat taken out .  Desiccated liver is approximately 80 %  protein and is easily broken down and absorbed by the stomach .

It is the obliques and abdominals which create the well trained look .  Thus because there are stomach muscles which operate vertically ,  diagonally and horizontally ,  complex bending and twisting movements are possible ,  and support for the vital abdominal organs is provided .  One of the most popular myths in weight training is that higher reps <head>produce</head> bigger abdominals . However ,  in order for the abdominals to grow you must treat them like any other muscle group ,  and work them hard for 8 to 12 reps using 3 to 4 sets .  Two of the most basic exercises for increasing abdominal development are weighted sit - ups and weighted leg raises .

In only five of those factories were the levels on all machines below the maximum exposure level  ( MEL )  ,  stipulated by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health  ( COSHH )  laws .  Such was the ineffectiveness of controls that only 13 factories fell within a limit twice that of the MEL .  Although 60 per cent of the 363 samples taken were below the MEL , there were plenty of examples of poor control , with nearly two - thirds of all planers <head>producing</head> dust levels above the MEL . The HSE 's  Woodworking National Interest Group have concluded that lack of control is not the preserve of specific machines ,  and dust levels are high within factories as a whole .

The resulting shape is finally inserted into its background and the design mounted and finished as required .

Some manufacturers supply larger handles with larger tools ,  but I have not found any discomfort with this aspect of the design .

In my experience , there is only one manufacturer ( not British ) that <head>produces</head> tools ready for use for professional ornamental carving . Even in this case ,  some work needs doing to the back of the bevel to bring them to optimum usefulness .  The most pointed criticism is that the angle of the bevel is not rounded off or taken back far enough ,  so producing an elbow that hinders the smooth entry and flow of cut .

It is now a matter of history that  notwithstanding an outlay of 150million at current prices on research and development and prototype trains  the technical potential of the train was never achieved and in 1983 the entire project was abandoned .  Had BR had more time and more funding ,  had the government been more sympathetic towards the railway investment and had there been no recession ,  the APT might have eventually been successful  but that is another story .  ( By 1988 the Italian Railways had <head>produced</head> a tilting train the Pendolino which appears to be successful . ) Not only was the non - fulfilment of the APT an enormous financial loss but since its rapid adoption in squadron service had been presumed there were no alternative plans for either trains or track .  As the depression began to affect West Coast loadings it soon became clear that it was no longer possible to sustain the level of service provided in the 1974 Glasgow electric timetable .

WHO would have thought ,  back in 1980 ,  that we would now be reading in the popular railway magazines a number of reports that British Rail 's  Provincial sector possesses some routes which are promising to become profitable ?  Who indeed could have forecast that the Provincial sector would be announcing such an improvement in their financial situation resulting from rapid but targeted investment in new trains ,  with the prime objective of cost reduction ?  Certainly , only eight years ago , when the other sectors were given clearly defined briefs , the lumping of unprofitable passenger services into a somewhat negatively titled Other Provincial Services <head>produced</head> a kind of dustbin sector .

The same work was also required in a large number of the early Mark 2 locomotive - hauled carriages ,  and in many long - life electric multiple units .  It emerged that across the very varied fleets the cost of asbestos removal would be 25,000 per vehicle ,  an investment producing no financial return .  The question had to be asked : could the purchase of new trains <head>produce</head> savings sufficient to cover the cost of servicing their capital costs as well as reducing the burden on the PSO ? In the 1970s there were only two types of potential replacement DMU being considered by BR 's  passenger marketing people and the engineers .

It was intended as a high - performance set which could inherit the reliability associated with previous BR  ( SR )  DEMUs ,  thus beating the older ,  inherently unreliable diesel - mechanical multiple units hands down. Its problem ,  when analysed by the new Provincial sector was its price :  it would cost too much to enable a financial case to be made for the 210 breed to replace existing DMUs even taking asbestos removal into account .  The other design in the offing was the two - axle railbus which had started life as a Research Division project aimed at combining high - speed freightvehicle technology with that of the standard Leyland road bus in order to <head>produce</head> a low cost diesel train . This was certainly a cheap option ,  and there were some short -  or medium - distance routes where such a basic vehicle was considered acceptable .  In particular the PTEs in West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester were interested in the railbus as a replacement for their ageing DMUs .

No better example can be given than by citing the careers of Tamara Karsavina and Margot Fonteyn ,  both of whom worked with many different choreographers as well as submitting themselves to the severely classical discipline of the older Petipa repertoire .  A general view  There is a third type of choreographer who <head>produces</head> ballets which give audiences great pleasure through the sheer variety of their virtuoso designs . Because of the interesting ,  usually technical ,  demands made on the performers ,  their ballets often become testing grounds for future soloists .  Variations from such ballets as Petipa 's  Don Quixote ,  Raymonda  and La Bayadre  and Bournonville 's  Napoli  are still considered by most classical dancers to be more technically demanding than the more complex twistings and turnings of modern choreographers who mix their styles .

Today there are many ballets which are created in the generally accepted styles from which choreographers can borrow :  classical ,  demi - caractre  ,  romantic ,  character and/or national ,  and modern  ( see pages 75138 )  .  However ,  when necessary ,   choreographers can and should create a particular style that is perhaps based on a mixture of the above but that is ,  in the final analysis ,  a style suitable for one ballet only .  Such choreographers as Ashton , MacMillan and Robbins have <head>produced</head> some ballets which have an exclusive style of their own . The most outstanding are possibly Monotones ,  Gloria  and Afternoon of a Faun  .  Although the movements in all three are classically based ,  they would look out of place in older classical ballets or danced to other music .

Petipa divided movement into seven categories which other teachers have analysed further .  If these definitions were put through a computer they would list five kinds of jumps ,  twenty - three pas de bourre  ,  seven glissades  and so on .  The technical structure of each step and pose is known and years of practice in hundreds of class - rooms have <head>produced</head> principles of calm and - spacious movement . But technical descriptions only indicate the positions through which the feet and legs should move and at which moment they should co - ordinate with the arms as weight is transferred from one step and pose to the next .  There are few ,  if any ,  suggestions of how individual movements can be linked together to achieve some expressive or rhythmic quality suitable to the style of dance required by the plot ,  theme and/or music .

He explained the gestures in the libretto he prepared for his audience .  As a Greek and Latin scholar he had found them described in the works of ancient authors who wrote about the moods ,  emotions and actions of all the actors involved in their dramas .  By 1717 these gestures were accepted practice by actors to reinforce the meaning of the words spoken and particularly by members of the commedia dell'arte travelling troupes who <head>produced</head> mime plays . In these the expert gestures and extemporised playing of easily recognised characters in certain stock situations were understood by audiences everywhere no matter what the native language because the gestures were so explicit .  These gestures were first listed by monks in the tenth century .

The latter ,  after all ,  was the stereotype setting fur all classical ballet until 1789 ,  the year of the french Revolution .  La Fille Mal Garde  of 1789 was the first ballet to display the lives and loves of peasants and farmers .  Even the popularity of these lesser mortals could not drive aristocrats completely from the stage , particularly in those countries where major theatres continued to be subsidised by Royal Treasuries who largely dictated what choreographers could <head>produce</head> . The style of demi - caractre ballet The demi - caractre  style has its roots in classical technique ,  but must be coloured by more clearly defined and individual movements which allow the dancers to show they are playing the part of some character who has some claim to live in the real world and therefore can be recognised as such .

Keg ,  which includes lager ,  is known in the industry as brewery conditioned beer .  Instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to add a full ,  mature palate ,  keg beers are killed off in the brewery by filtration ,  chilling and pasteurisation .  The aim is to <head>produce</head> beers that are sterile , have a long shelf life and are highly profitable . In the case of keg milds and bitters when fermentation is complete they are conditioned for a short period under gas pressure and are then filtered to remove yeast solids and pasteurised .  As the beer cannot generate its own carbon dioxide it would be flat and lifeless so it is racked not into casks but into pressurised containers known as kegs .

The rest of the world drinks mainly lager beers and even in countries such as Belgium where ale - type beers are produced they come to fruition in the bottle rather than in the cask .

When the hopped wort has been cooled it is run to fermenting vessels where it meets its destiny with yeast .  The type of yeast strain used for ale is known as top fermenting .  It works at a warm temperature and vigorously turns the sugars in the wort into alcohol and carbon dioxide , <head>producing</head> at the same time ripe fruity aromas that add to the pleasure of ale drinking . The great head of yeast created during fermentation is cropped off and after a week the remaining yeast is overcome by the alcohol it has produced and sinks to the bottom of the fermenter .  The liquid is now officially called beer but it needs a few days further conditioning in the brewery ,  to purge some of the rough alcohols ,  before it is ready to leave for the pub .

The Anchor brewery had been built in 1757 by a couple of brewers from Bethnal Green called Wastfield and Moss ,  at a time when the district was so quiet and un - built - up you could still see ships passing on the Thames from the brewery windows .  John Charrington ,  the son of a Hertfordshire vicar ,  bought a third share in the brewery in 1766 ,  and by 1783 the Charrington family was in sole control .  Theirs was one of the few ale - only breweries in London at this time , most of the others <head>producing</head> huge amounts of porter for a voraciously thirsty market . Not until 1833 ,  when the Anchor brewery took over Steward and Head 's  brewery in neighbouring Stratford ,  did Charrington 's  start brewing porter and stout .

Flavours rapidly evaporate from hot wort while bitterness requires up to an hour to fully develop .  Brewers have been aware of this issue for centuries and have developed the practice of adding copper hops early in the boil to provide bitterness and aroma or late hops towards the end of the boil for flavour .  While whole hops are repeatedly claimed to <head>produce</head> the best hop character in a beer , problems may be encountered . First is the liability of hops to deterioration by oxygen in the air .  As might be expected this is accelerated by heat ,  making cold storage essential .

A range of these exist from simple compressed hop pellets to Pre - Isomerised Kettle Extracts ,  more affectionately known as PIKE .

The resulting pellets are termed Type 90 reflecting the high percentage of hop material present compared to water and foreign matters .  Enriched hop powder pellets are also possible by sieving the powder at  35C to remove coarser non a  acid material and by blending with liquid extracts to further enhance the a  acid content .

In its most basic form ,  it comprises a single straight nickel - iron alloy core carrying two windings .  One winding functions as an excitation coil in which current flowing creates a field to magnetise the core in alternate directions .  The other acts as a pickup coil <head>producing</head> a voltage proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linking it . At low levels of excitation this structure ,  outlined in Fig. 1 ,  will obviously behave as if it were an inefficient transformer .  To convert it to a fluxgate transducer ,  the excitation is increased so as to force the core into saturation on alternate peaks .

The pickup coil remains a single winding over the toroid  ( Fig. 8 )  .  By these modifications the sought - after simplicity is achieved ,  coupled with the virtual elimination of all high - level signals .  As an additional benefit , the closed magnetic circuit of a toroidal core greatly reduces the drive requirements to <head>produce</head> saturation levels , simplifying the circuitry need by the system . It may be felt that replacing two straight cores with a ring structure is too drastic a change to gloss over ,  but the mechanism is not too different in the two cases .  Figure 9 represents the way in which the lines of force are concentrated from the immediate vicinity and makes plausible the idea that an overwound coil would not see much difference in the flux changes it experiences from either system .

Figure 9 represents the way in which the lines of force are concentrated from the immediate vicinity and makes plausible the idea that an overwound coil would not see much difference in the flux changes it experiences from either system .  An additional advantage of the ring core is that it will accept more than one overwound pickup coil and they have different orientations to the external magnetic field .  For example while the coil orientation shown in Fig. 10a <head>produces</head> the largest output , that 10b links none of the changing flux and has a null output . Angles between these produce an output which varies as the cosine of the angle ,  leading to the familiar figure - of - eight polar diagram for directional sensitivity .  This is the characteristic which is exploited in the design of a fluxgate compass .

A gain of 400 in the first amplifier/filter will then produce an output of almost two and a half volts from the total earth 's  field vector ,  avoiding overload and permitting a peak - to - peak measurement by rotating the core .  Calibration The core is aligned with one coil picking up the north - south field and inclined at roughly 67 to the horizontal and adjusted so as to <head>produce</head> the largest positive output from the amplifier . It is then rotated through approximately 180 degrees to find the largest negative output .  This process is repeated ,  while the zero offset is adjusted ,  until the positive and negative readings have the same magnitude .

A magnetometer ,  detecting changes in the magnetic fields arising from charged particles deflected around the earth ,  measures the effects of corpuscular and non - corpuscular radiation emanated from the sun during solar flares and other events .  Non - corpuscular radiation is in the form of high energy X rays which ,  assuming that the earth is in the path of the rays ,  will reach the earth in fifteen minutes .  This radiation may increase the depth of the D layer due to ionisation and <head>produce</head> the all too well known Dellinger face out when long - distance HF communication ceases abruptly . Corpuscular or particulate radiation appears in the form of protons and neutrons which take longer to reach the earth 's  upper atmosphere than the higher energy radiations .  These nuclear particles arrive at the F1 and F2 layers approximately 48 hours following a solar event and produce ionisation by colliding with gaseous molecules and cosmic particles .

The rather woolly nature of these claims aside ,  readers might be forgiven for wondering why ,  if the Cuk converter offers so many desirable features ,  it is not more commonly used .

The low RF interference and low component count claims are usually made because the Cuk topology is not only able to accommodate the input and output filter chokes on the same magnetic core as the transformer ,  but it can also reduce the input and output ripple currents to very low levels .  This does indeed seem like getting something for nothing ,  but is it really ?  Since the input and output inductors store energy , then just like any other inductor , they <head>produce</head> flux in their common core and they require space for large enough diameter wire to keep I2R losses reasonable . Extra core volume and winding window area must be provided to support these .  What no one ,  as far as I know ,  has ever done is to show whether there is any space ,  weight ,  efficiency or cost saving that results from assembling all the windings onto one core .

In my view and also ,  if my memory serves me correctly ,  in Dr Reeves '  view ,  this is quite simply because it doubles up as a transmitter with very sharp rise and fall times on its pulse width modulated waveform .

In the light of W.

Clearly ,  the follow - up study was more favourable to the defenders of catholic schools than to opponents .  However , Greeley and Rossi 's work also has been used to uphold the defenders ' argument that , though Roman catholic schools varied in their efficiency , they were certainly better than any possible alternative in terms of <head>producing</head> good Roman catholics . Thus ,  both sides have tended to use social scientific research to make statements in general about catholic schools which have been drawn from other countries and ,  therefore ,  beyond the cultural confines within which Irish catholic schools exist .  This is something  for which surveys ,  including that of Greeley and Rossi ,  are not and cannot be intended .

Yeast is made up of millions of tiny fungus cells which literally go berserk when confronted by a liquid rich with sugars .  Within a few hours a scum appears on top of the wort and this rapidly builds up into a great yellowy - brown crust as the yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide .  The system used in Britain to <head>produce</head> mild , bitter , stout and strong ales is called warm fermentation , using a special type of top fermenting yeast . This means that the yeast ,  encouraged by the warmth of the wort and the temperature of the brewery ,  works quickly and vigorously on top of the wort to produce alcohol .  After 47 days most of the sugars have been turned into alcohol and the yeast begins to sink to the bottom of the vessel .

Where keg milds and bitters are concerned ,  when fermentation is complete they are conditioned for a short period in tanks under a heavy blanket of carbon dioxide .

Those that carry the same names as overseas beers are <head>produced</head> under licence and do not necessarily adhere to the recipe or strength of the original . The Whitbread version of Heineken ,  for example ,  is 12 degrees of gravity weaker than the Dutch version .  There is no such beer in Germany as Hofmeister ;  it is brewed here by Courage .

Beer is classified as a food stuff and yet it is excluded from the legal requirements to list ingredients .  Drinkers have a right to know whether the beer they are drinking is a genuine barley malt product or whether it is stuffed full of such tasty ingredients as corn syrup ,  propylene glycol alginate ,  amyloglucosidase ,  papain enzymes and potassium metabisulphite .  All these ingredients and additives were used to <head>produce</head> Miller Lite in the US until there was an outcry from consumers . In Britain ,  Courage brew Miller Lite under licence but do not have to reveal the ingredients .  Keg bitters and lager have been enormously successful for the brewers not as a result of genuine consumer demand but due to saturation advertising .

Many small independent breweries were saved from extinction .  Real ale became a major talking point in pubs and the media .  Slowly and hesitantly , the Big Six attempted to rebuild bridges to its alienated customers by <head>producing</head> and promoting cask conditioned beer again . When Allied Breweries unveiled Draught Burton Ale in 1976 to great acclaim ,  the flood gates opened and all the national combines hurried to embrace the new philosophy of abroad portfolio of brands to please the disparate wishes of pub users .

National ,  regional and local beer festivals present a vast range of beers to the public and help gain many new members .

Much of this is due to the face that ,  following the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on pub ownership ,  many breweries are actually moving out of brewing itself and concentrating instead on pub management  an area where they believe they stand to make the greatest profits .  At the end of the 80s the famous Manchester firm of Boddingtons sold its brewing operation to Whitbread ;  yet during 1988 alone ,  Claire Hunt has noted ,  Boddingtons undertook the refurbishment of 50 of their tied houses .  More recently , at the end of 1990 the regional brewing giant Greenall Whitley announced that it was closing both its breweries at Warrington and Nottingham ( formerly the independent Shipstone 's brewery ) to concentrate solely on running pubs contracting out its beer to be <head>produced</head> by former rivals Allied Breweries . The principal victims or beneficiaries of this change of direction are the historic tied houses .  And the principal problem facing them today is the replacement of genuine and much - loved historical features by bogus period fittings  which are invariably couched in a vaguely Victorian or Edwardian sham - historical style .

William Harrison noted in 1587 that :  In all our inns we have plenty of ale ,  beer and sundry kinds of wine and such is the capacity of some of these that they are able to lodge two hundred or three hundred persons and their horses .  In the medieval period the church was also involved in the brewing of its own church - ales , which were made on an occasional basis and <head>produced</head> a useful income supplement ; in late medieval times these were often served in the Church House that frequently adjoined the churchyard . The church - ales provided competition for the secular supply of beverages from the taverns and alehouses .  Both these establishments seem to have had an architectural form very similar to the ordinary domestic buildings of their area ,  and the hall provided the communal eating and drinking space .

The figures come from the latest study ,  Restaurant Chain Market in Europe  ,  compiled by GIRA SIC ,  a market research company affiliated to the Geneva International Research Associates group ,  which concentrates on service industries and catering .  For the study ,  a fast food outlet was defined as one with highly systemised operations ,  normally with counter service ,  and a high volume of customers .  Using these criteria GIRA SIC found that chains <head>produced</head> more than 70 % of the UK 's fast food meals in 1990 , with American groups dominating the market . Hamburger outlets are by far the most important ,  representing almost 80 %  of total turnover in the fast food market .  In the UK ,  franchising has always played a significant role ,  although relations between franchisor and franchisee have not always been smooth ,  according to the report .

Any standard piece of Western catering equipment simply cannot <head>produce</head> the heat needed . That 's  the crucial difference in keeping the flavour ,  says Jermey ,  for whom an important concern has been authenticity .

He was leaning against the rail smoking a cigarette and staring with an air of melancholy towards the distant island .

It was to her own surprise that Muriel Box ,  the director of 14 modest budget feature films between 1951 and 1964 ,  found herself an inspiration and a role model for a new generation of women film - makers ,  critics and students .  She was rediscovered as a film - maker in the early 80 's  ,  and a series of retrospectives and tributes culminated in 1990 at the International Festival of Women 's  Films in Creteil ,  where a programme of her work was feted by capacity audiences .  Her first husband was Sydney Box , the writer - director who became head of production at Gainsborough Studios ; and her sister - in - law was the Miss Box Office who <head>produced</head> the wildly successful DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE films over two decades . But Muriel 's  climb to film direction was slow and gradual ,  and she began her apprenticeship as a typist and then continuity girl ,  rising throughout the studio hierarchy .  She wrote theatre plays ,  often for all women casts ,  which anticipated her work on Gainsborough films ,  with their dominant roles for women stars and strong appeal to women audiences .

Many gardeners collect and store seeds from their garden plants ,  which is an economical practice ,  especially in the case of outstanding vegetables ,  flowering plants and sports or other unusual forms .  It is not really worth saving seeds from F1 hybrids or from most fruit varieties as these rarely reproduce true to type .  Variegated varieties will often <head>produce</head> green plants from seed , and seedlings from a flower mixture may not represent the full range of colours . You should gather seeds from the best plants only ,  if possible selecting and marking them early on and removing all but one or two of the first ,  fattest seed - heads to conserve as much energy as possible .  A plant left to fully ripen all its seeds will probably stop flowering or cropping before its neighbours .

For these reasons ,  when tackling the problem of gardening in the shade it is important to choose plants proficient at extracting energy from limited sunlight .  Mere tolerance of shade is not enough .  Some species may be receiving sufficient light to grow plenty of healthy foliage , but will always lack that little extra needed to <head>produce</head> flowering shoots . Variegated plants will start to make more chlorophyll in their leaves in response to restricted sunlight ,  and so tend to turn green in the shade .  Others need precise daily rations of sunlight that change with the seasons if they are to start flowering at a particular time .

Later ,  when the wind has picked up ,  the gliders weathercock round and can be free to tip over so that the into - wind wing is upwards .  Another hazard is the wind swinging and increasing during the day so that the glider ends up parked facing directly into the wind .  If the glider is facing across the wind with the into - wind wing held down , the wind will be blowing on to its top surface , <head>producing</head> an extra down - load . However ,  in a strong wind several tyres are required to stop the into - wind wing lifting up. The upper tip will be high in the air where the wind is stronger ,  while the lower wing will be close to the ground where the wind is much lighter .

It is a frightening experience ,  and I have never heard of anyone doing it a second time .  With a trailer that you have not towed before ,  your first priority should be to explore its stability carefully .  You can do this by driving on a quiet , wide road with no traffic about , gradually increasing your speed and moving the steering slightly to <head>produce</head> a very slight weave . As the speed is increased ,  the damping  becomes less and you will be able to decide on a reasonable limit to keep to for the first half hour .  By then you will have become tuned in to the driving and will be better able to judge if it is safe to go a little faster .

In flight ,  the directional or weathercock stability is maintained by the fin and rudder ,  which provide extra side area behind the c.g .  Thus with the aileron and rudder held in a central position ,  a glider will always weathercock into line with the relative airflow ,  just as the wind vane on a church steeple will always swing into the wind .  When rudder is applied , the nose of the glider yaws to the side until the force <head>produced</head> by the rudder is balanced by the tendency for the aircraft to swing back into line with the airflow . ( In the air this is nothing to do with the actual wind .  The aircraft is flying in a mass of air which may be stationary or moving .  )

In windy weather ,  the effects of the wind gradient near the ground accentuate any movement up or down of the towplane and glider .  If the towplane gains speed by flying close to the ground ,  when it noses up to start climbing ,  the effect of the wind gradient accentuates the climb so that the glider may easily be left flying close to the ground ,  in or near the wake and below the tug .  Then , when the glider pilot recognises he is far too low , any quick movement to regain position takes the glider up through the same wind gradient , causing a sudden surge of speed and <head>producing</head> an unexpected and possibly uncontrollable gain of height . At the same time ,  the extra load in the tow rope accentuates the nose - up pitching movement on the glider  ( as in a winch launch )  .  This slows down the towplane ,  leaving it at low speed below the glider and having its tail pulled up out of control .

Never having shown the same propensity as the French for violent revolution ,  the dispossessed have entered into a complex ritual of action within the processes of the criminal justice system ,  and in doing so have encouraged those tasked with their containment to consider them as being less than human and therefore needing further control and discipline .  As Wilson  ( 1981 )  ,  Reiner  ( 1985 )  ,  and others have clearly identified ,  policing is basically a socio - political tool of the state and government .  It is sustained by an intimate knowledge of its enemy the underclass of society and exemplary use is made of this knowledge to <head>produce</head> the technological and structural means for the continuity of this system of power . As we shall see ,  there is now a specifically created police culture of the dramatic ,  which incorporates illusion ,  praxis ,  and imagery as part of a well - directed social production .  It rejoices in an enhanced belief in Manichaean and mythological archetypes of good and evil which are made manifest in exaggerated games of cops and robbers .

Such a mood of concern has existed now for more than a decade and seems to mirror uncertainties of role occurring elsewhere in society .  For example ,  it can be argued the expansion into amalgamated police units has enlarged the organization to a point where it is no longer accessible to the man in the street ;  alternatively ,  it may be that the use of a centralized computer and complex technical aids has alienated the public even at the same time they are increasingly fed a diet of violent news snippets which reinforce a fear of crime and generate another folk devil of criminal menace ,  which demands the impossible :  a policeman on every corner .  In nightly theatrical TV rituals of social order and chaos , a stream of hero - policemen stand at the symbolic crossroads between peace and mayhem , and the detective and the chief officer now operate at the point where once the church and its priests declaimed on categories of good and evil and the resulting binary codes they <head>produce</head> . Inevitably ,  as a secular interpretation of morality has superseded that of established religion ,  so the  activities of the social controller have become increasingly important in the drama .  It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have remained the province of the archbishop and his clergy .

the report is certainly not a definitive and unchallengeable portrait of the Metropolitan police .  In later ,  calmer moments ,  those conclusions which are not based on published research material need to be contested .  There is a world of difference between research findings based on safe academic principles and methodology , and those <head>produced</head> with graphic literary phrases , but based upon anecdotal heresay , recorded by listeners blessed with total recall . This attack was repeated again in 1987 in the Federation magazine ,  for the report had obviously hit a very raw nerve .  Its frenzied rejection was very different to that of the many projects listed in the Police Foundation or Home Office Registers of Research mentioned above ,  most of which are simply ignored and never ever receive any review .

Nor will he be able to take a sabbatical to formulate the complex structures of meaning lodged deep in the empirical material ,  which Lvi - Strauss  ( 1976 :  80 )  has argued are capable of linking together symbolic and metaphoric programmes to reveal properties not immediately accessible to the  ( empirical )  observation .  To coin another military metaphor ,  he must soldier on knowing that all of this activity might well smack of sedition .  Even the fact that someone inside is writing fieldnotes will <head>produce</head> unease , as I have experienced ; and their collation can almost certainly be tantamount to something akin to espionage ; for as Sean Conlin ( 1980 ) observed : often our work can seem political rather than scientific .

Furthermore ,  as these college - based insiders stress ,  their essays do not represent police college views or those of the Home Office ;  and both Thackrah  ( 1985 )  and his publisher ,  James Tindall ,  take pains to ensure from the outset that we are aware than any views expressed in the book are those of individual contributors ,  and not those of the college ,  the Home Office ,  or even the police service .  One might suggest then that the major project Holdaway recognized was missing from the college inventory is still to come !  Indeed the anonymous reviewer of the Pope and Weiner edition went on to propose that if the police staff college is to fulfil its task of <head>producing</head> a major project with any credibility , it must encourage its academic staff to go out into the field to study policing at first hand . Other challenges to social researchers to pursue a form of participant observation are to be occasionally found in the journals :  questions were being raised about what the police were doing ,  what they ought to be doing and how they ought to be organised and accountable .

He dismissed this as irrelevant and his use of metaphor ,  in what  turned out to be an eighty - minute interview ,  was most revealing .  I later recorded he invariably used the idea of an escape from real work to describe any research secondment ;  in doing so he embodied the common institutional fear of uncontrolled social movement across a divide or boundary into another society such as academia .  This is part of the ideological pedagogy which the institution uses to create and maintain defensive boundaries against the outsider or those who might <head>produce</head> a critical analysis of its systems ; it is one major strength of the organization . Again ,  as I recorded in a fieldnote ,  this assistant chief exhibited aspects of what I could only then describe as institutional paranoia ,  when he went on to deride an unnamed social scientist who had been allowed research facilities inside a police force  ( unspecified )  .  He dismissively described how this man had come in ,  taken the material provided ,  and then had written a childish and critical book on the police ,  out of which he got a Ph.D .

To have advanced within the job and achieved rank means he is likely to have followed and supported institutional precedents without question ,  and to have unwittingly accepted and been involved in the reproduction of the narrow modes of thought and practice demanded by the culture .  It is this special knowledge ,  or gnosis ,  which hopefully can make the inside ethnography so different and illuminating .  Burridge ( 1969 ) has written most persuasively about the effects which fieldwork can have on the anthropologist , describing the prophetic experience this can <head>produce</head> . He links this to the act of consciousness raising ,  which I consider presents the greatest problem for the insider who cannot leave the field or return to academia .  The insider/ethnographer can turn his understanding of an interpretive methodology to an assessment of his own actions ,  and see connections as if scales had been removed from his eyes .

By consciously using subjectivity as a research tool ,  the insider is peculiarly placed to generate what Geertz  ( 1976 )  described as an inward conceptual rhythm ,  moving between the particular and the general .  Hopefully ,  he can use the creativity which exists between the experiential inside view and observational outside view of a cultural system to formulate an ethnography which incorporates a continuous dialectical ,  tacking between the most local of detail and the most global of global structures in such a  way as to bring them into simultaneous view  ( Geertz ibid .  235 )  .  But it is not just how the new consciousness is to be used which <head>produces</head> problems in handling this new - found wisdom ; it is the very acquisition of knowledge itself which makes the concept of self so dynamic . This structural awareness can be as hard to handle as any decision to try to publish the account ,  for what has happened in the past and what is expected now from the insider is tied up with an understanding of how the institution of policing prefers to present a restricted image for outside consumption ,  as I have described above .  It all becomes uncomfortably apparent and that which had been lived and accepted is opened up in a revelatory manner ,  so that the vice of being caught up within the hegemonies of such a system designed to control a powerless underclass can become overbearing .

Once the semantics of police experience were revealed ,  I had to live with the problems experienced by both Castenada and Favret - Saada ,  although I demur from casting myself into their intellectual companionship .  Reality itself then became a construct of knowing and being known ,  and of living with the alternative possibility .  For personal transitions made across physical and psychic boundaries during the subjectivity of the field situation can <head>produce</head> disjunction ; indeed they can paralyse . In such a situation it is therefore all the more necessary to recognize the unique place the ethnographer holds and to capitalize on it .  During this time of subjective observing participation ,   the policeman/insider moves to the margins ,  to a point where analysis negates automatic approval or predisposition for a world of known categories and classifications .

By  defining  this insider fieldwork  ( and the university experience which generated it )  as a liminal situation ,  I am extending the Turnerian concept  ( 1969 ,  1974 )  in which the individual moves temporarily into an unstructured and somewhat ambiguous state ,  during the initial process of passing through a rite de passage  before returning to structure .  Here the marginality is less transitory and occurs in the post - tribal situation where the concept of liminality is less familiar to the discipline ,  even though transitions across spatial and temporal boundaries still create epistemological changes of the kind Turner describes .  In my own case , the model of transition through liminality might still <head>produce</head> a recognizable replication of the move through a rite de passage : policeman  student  new policeman But there seems more to it than that !

I suspect it is no  accident the politics of the times seems to parallel the growing toughness of the police image ,  or that the police have taken on an increasing resemblance to the black - clothed enemies of goodness who sprinkle the popular science fantasy films such as Star Wars ,  Superman  ,  and the like .  In these mass cultural replays of the eternal dichotomy between good and evil ,  the use of highly symbolic black uniforms as an indicator of anonymous evil predominates .  Within the separate police forces , the nuances of uniform difference were always embroidered by real polises to <head>produce</head> symbolic boundaries from which to assess other uniform wearers . Thus our contacts with firemen ,  St John Ambulance men ,  special constables ,  and the like were all used to define them as being somewhat unreal and therefore slightly less than human .  Such groups were said to be like the foreigners in the adjacent forces ,  for it was constantly repeated that many wanted to join us but failed because of some inadequacy .

This undermined any pre - ordained police logic we might have employed to define them , so that pressures to <head>produce</head> a unidimensional model of polis prig were simply unable to be maintained , although we did home in on such facets as their long hair and frequently unwashed state to polarize them as binary animals , in contrast to our human status . And so although they were still the opposition ,  they could rarely be classified as real prigs .  We therefore became aberrant policemen simply because what we were now living was not programmed by previous organizational knowledge and habit .

When this picture was fully developed ,  even space was represented not as being qualitatively the way it is in vision ,  but as a structural isomorph of visual and tactile space .  By this point ,  every knowable quality was confined to the mind .  But the modern behaviourist and functionalist analyses of mind treat mental states as mere powers to <head>produce</head> behaviour : that is , they abolish the intrinsic qualitative content of mental states , replacing it by causal , hence relational , properties . We have then reached the absurd position that nothing in the world possesses a knowable intrinsic or qualitative nature ,  for all properties are essentially relational .  This predicament arises out of the demise of consciousness ,  when only consciousness ,  understood in a traditional way ,  can bring us face to face with ,  and hence give us any grasp on ,  the qualitative ,  as opposed to relational ,  properties .

Paradoxically ,  associationism is anathema  to representational theorists like Fodor ;  and Fodor criticizes connectionism  ( see Chapter 7 )  for inheriting all the problems of associationism .  But a picture of the mind as consisting of atomic mental states causally interacting is not a million miles from the Humean view  a view of which Hume himself was the most insightful critic .  On a more phenomenological level , if we wanted some visual analogue to the associationist view of mental life we could not do much better than think of one of those psychedelic slide - shows popular in the late 1960s , in which lights were projected through oil , <head>producing</head> coloured globs which met , merged and repelled in a series of kaleidoscopic patterns . Every emerging pattern was explicable in terms of principles of local association .  From the standpoint of constructivism ,  the reason why associationist - representational theories so spectacularly fail to capture the essence of thought is that they ignore the fact that every thought ,  like every action ,  has ,  at some level ,  a purpose .

Nevertheless ,  they have demonstrated activity in the visual areas during an imaging task ,  in the language areas during a verbal task and even ,  on one  -  occasion ,  in the higher visual areas of a schizophrenic patient who subsequently reported that he had been hallucinating .  Remarkable as these observations are ,  they are currently only confirming what was known already about localization within the brain .

We have no way of knowing exactly when these experiences took place .  All we can reasonably conclude is that they happened at the same time .  A much more likely explanation of Libet 's findings is simply that all experiences are delayed relative to the stimulus causing them , so that synchronous external events <head>produce</head> synchronous experiences . ( Another useful illusion is that of the instantaneity of experience .  We have to view a stimulus for a finite time before it generates a perception ,  but that perception appears to us to occur instantaneously rather than fading into view like the Cheshire cat .  )

Recent experiments on the psychophysiology of selective attention by ,  for example ,  Steven Hillyard at San Diego and Emanuel Donchin at Illinois have successfully related different endogenous components in the ERP to different stages in the process of selective attention .  Suppose a subject is listening to different sequences of sounds played independently to each ear through a pair of headphones in order to pick out and respond to a particular target sound .  If the subject is instructed to attend to one ear and ignore the sounds coming into the other ear , all the sounds in the attended ear will <head>produce</head> an enhanced N100 component in the ERP . ( The name N100 indicates a systematically occurring negative shift in the ERP which peaks about 100 msec after the stimulus .  )  This enhancement is thought to be associated with the extraction of additional information about the stimuli in the attended ear .

Graphemic parsing is necessary because a phoneme is often represented in English by more than one letter  ( for example ,  PH represents one phoneme in graph ,  OO represents one phoneme in boot )  .  Each grapheme is then translated into a corresponding phonemic representation on the basis of pre - established conversion rules  ( each grapheme would become associated with a particular phoneme as one 's  reading skills develop )  .  Finally , the phonemes are blended together to <head>produce</head> the spoken response . The alternative pronunciation route ,  which involves addressed phonology ,  employs the lexical system .  Initially ,  an entry in a reading lexicon which matches the sequence of letters that one has detected is located .

I have gone into such detail about individual patients to try to convince you first ,  that it can be misleading to categorize patients too narrowly into groups ,  and second ,  that the dual - route model I described can accommodate a wide variety of data from different individual cases .  There is an equally important additional point that I want to make .  Since brain damage can <head>produce</head> these very precise differences between patients , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there is one part of the brain that has the precise function of carrying out each piece of information processing that is specified within the cognitive model . It seems to me to be perverse in the extreme to attempt to resist the claim that the brain is literally carrying out these functions .  Cognitive neuropsychology thus provides powerful evidence that the level of analysis which functionalists use to describe brain processes is the correct one .

Muller 's  nineteenth - century  doctrine of specific energies  formalized the ordinary observation that different sense organs are sensitive to different physical properties of the world and that when they are stimulated ,  sensations specific to those organs are experienced .  It was proposed that there are endings  ( or receptors )  within the nervous system which are attuned to specific types of energy ,  For example ,  retinal receptors in the eye respond to light energy ,  cochlear endings in the ear to vibrations in the air ,  and so on .  Of course , high energy stimulation even of the wrong kind may stimulate a sensory ending ; for example , excessive pressure on the eyeball will <head>produce</head> a sensation of light . Contrariwise ,  over - intense stimulation of the appropriate kind will evoke pain .  These are ,  however ,  abnormal situations ;  for ordinary perception ,  the doctrine of specific energies holds .

Intentionality is usually overlooked by causal theorists who tend to see their job as being to sort out the afferent limb .  It is therefore especially ironical that the neurophysiological CTP ,  which locates the basis of perception literally in the head ,  at a particular place away from the perceived object ,  actually sharpens the mystery of intentionality .  For nature , after all , offers no other examples of causal chains in which events causally downstream refer back to the objects that are involved in <head>producing</head> their causal ancestors . The intentionality of perceptions  and indeed of other mental phenomena  makes them non - analogous to material phenomena outside of the nervous system .  And nothing that takes place within the nervous system can explain why this property of intentionality should emerge there .

Slightly shorter in length ,  and with a 90sq in headsize rather than the 95 and 105 which are currently the norm ,  the Challenge 26 is also lighter and specially balanced to suit female and junior players .  It features a highly aerodynamic wide - body graphite frame for easy manoeuvrability and greater power and includes Slazenger 's  Optimum Mass System at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions on the frame to extend the sweet spot and so improve playability and ball control .

MEMORIES OF THE 1950s CHAIRMAN Sir Peter Parker was doing his best ,  but the 1980s opened with much the same worries of insecurity over government policy ,  lack of investment ,  and working practices which harked back to the old company rules .  Although the new chairman Sir Robert Reid had his critics , at the decade 's end it was clear that his method of management had <head>produced</head> decisive changes . A slimmer BR was more confident ,  easier to contemplate privatising .  There was no longer just the promise of investment ,  but much of it in place .

It is now a matter of history that  notwithstanding an outlay of 150million at current prices on research and development and prototype trains  the technical potential of the train was never achieved and in 1983 the entire project was abandoned .  Had BR had more time and more funding ,  had the government been more sympathetic towards the railway investment and had there been no recession ,  the APT might have eventually been successful  but that is another story .  ( By 1988 the Italian Railways had <head>produced</head> a tilting train the Pendolino which appears to be successful . ) Not only was the non - fulfilment of the APT an enormous financial loss but since its rapid adoption in squadron service had been presumed there were no alternative plans for either trains or track .  As the depression began to affect West Coast loadings it soon became clear that it was no longer possible to sustain the level of service provided in the 1974 Glasgow electric timetable .

WHO would have thought ,  back in 1980 ,  that we would now be reading in the popular railway magazines a number of reports that British Rail 's  Provincial sector possesses some routes which are promising to become profitable ?  Who indeed could have forecast that the Provincial sector would be announcing such an improvement in their financial situation resulting from rapid but targeted investment in new trains ,  with the prime objective of cost reduction ?  Certainly , only eight years ago , when the other sectors were given clearly defined briefs , the lumping of unprofitable passenger services into a somewhat negatively titled Other Provincial Services <head>produced</head> a kind of dustbin sector .

The same work was also required in a large number of the early Mark 2 locomotive - hauled carriages ,  and in many long - life electric multiple units .

In the 1970s there were only two types of potential replacement DMU being considered by BR 's  passenger marketing people and the engineers .

It was intended as a high - performance set which could inherit the reliability associated with previous BR  ( SR )  DEMUs ,  thus beating the older ,  inherently unreliable diesel - mechanical multiple units hands down. Its problem ,  when analysed by the new Provincial sector was its price :  it would cost too much to enable a financial case to be made for the 210 breed to replace existing DMUs even taking asbestos removal into account .  The other design in the offing was the two - axle railbus which had started life as a Research Division project aimed at combining high - speed freightvehicle technology with that of the standard Leyland road bus in order to <head>produce</head> a low cost diesel train . This was certainly a cheap option ,  and there were some short -  or medium - distance routes where such a basic vehicle was considered acceptable .

No better example can be given than by citing the careers of Tamara Karsavina and Margot Fonteyn ,  both of whom worked with many different choreographers as well as submitting themselves to the severely classical discipline of the older Petipa repertoire .  A general view  There is a third type of choreographer who <head>produces</head> ballets which give audiences great pleasure through the sheer variety of their virtuoso designs . Because of the interesting ,  usually technical ,  demands made on the performers ,  their ballets often become testing grounds for future soloists .  Variations from such ballets as Petipa 's  Don Quixote ,  Raymonda  and La Bayadre  and Bournonville 's  Napoli  are still considered by most classical dancers to be more technically demanding than the more complex twistings and turnings of modern choreographers who mix their styles .

Today there are many ballets which are created in the generally accepted styles from which choreographers can borrow :  classical ,  demi - caractre  ,  romantic ,  character and/or national ,  and modern  ( see pages 75138 )  .  However ,  when necessary ,   choreographers can and should create a particular style that is perhaps based on a mixture of the above but that is ,  in the final analysis ,  a style suitable for one ballet only .  Such choreographers as Ashton , MacMillan and Robbins have <head>produced</head> some ballets which have an exclusive style of their own . The most outstanding are possibly Monotones ,  Gloria  and Afternoon of a Faun  .  Although the movements in all three are classically based ,  they would look out of place in older classical ballets or danced to other music .

Petipa divided movement into seven categories which other teachers have analysed further .  If these definitions were put through a computer they would list five kinds of jumps ,  twenty - three pas de bourre  ,  seven glissades  and so on .  The technical structure of each step and pose is known and years of practice in hundreds of class - rooms have <head>produced</head> principles of calm and - spacious movement . But technical descriptions only indicate the positions through which the feet and legs should move and at which moment they should co - ordinate with the arms as weight is transferred from one step and pose to the next .  There are few ,  if any ,  suggestions of how individual movements can be linked together to achieve some expressive or rhythmic quality suitable to the style of dance required by the plot ,  theme and/or music .

La Fille Mal Garde  of 1789 was the first ballet to display the lives and loves of peasants and farmers .

Keg ,  which includes lager ,  is known in the industry as brewery conditioned beer .

The aim is to <head>produce</head> beers that are sterile , have a long shelf life and are highly profitable . In the case of keg milds and bitters when fermentation is complete they are conditioned for a short period under gas pressure and are then filtered to remove yeast solids and pasteurised .  As the beer cannot generate its own carbon dioxide it would be flat and lifeless so it is racked not into casks but into pressurised containers known as kegs .

When the hopped wort has been cooled it is run to fermenting vessels where it meets its destiny with yeast .  The type of yeast strain used for ale is known as top fermenting .  It works at a warm temperature and vigorously turns the sugars in the wort into alcohol and carbon dioxide , <head>producing</head> at the same time ripe fruity aromas that add to the pleasure of ale drinking . The great head of yeast created during fermentation is cropped off and after a week the remaining yeast is overcome by the alcohol it has produced and sinks to the bottom of the fermenter .

Flavours rapidly evaporate from hot wort while bitterness requires up to an hour to fully develop .

While whole hops are repeatedly claimed to <head>produce</head> the best hop character in a beer , problems may be encountered . First is the liability of hops to deterioration by oxygen in the air .  As might be expected this is accelerated by heat ,  making cold storage essential .

A range of these exist from simple compressed hop pellets to Pre - Isomerised Kettle Extracts ,  more affectionately known as PIKE .  Compressed hops have a number of advantages ,  including reduced liability for oxidation ,  reduced storage volume and ease of handling .  An extension to simple compression is to crush the hops and pelletise the powder <head>produced</head> . The resulting pellets are termed Type 90 reflecting the high percentage of hop material present compared to water and foreign matters .  Enriched hop powder pellets are also possible by sieving the powder at  35C to remove coarser non a  acid material and by blending with liquid extracts to further enhance the a  acid content .

Ordinary polythene netting will deteriorate within two or three seasons ,  but manufacturers usually add a uv stabiliser ,  which considerably extends its useful life .

In its most basic form ,  it comprises a single straight nickel - iron alloy core carrying two windings .  One winding functions as an excitation coil in which current flowing creates a field to magnetise the core in alternate directions .  The other acts as a pickup coil <head>producing</head> a voltage proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linking it . At low levels of excitation this structure ,  outlined in Fig. 1 ,  will obviously behave as if it were an inefficient transformer .  To convert it to a fluxgate transducer ,  the excitation is increased so as to force the core into saturation on alternate peaks .

The pickup coil remains a single winding over the toroid  ( Fig. 8 )  .  By these modifications the sought - after simplicity is achieved ,  coupled with the virtual elimination of all high - level signals .  As an additional benefit , the closed magnetic circuit of a toroidal core greatly reduces the drive requirements to <head>produce</head> saturation levels , simplifying the circuitry need by the system . It may be felt that replacing two straight cores with a ring structure is too drastic a change to gloss over ,  but the mechanism is not too different in the two cases .  Figure 9 represents the way in which the lines of force are concentrated from the immediate vicinity and makes plausible the idea that an overwound coil would not see much difference in the flux changes it experiences from either system .

Figure 9 represents the way in which the lines of force are concentrated from the immediate vicinity and makes plausible the idea that an overwound coil would not see much difference in the flux changes it experiences from either system .  An additional advantage of the ring core is that it will accept more than one overwound pickup coil and they have different orientations to the external magnetic field .  For example while the coil orientation shown in Fig. 10a <head>produces</head> the largest output , that 10b links none of the changing flux and has a null output . Angles between these produce an output which varies as the cosine of the angle ,  leading to the familiar figure - of - eight polar diagram for directional sensitivity .  This is the characteristic which is exploited in the design of a fluxgate compass .

It is then rotated through approximately 180 degrees to find the largest negative output .

A magnetometer ,  detecting changes in the magnetic fields arising from charged particles deflected around the earth ,  measures the effects of corpuscular and non - corpuscular radiation emanated from the sun during solar flares and other events .  Non - corpuscular radiation is in the form of high energy X rays which ,  assuming that the earth is in the path of the rays ,  will reach the earth in fifteen minutes .  This radiation may increase the depth of the D layer due to ionisation and <head>produce</head> the all too well known Dellinger face out when long - distance HF communication ceases abruptly . Corpuscular or particulate radiation appears in the form of protons and neutrons which take longer to reach the earth 's  upper atmosphere than the higher energy radiations .  These nuclear particles arrive at the F1 and F2 layers approximately 48 hours following a solar event and produce ionisation by colliding with gaseous molecules and cosmic particles .

Cuk vs. Buck According to Terrence Finnegan , the Cuk power converter offers the best of all power supply worlds , approaches 90 % efficiency , requires few components , and <head>produces</head> minimal amounts of interference ( EW + WW July 1991 ) . The rather woolly nature of these claims aside ,  readers might be forgiven for wondering why ,  if the Cuk converter offers so many desirable features ,  it is not more commonly used .  The fact is that in the world of switch - mode power supplies  ( and it is a very large world indeed ,  covering PCB ,  mainframe computers ,  electronic telephone exchanges ,  military equipment ,  aerospace ,  and more besides )  it is rare to come across a Cuk converter .

The low RF interference and low component count claims are usually made because the Cuk topology is not only able to accommodate the input and output filter chokes on the same magnetic core as the transformer ,  but it can also reduce the input and output ripple currents to very low levels .  This does indeed seem like getting something for nothing ,  but is it really ?  Since the input and output inductors store energy , then just like any other inductor , they <head>produce</head> flux in their common core and they require space for large enough diameter wire to keep I2R losses reasonable . Extra core volume and winding window area must be provided to support these .  What no one ,  as far as I know ,  has ever done is to show whether there is any space ,  weight ,  efficiency or cost saving that results from assembling all the windings onto one core .

In my view and also ,  if my memory serves me correctly ,  in Dr Reeves '  view ,  this is quite simply because it doubles up as a transmitter with very sharp rise and fall times on its pulse width modulated waveform .

I fully accept that in Andy Gothard 's article ( EW + WW July 1991 ) about King 's College , there is a circuit system developed by Dr Mark Sandler which <head>produces</head> a very accurate , and indeed ideal , analogue output from the digital ( CD ) to analogue ( PWM power amplifier drive ) converter .
