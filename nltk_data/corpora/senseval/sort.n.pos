There is no outside view of any <head>sort</head> and the only time they leave the cell is for weekend visits from relatives , bi - daily showers or for 45 minutes ' daily exercise .

Our American friend 's  cousin in London is an art student .  Her college library has interesting books ,  as well as the latest art magazines .  Her course teacher has given her a reading list , and the library staff are good at helping students with all <head>sorts</head> of interests . As part of the course ,  she has to choose a subject of her own about which to write a paper ;  one of her difficulties is to know how to form her own views ,  not just copy already received opinions .  She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ;  it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic ,  since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome ,  and although there were plenty of books about it ,  many of them went into extravagant detail .

Things are not so simple ,  as some art historians write well about the present ,  with a generosity of feeling and approach enriching to contemporary culture .  They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,  partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro , who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art , was an open - minded historian of this <head>sort</head> . He wrote enthusiastically about the later work of Arshile Gorky :  Gorky 's  atmosphere ,  veiling the hard opaque wall of the canvas ,  evokes a nocturnal void or the vague ,  unstable image - space of the day - dreaming mind .

Indeed ,  there are some who feel that there should be no border ,  thinking back nostalgically to days when there was only one domain of art .  In some writing today ,  too ,  it is possible to find the words critic and historian being used interchangeably .  Art is after all the subject of attention for both critic and historian , even though the functions and methods of the two <head>sorts</head> of writer have drawn apart . Fifty years ago they were in closer touch .  It was in 1936 that the first American edition of Lionello Venturi 's  History of Art Criticism  was published ,  containing material which could equally have found a place in a book about art history .

A guide to art reference books published in 1969 had 2,500 entries ,  some of which referred to series ;  for example ,  there was a single entry for the series of monographs on individual artists ,  called Klassiker der Kunst  ,  also published in French as Classiques d'Art  ,  in which there are thirty - eight books .  This guide was extensively revised over nine  years ,  and was republished in 1980 as a Guide to the Literature of Art  History ,  intended for persons doing serious research in the field of art history .  Another <head>sort</head> of writing about art is what artists themselves have written , either about their own work or about other artists . This may be by way of theory ,  or on more matter - of - fact lines about technique or such questions as composition .  Some writing by artists takes the form of instruction ;  in every period manuals on how to do it ,  whether drawing ,  making sculpture or other technical tasks are found ,  though their incidence is irregular ,  and such treatises are often the work of minor artists ,  rather than the great ;  Leonardo is an exception .

There is no need to be intimidated by the formality of a staid institution 's  catalogue ,  or to neglect popular magazines ;  as for writing in various academic disciplines ,  there ought to be no barrier to learning about an interesting topic .

Academies of art ,  whether in the West or in the Orient ,  have had lists of priorities in themes of art ,  in which there are many similarities .  For example ,  in twelfth - century China ,  a catalogue of the Imperial collection had ten headings :  Taoist and Buddhist subjects ,  human affairs ,  palaces and other buildings ,  foreign tribes ,  dragons and fishes ,  landscapes ,  animals ,  flowers and birds ,  ink bamboos ,  and finally vegetables and fruit .  This <head>sort</head> of listing is worth knowing by a reader , who may occasionally notice that it underlies the degree of attention being paid to a theme by a critic .

A first broad division between types of exhibitions needs to be made .  There are shows which could be grouped under the heading of historical exhibitions ;  there are mixed exhibitions and group exhibitions of works by living artists ;  and there are exhibitions in dealers '  galleries ,  notably solo shows .  The catalogues which accompany these events have rather different characters , for although there are entries for the exhibited works in each <head>sort</head> of catalogue , and usually an introduction , historical catalogues often have additional essays . Catalogues of major shows have also become bigger and more expensive in recent years ,  usually through the help of national ,  industrial or commercial sponsorship .  A characteristic historical exhibition may be called something like The Age of Rembrandt ,  or Shock of Recognition ;  the landscape of English Romanticism and the Dutch seventeenth - century school ;  both of these are actual titles .

An example is the catalogue of paintings by Nol Coward ,  which was prefaced by a memoir of the playwright ,  describing his interest in painting .

It would be wrong to dismiss this <head>sort</head> of criticism as mere sales talk , particularly in grand auctioneers ' catalogues , though there is little danger of such publications being reticent . Part of the charm of a sale is that the financial result is in itself a sort of critical judgement ,  reflecting even if not defining the taste and mood of the moment .  But an auction is mainly a bullish market ;  vendors are trying to improve their prices ,  and few except dealers are selling on the market 's  way down ,  in order to rebuy .

The quotation is from an article of 1954 ,  at a time when Picasso 's  reputation was very high .  Heron was anxious to point out Braque 's  qualities ,  so he trailed his coat openly .   To suggest , as I do , that Georges Braque is the greatest living painter is to remind a contemporary audience , fed to satiety on brilliant innovation , frenzied novelty and every <head>sort</head> of spontaneous expression , that , after all , permanence , grandeur , deliberation , lucidity and calm are paramount virtues of the art of painting The rival genius of Picasso has proved to the world that our age may be epitomized by works which  ( show )  his unfailing sense of visual drama ,  his protean invention and his power of investing his creations with a hallucinatory poetry .  Heron shows in his article a deep sympathy with Braque 's  work ,  which ,  incidentally ,  was a sort of painting he himself was seeking to practise at the time .

The most common <head>sort</head> of mixed exhibition is the exhibiting society , whose history is entwined with the development of art in Europe since the eighteenth century . The shows put on in Paris at the Salon ,  and in London at the Royal Academy ,  were a means of creating sales for artists at a turning point in the history of patronage ;  as there developed a middle - class market for literature ,  so there developed a comparable market for art .

A cynic will remember that research into the opinion - forming powers of newspapers has tended  to conclude that readers expect to have their existing views confirmed .  If so ,  the power of critics may be no more than the listings services offered in the papers or on posters ,  while real power can be found in the organisation of the art market .  A different <head>sort</head> of exhibition which has had some success in attracting attention , and thus newspaper coverage , is the prize competition . Here the critic is absolved from making judgements of his own by the need to report what a jury has decided about prizes .  The critic 's  standing is thereby reduced ,  and the description or evaluation of the prize works is less than likely to be uninfluenced by their new position .

The arguments put forward can be interesting in themselves ,  but their drift is often towards making the context of the art shown more understandable .  Art politics or cultural history are favourite themes for such reviewers ,  apart from the spectrum of cognate disciplines which may be the specialities of writers who are only occasionally concerned with art .  Thematic articles are likely to be found in two <head>sorts</head> of periodicals , general magazines and academic journals , either interdisciplinary or of specialist disciplines . Valuable interpretive ideas may be found in journals of psychology ,  aesthetics ,  philosophy ,  history ,  religion ,  sociology ,  anthropology ,  even medicine and biology ,  although these may not be matched up with descriptions and evaluations of art .  Such articles may not start with art ;  as Rudolf Arnheim said about his book ,  Art and Visual Perception  ,  he applied principles of visual perception to examples taken from the arts .

One aspect of illusion is perspective ,  much valued in the Western tradition .  Three <head>sorts</head> of perspective are identified by Leonardo da Vinci in his treatise on painting , as follows : The first deals with the reasons of the  ( apparent )  diminution of objects as they recede from the eye ,  and is known as Perspective of Diminution :  the second contains the way colours vary as they recede from the eye :  the third and last explains how objects should appear less distinct in proportion as they are more remote .  And the names are as follows :  Linear perspective ,  the perspective of colour ,  the perspective of disappearance .

Paolo Uccello would have been the most delightful and imaginative genius since Giotto that had adorned the art of painting ,  if he had devoted as much pains to figures and animals as he did to questions of perspective ,  for ,  although these are ingenious and good in their way ,  yet an immoderate devotion to them causes an infinite waste of  time ,  fatigues nature ,  clogs the mind with difficulties ,  and frequently renders it sterile where it had previously been fertile and facile .  But when Uccello died in his eighties ,  He left a daughter who could design ,  and a wife who used to say that Paolo would remain the night long in his study to work out the lines of his perspective ,  and that when she called him to come to rest ,  he replied ,  Oh what a sweet thing this perspective is !  Mathematical perspective of a Renaissance <head>sort</head> had not been used in European medieval art , where the size of a figure often derives from the person 's importance , God the father never being small . A perspective may be used which reverses the convergence of lines in the distance ;  instead ,  lines of perspective converge in front of the viewer ,  an unexpected phenomenon for a twentieth - century spectator used to photographs .  Again ,  in Chinese art perspective is different from its treatment in the West .

Yet such a comment may need to be made ,  nevertheless ,  to point out the quality of a picture .  The critic who pays little notice to perspective or other means of representing the natural world will deprive a reader of help in enjoying the exceptional beauty of the natural appearance of Impressionist pictures ,  whose qualities are inspired by scientific understanding of light and its effects .  In a different <head>sort</head> of context , what appears to be an abstract design , devoid of reference to the natural world , may in fact be a stylisation of a person , an animal or an imagined figure . The totems of American Indians ,  the carvings of Inouk ,  ancient bronze ritual vessels from China ,  and many more examples can be found through the world and the centuries .  Most African sculpture is not in this category ,  as characteristically the masks and ritual objects of Africa are more evidently human or animal in appearance .

Are they able to look without too dominant a preconception coming from the Western tradition ?  There are amusing archaeological records in the nineteenth century of the inability of even trained artists to record what they saw ;  Assyrian figure sculptures ,  for example ,  were recorded as having unmistakably classical Greek features by an artist in the employ of the archaeologist Sir Henry Layard .  A different <head>sort</head> of description is an artist 's copy of a work . Copying was a well - paid occupation in nineteenth - century France ,  since private collectors and travellers were happy to have copies of pictures in famous collections like the Louvre .

It was a Romantic notion that there were resonances in the natural world and art ;  and it was Schiller who argued that music ,  the visual arts and poetry always become similar in their action on the mind .  THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE Describing the object is not the only <head>sort</head> of description that a reader can expect from a critic . The critic may be willing to share an experience with the reader ,  sometimes only of the circumstances in which a work was seen ,  as might be included in a personality article ;  but on other occasions the critic may give a fuller account of a personal response to a work of art .  This then becomes not a description of the object itself ,  but of the critical appreciation or dislike that the work gives rise to .

This theory of stages in understanding art is helpful ,  and it will immediately be realised that the first two stages fit in with description ,  the next two with interpretation ,  while the final stage is judgement .

The theory is nevertheless of a <head>sort</head> which can be of real use in a classroom . Perhaps the most usual description of aesthetic experience in the last hundred years has occurred when the critic has been faced with the need to react to one isolated work of art .

Hawksmoor  speaks the words of romantic duality ,  and is in a number of ways a double book .  It consists of two alternating narratives ,  one of which is set in the eighteenth century and the other in the present ,  with the earlier delivered in the first person .  Each of the two principal actors glimpses his double in passing , as a reflection in a glass , and each stands to the other in the same relation a relation which presupposes , as in many other Gothic texts , some <head>sort</head> of metempsychosis or rebirth . Both of these men are disturbed or mad .  Nicholas Dyer is imagined as the builder of Nicholas Hawksmoor 's  churches in the East End of London ;  the enlightened edifices of a rational Christianity are thereby ascribed to a devil - worshipper ,  while the name Hawksmoor is assigned to the Detective Chief Superintendent who ,  in the later narrative ,  frets himself into a delirium over a series of stranglings which takes place in the vicinity of the churches .

In the second book ,  a photograph is spoken of which shows the pulling down of a monument to one of the Shahs  ( father or son )  in Teheran or some other Iranian city .  It is hard to be sure about the year the photograph was taken ,  since the monuments of both Pahlavis were pulled down several times ,  whenever the occasion presented itself to the people .

It matters less and less as we move into an enjoyable account derived from a vocational puller - down of statues of the Shah and his father .  The Shah was equal to these demolitions :  If we pulled one down ,  he set up three .

Guesses are hazarded ,  and are quoted from interviews he conducted .

Ursula figures as some <head>sort</head> of Hungarian countess whose parents were estranged and who was to be estranged from her ominous father . There she once sat in some sort of castle ,  or not ,  reading ,  for sure ,  the literature of Romanticism ,  and growing up to resemble  in the opinion of the writer 's  aunt ,  the historian C. B. A. Behrens  a character out of Lermontov .  Lermontov ,  for his part ,  was a character out of Byron ,  and so was Pechorin ,  the hero of our time in Lermontov 's  novel of 1839 ,  one of those people who are fated to attract all kinds of unusual things .

The beauty of the earlier prose is ,  in part ,  a beauty of grace notes ,  the pointing of sentences ,  charged elegance and buoyant ,  intelligent wit .  In Take a girl like you  a great sentence falls like the dew from heaven during one of the scenes in Amis when a terminally drunk man endures a sexual turmoil and fiasco ,  is stunned by a stunning but not very nice girl .  This particular girl , a model , is putting Patrick in his place by going on about cars : Most of my friends have them on the firm , she said , with the <head>sort</head> of lift of the old proud head that he could hardly believe had not accompanied a limiting judgment on Villiers de l'Isle Adam . In Difficulties with girls  there are passages which recall that lift of the old proud head .  In silence ,  the two almost bowed almost stiffly to each other ,  behaving rather like two  well ,  two somethings - or - other ,  thought Patrick .

The difference yields a political meaning ,  in other words ,  and it would also appear to relate to the old theory of the difference between an author who tells and an author who shows ,  and who employs a medley of voices in order to do so .  It is a distinction which may in the end prove more suggestive than serviceable :  the author who tells ,  and who can be accounted something of a ventriloquist ,  may well ,  for instance ,  be more than capable of carnival ,  and may even be every bit as plural in his works as his dialogic counterpart .  But it is possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lies at the heart of it may be successfully applied both to some <head>sorts</head> of contemporary author and to some of what went before . The status of comedy is crucial to the debate ,  and we can at least be sure that Kingsley Amis would not object to having his practice compared with Waugh 's  ,  or to being placed with him among the monologists of the Right .  Against this monologic Amis can be set ,  by way of alter ego ,  the modernistic Amis of Barbara Everett 's  discussion of Difficulties with girls  ,  which occurred in the course of an essay on Hugh Kenner 's  fantasy of a British betrayal of Modernism ,  and which springs the surprise of conveying that Amis ,  so often supposed an enemy of Modernism ,  is really a Modernist .

But perhaps it is not too simple to suggest that we are also conscious of Zuckerman as a deflection of the wrath over Roth which works by making Zuckerman responsible for the outrage .  We are conscious of what Zuckerman does for Roth :  when he helps a man to gather his spilt heart pills ,  it is Roth helping himself by assigning a small mercy .  In The Facts , the tough guy with his shiksas , the supposedly self - hating Diaspora Jew , can be tenderised a word Roth likes , for all the awkwardness it imparts to the operations to which it refers into a <head>sort</head> of uxorious submission where his parents are concerned . This is a state which Zuckerman experiences and which he sends up. In the fictional conversation about adverse publicity a good mother meets a son anxious to reassure her ,  while alive to the comedy of it .

My very writing became a different adventure ,  no longer the dolorous itinerary of a convalescent ,  no longer a begging for compassion and friendly faces ,  but a lucid building ,  which now was no longer solitary ;  the work of a chemist who weighs and divides ,  measures and judges on the basis of assured proofs ,  and strives to answer questions .  These remarks concerning If this is a man  do not describe the kind of book which runs easily to sequels ,  and which is easy to live up to .  Nor do they describe the <head>sort</head> of thing we are supposed to like very much . The first two autobiographies ,  that is to say ,  are the kind of book to which a tradition of literary interpretation has been inimical ,  imagining for itself a literature of impersonality ,  in which autobiography is subsumed ,  invisible .  Philip Roth 's  article refers to this issue in referring to the later book If not now ,  when  ?   Levi 's  Eastern ,  an adventure story of Jewish partisans during the closing months of the war ,  led by the Communist fighter - fiddler Gedaleh .

The work that Levi valued is of an order to which Auschwitz  with the lying motto over its gates ,  Arbeit macht frei   was built to be antithetical .

It bore a hideous resemblance to the blighting , punishing <head>sorts</head> of work which are common in the world at large . And yet there was a work of survival to be attempted in the camps .  Intelligence ,  vigilance ,  practicality ,  cunning ,  luck ,  friendship  Levi was crucially helped by donations from an Italian workman he barely knew ,  and by the exercise of his skills as a chemist  kept you going and ,  in some few cases ,  made you free .

The class structure of Northern Ireland is predictably dominated by protestants .  Of course ,  with the development of international monopoly capital and multinational companies ,  additional sources of power have been brought into play .  But it is likely that the professionals who have been responsible for the running of such companies at local level will have been allied to the more liberal group among the upper protestant classes , as represented by such families as the O'Neills , who have looked to the English public schools for the right <head>sort</head> of education . Wallis ,  Bruce ,  and Taylor  ( 1986 )  list this mainly landed gentry among the cosmopolitans of Ulster society .  Also cosmopolitan in outlook are a variety of traditional professions ,  particularly university lecturers .

But now ,  on the basis of a number of well - documented opinion polls ,  W. Harvey Cox  ( 1985 )  argues that the majority in the Republic of Ireland favouring reunification is barely two to one ,  and that in the island as a whole it is three to two .  What is more ,  Cox suggests that support in the South is at best lukewarm .  None the less , the characterization of catholic nationalist ideology I have just documented would seem to fly in the face of this <head>sort</head> of evidence . The general data presented by Cox are undeniable ,  but interpretation of the data rests on certain assumptions ,  principally that people act on an individualistic basis rather than as groups ,  and according to attitudes expressed in the quiet of their homes rather than in response to major events .  One remembers the substantial surge in Provisional support in the North on the occasion of the hunger strikes of 1981 ,  and the impact they had on Northern catholic  nationalist consciousness ,  one which Cox himself acknowledges .

The job paid quite well and I could perhaps at that stage have afforded somewhere slightly better to live ,  but I 'd got used to my new home and I was still keen to try and build up some savings again .

My job was to operate the telephone switchboard , <head>sort</head> the morning post , direct house - callers to the appropriate organization , and that was about it . The telephones kept me just about busy but the potential for job satisfaction in the tasks I was required to do was almost nil .  This was ,  I kept telling myself ,  just a staging post .

( 1966 :  72 )  recognized such unobtrusive measures have found favour in field - work and I discovered at an early stage that the problem remains one of revealing the structural warts of the system while somehow indicating that this need not be seditious ;  and indeed might even be of some value .  As it is ,  when I showed close colleagues my first working paper  ( Young 1979a )  on experiences in a police bridewell  ( see Chapters 2 and 3 )  ,  they were alarmed .  I was told on more than one occasion , that I should not really let outsiders see this <head>sort</head> of thing , even though it was agreed that what I had written was an accurate analysis of events . In some respects ,  I think it was the detail of the ethnographic thick description which most alarmed them ;  for as almost all of them wistfully pointed out :  it shows exactly how we do the business .  In effect the insider who questions the gross systems of classification which define police practice seems set to join those deviants or criminals who contest the system of law and order by breaking its rules and regulations .

Another of his famous works was the Otsar Taamei Chazel  ,  or The Treasury Of Rabbinic Interpretations  ,  a thesaurus of views and definitions which was hailed as brilliant ,  indeed ,  unique in the sacred literature of his people .  Rabbi Klinitsky - Klein and his family had escaped to Canada through the good offices of a Jewish agency in 1923 the <head>sort</head> movingly described by Norman Glimotsky in his My Life , My Destiny .

With the disappearance of temple - worship as such ,  this fell into misuse ,  but a new significance took its place ,  which would have had particular significance for Leonard 's  parents and grandparents .  At this time the father dedicates his son to the study of the Torah or to the rabbinate .  There can be no doubt that something of this <head>sort</head> took place at this time in Montreal , and that it forms one of the subconscious inputs in the growing boy 's development , along with the high family traditions and the significance of his names . Moreover ,  the covenant with Israel signified by circumcision was offered to make of the nation A kingdom of priests and a holy nation .  ,  The whole people were theoretically a kingdom of priests by virtue of their privileged relationship with God .

War had been declared ,  and the fate of Czechoslovakia ,  Austria and Poland was sealed ,  as it would be for several other countries .  It would be six years before that anger would begin to subside ,  six years of unspeakable anguish for those of Hebrew persuasion ,  when unbelievable monstrosities would be inflicted on them ,  by the end of which half of the world 's  Jewry had been murdered .  This was carefully shielded from the growing boy , though horror of a personal , more penetrating <head>sort</head> was to obtrude itself soon enough on him. The genteel and pleasant routine of life which he understood ,  despite the lengthening shadow of his father 's  illness ,  was convulsed in 1943 ,  when Nathan Cohen died ,  and the family was plunged into loss and grief .  Masha Cohen had always felt an outsider ,   vis -  - vis her more Westernised sisters - in - law.

Leonard could be fastidious to the nth degree in completing his own work  he has always said that he works one word at a time ,  and can spend months ,  even years ,  in adding finesse to it ;  he is nevertheless dismissive of anything approaching scholarly exactitude ,  still more so pedantry .  It is not clear where this comes from .  There is certainly an element which highly values the proprieties of artistic freedom : a work of art must be a work of free spirit , untrammelled by rules and regulations , wherein absolute consistency or conformity of any <head>sort</head> is out of place . But there also seems to be a more personal element ,  too .  In The  Favourite Game he turns on those who produce such work in a wholly negative way .

Leonard was fortunate in being welcomed  virtually as an equal  -  into the regular company of such as these older poets .  Not merely welcomed among them ,  but escorted around the country by them to various literary and poetry events ,  and often presented to their confrres as their protg .   It was during this time that he was invited to the discussions of the CIV/n group , a gathering of poets of the more serious <head>sort</head> and to some extent inspired by Ezra Pound 's revitalising energies , even as its name was culled from his writings who had just launched a new poetry magazine of that name . It included such as Wanda Staniszewska ,  Jackie Gallagher ,  Buddy Rozynski  ( cousin of Louis Dudek )  and Aileen Collins  ( later to be Mrs L. Dudek )  ,  Robert A. Currie ,  Yaffa Lerner ,  Anna Azzulo ,  Betty Sutherland  ( later Mrs Sutherland Layton )  ,  and Dudek himself .  Between April 1953 and March 1954 they produced the first five issues ,  meeting in Layton 's  home ,  occasionally at Rosengarten 's  ,  to discuss The Things That Matter  their latest poetry and material offered by others ,  not infrequently being led in song by Leonard on his ever - present guitar .

No one brought up in the Jewish faith with his <head>sort</head> of European connections could fail to be unaware , or convulsed , by the nightmare we call the Holocaust . Nightmares and night - time anxiety ,  are a regular feature of Leonard 's  work ,  though he did remark to us ,  I do n't think  that I was scarred by anything .  For someone whose life has been lived in search of the word ,  who perceived that a scar is what happens when the word is made flesh ,  who owned that his education began on hearing of the Holocaust ,  it is not a convincing comment .

The university authorities liked it ,  and readily consented to the use of its name .  Leonard was a natural choice for the first of the new series ,  both in bearing and background he represented ,  not merely McGill ,  but Canada itself ;  he was accordingly approached .  A manuscript of poems was assembled by him for the Professor to view ; the intention being ( and Dudek was very well experienced in this <head>sort</head> of work ) for him to take the matter over and see it through to publication . But Leonard bad different ideas .  He had seen beyond the excitement of being approached for his first book ;  he already visualised it on the bookshelves !

Apart from organising his domestic life ,  Stella Pullman was a disciplinarian in the old British landlady tradition  ( her husband was a former RAF pilot who now flew for BOAC )  .

That <head>sort</head> of failure does not belong to Leonard Cohen , he is by nature an industrious and self - conscious worker , if restless ; and so he stayed . He got plenty of work done there ;  he made friends ;  he felt liberated and enjoyed himself .  He even found English girls desirable ,  a girl called Elizabeth in particular .

This pity ,  compassion or mercy ,  is quintessentially Jewish hasidic ;  to such God is essentially the God of Mercy and Compassion .  As against that central epithet of the rabbis ,  the justice of God ,  they posited the creative ,  life - giving and life - nurturing aspect of mercy  .  Sainthood and mercy are entities of the most considerable <head>sort</head> in Leonard Cohen 's work , as we shall see . Stephen Scobie ,  in emphasising the motif of sainthood in Leonard 's  writing ,  completely omits reference to this key Jewish emphasis ,  which would have prevented him from some of his more questionable comments ,  such as the reference to them as social outcasts .  Whether that is so in other societies ,  which is highly questionable ,  is irrelevant .

According to this account ,  the mind - body distinction as we know it was invented by Descartes .  He it was who conceived the idea of identifying mind with consciousness and of claiming that consciousness and its contents are radically different sods of things from bodies and their properties .  The mind is a <head>sort</head> of arena in which private objects are viewed : all our experience is , ultimately , confined to this arena . Descartes ,  so the story goes ,  reached this conception because ,  unlike his predecessors ,  the Aristotelians ,  he was obsessed by epistemological questions  that is ,  questions about what we can know and how we can know it .  He thought that the only things of which we could be really certain were things of which we were directly aware ,  that is ,  things in our own minds .

By contrast ,  the metaphysical question of what the preconditions are for the world 's  being accessible to thought was uppermost for Plato and Aristotle .  This is explained via the role of form  in the world .  The important thing about form , in either the Platonic or Aristotelian senses , is that forms are the <head>sort</head> of things that can be thought , or apprehended intellectually . There is ,  in common sense ,  something close to a paradox which generates the problem of universals .  This problem dominated philosophy from Plato until the seventeenth century .

This thought casts the world in a profoundly different light from common sense in its materialistic moment ;  and much of metaphysics can be seen as a response to it .  Aristotle was the first to try to naturalize the veins of generality that must structure any intelligible world ,  by saying that forms in things were individuals ,  not universals .  The controversy surrounding the interpretation of Aristotle 's conception of form is unending , but , on all interpretations , his objective is to give forms as great an affinity with particulars as is possible , consistent with their retaining a <head>sort</head> of generality which is , so to speak , released in the intellect when they are thought . Something that was not form ,  but was only matter ,  could not become general in this way and could not answer to the generality of  the concepts with which we think .  The naturalistic instinct has been to claim that mind somehow creates generality in a sense stronger than that which Aristotle allows ;  it does not merely release generality from its potential state in matter ,  but fabricates it .

The purport of that attack was to prove that generality could never be an intrinsic property of a mental content .  Berkeley 's  reason for thinking this was that he believed mental contents to be mental images ,  and there cannot be a general image .  It never seemed to occur to him that a general idea might be an entirely different <head>sort</head> of thing from an image . Ideas ,  according to Berkeley ,  are particulars whose significance is explained by saying that they stand for  the things they represent .  This naturally prompts the question what it is for one purely particular object to stand for  another .

But even if treating our awareness of our own mental states as topic - neutral plausibly explains why we are not aware of our brains as such when we are aware of our mental states ,  it does not explain why knowing fully about the brain does not include knowledge of the nature of experience .  Topic - neutral knowledge is weaker than ,  and hence is entailed by ,  full knowledge ,  though it does not entail it .  So , if the blind scientist BS knows that V is in brain state B and that B is the state usually brought about by experience of a red object , then he knows that V is in some state or other of the <head>sort</head> usually brought about by red objects . So ,  if he abstracts from his knowledge of what the brain state actually is ,  he can form the same conception of experience as that had by the subject of the experience .  In brief ,  topic neutrality was invoked to explain why ,  within the materialist scheme ,  consciousness of our mental states is not sufficient for knowledge of them as  brain states :  what it cannot do is explain why knowledge of brain states is not sufficient for knowledge of their nature as conscious states .

A rather similar ,  and equally mistaken ,  line of thought which might appeal is as follows .  It might be thought that the subject 's  apprehension of his own brain is more immediate  and more holistic  than any external knowledge ,  however complete ,  and that this explains the experiential difference between the two kinds of knowledge .  The scientist has essentially separate pieces of information , whereas the subject has a <head>sort</head> of Gestalt . Once again ,  this explanation shows a failure to grasp the radicalness of the physicalist perspective .  A Gestalt  is a mode of perception of a  group of objects  say of the dots in a printed picture  so that they are seen as one thing .

I now turn to a consideration of some implications of the cognitive neuropsychology of face recognition for phenomenology  an approach to the mind and mental phenomena that gives prominence to introspectible phenomena understood as acts of consciousness and their immediate objects .  Phenomenologists such as Dreyfus  ( 1972 )  argue that the level of explanation utilized in cognitive science does not truly exist .  The physical brain and the world of introspectible phenomenal experience are all that there really is : no cognitive psychologist has succeeded in defining another <head>sort</head> of input between these two which would provide the ultimate bits of information to which rules are applied ( p. 199 ) . My favourite phenomenological quote ,  however ,  comes from Jennings  ( 1986 )  :  social psychologists spent years conducting experiments to specify the exact parameters of a hypothetical motivational state called cognitive dissonance

These were eventually formalized in the Weber - Fechner law which reported a quantitative relationship between stimulus and subjective experience ,  the sensation increasing in proportion to the logarithm of the magnitude of the physical stimulus .  A quantitative correlation between the objective intensity of stimulus and the pattern of neural activity was subsequently demonstrated by physiologists recording from individual fibres .  Since the work of S. S. Stevens in the 1930s and later , it has been recognized that , although the Weber - Fechner Law holds for many <head>sorts</head> of sensory experience , the exponent varies widely ; nevertheless , the principle of a quantitative correlation between external stimulus , neural activity and experienced sensation remains intact and now appears to be well - established . So much for the basic laws .  The repeated confirmation of the correlation between the physical characteristics of the stimulus and the characteristics of the neural activity it triggers ,  and between the characteristics of the stimulus and that of the subjective sensation ,  has encouraged the belief that our sensations are in some sense to be understood in terms of a set of stimulation levels  ( spiking frequencies )  in the appropriate sensory pathways .

Enterprise Inns have signed a five year supply deal with Bass and all their pubs will continue to stock Bass beers .  This sparked immediate criticism that the MMC regulations requiring Bass to free pubs from the tie or sell them had been by - passed .  The Guardian commented that these <head>sorts</head> of deals would simply prompt further government investigations into the industry , unless the pub owning company was seen to be genuinely independent of the brewer . Those publicans stocking a guest beer will lose their rights to do so ,  since Enterprise Inns is not considered to be part of Bass .  Even the Bass list of in - house guest beers will not be available to Enterprise tenants .

Indeed the overall triumph of art in this case is that the novel walks out into our fact rather than ourselves entering its fiction :  a very primitive and absolute form of consumer capitulation .  Dostoevsky has an impudent way of making his narrator declare As a chronicler I confine myself to presenting events exactly as they happened ,  and it 's  not my fault if they appear incredible  like the son of the house writing home about his time on the North - West Frontier of India .

There are still many able academics who see their activity as  research in the traditional sense ,  by engaging in biographical ,  historical ,  or editorial work .  But where English departments are concerned research is more usually understood in the broader sense of adding conceptual rather than factual knowledge ,  which in practice means the proliferation of interpretation .  The brighter <head>sort</head> of aspiring academic is more commonly found marking up paperback copies of standard texts in different coloured inks than delving in libraries . Indeed ,  Terence Hawkes has defined and defended what he calls paperback research as a proper activity for those who lack the scholarly resources of the ancient universities .  The advent of poststructuralism has given a great impetus to interpretive productivity ,  since all the literary texts that were once interpreted to show organic unity and complexity of meaning can now be interpreted to reveal underlying clashes .

The experience of reading major works of literature can have an overpowering effect on the responsive reader  ( usually ,  but by no means invariably ,  the young reader )  .

There is ,  in fact ,  a good case for resisting the takeover of literature by culture ,  though it is not as strong as I once thought it was .  My doubts have grown during the years I have been thinking about and then writing this book ,  but for the moment I will concede that for many scholars and teachers a clarion - call to defend literature as literature would prove rousing and timely .

This is the same reader who ,  having decided that the Envoi is  literary  ,  in a limiting sense ,  is provoked by the word magic in the middle stanza into deciding that the term literary becomes a good deal more limiting ,  for the term aesthetic rises to our lips ,  and so ,  perhaps ,  does American  ' And there we have it !

And does n't this give us  faintly indeed ,  but unmistakably  just what we 've looked for in vain in all the other Sicilian allusions :  that 's  to say ,  evidence that when Pound was in Sicily he did n't go around with his eyes closed ,  his ears and nostrils stopped ?  For that surely is the disconcerting ,  downright depressing ,  reflection that this sorry catalogue must leave us with .  Sicily for Pound never but once had any existence that was n't either verbal ( as in the wordplay on Trinacria or the Eleanors ) , or else notional , ideological ( as providing a <head>sort</head> of slender mnemonic crutch for a tendentious reading of history ) . The contrast with Yeats is instructive ,  and it does n't work in Pound 's  favour .

True enough ,  but how easily this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who attempts to deal with things that matter must be a bore ,  that rather than run the risk of talking nonsense one should play it safe and stick to charming trifles .  This ,  remember ,  is W. H. Auden ,  whom for many years some people in England have regarded as himself too anxious not to bore ,  too anxious always to amuse .  If this suggests that there are other sorts of English people than the <head>sort</head> Auden has in his sights , on the other hand it lends point and force to his censure of Beerbohm , and of what Beerbohm stands for in English life . Auden goes on :   As it is ,  he slyly suggests that minor artists may look down their noses at major ones and that important work may be left to persons of an inferior kennel ,  like the Russians ,  the Germans ,  the Americans ,  who ,  poor dears ,  know no better .

We may even feel ,  as certainly  I do ,  that some of the later cantos are of such a nature that it 's  hard to conceive in any  age of a way of encountering them other than the way we 're here embarked upon .  And yet we need to remember  Pound ,  I think ,  would have wanted us to remember  what a latecome development this is in the relations between a poet and his readers ,  how recent this is ,  and ,  in the perspective of history ,  how bizarre .  We may surely placate the shade of Max Beerbohm sufficiently to acknowledge that the danger we run in approaching poetry this way is indeed the danger of one <head>sort</head> of professionalism specialized and therefore blinkered , inflexible , and humourless . I suspect that Pound is rueful at best when he looks down and sees us industriously annotating out of Sir Edward Coke Canto 107 ,  without noticing that the English language is in that canto handled with none of the sensitivity that would make those labours worthwhile .  What I am saying is that a lot of the common English objections to Ezra Pound have substance ,  and would be worth taking seriously ,  if only we could be sure that they were advanced in good faith ,  in humility ,  and with compassion .

Moreover Pound 's  anti - Semitism ,  later so notorious ,  certainly casts a sinister light on his readiness to broach these issues .  Yet these matters ,  it has been suggested ,  lie deep  indeed ,  unutterably  deep  in every American psyche ;  and it is good that from time to time the unutterable be uttered  it is ,  one might say ,  one of the things that we look to poets for .  There can be little doubt for instance that the doubtfulness or downright hostility felt towards Eliot by some Americans , particularly in recent decades , derives from the <head>sort</head> of American Eliot was and remained , long after he had taken British citizenship . Eliot hailed from St Louis ,  but the Eliots there seem to have regarded themselves as Bostonian and Unitarian missionaries to that mid - western Philistia .  The poet did not share this sense ,  he actively disliked it ,  but he could not escape  not even in Europe  from what he saw as the balefulness of that inheritance .

And if Pound so blithely overlooks that difference ,  does n't that mean that we have in him a critic who attends to form ,  to style ,  at the expense of what that form and that style are used so as to convey ?  Don't we have in him a formalist ,  in fact an aesthete ?  This is the brickbat that has been thrown at Pound from the first , and is thrown at him still , because of his unswerving attention to what makes poetry poetry , and not some other <head>sort</head> of discourse versified . It was the accusation ,  or the selfaccusation ,  that Pound wrestled with in Hugh Selwyn Mauberley  ,  and settled not wholly to his own or any one else 's  satisfaction .  In The Hard and Soft in French Poetry Pound confronts the issue very early ,  and deals with it to my mind conclusively .

Nor is there any need to risk being challenged by alternative social visions ,  to attend to the views of every crackpot messiah round the world ,  since it matters very little what strange thoughts occur to people in Albania or Burkina Faso ,  for we are interested in what one could in some sense call the common ideological heritage of mankind .  Just so might the exhausted arrogance of a dying empire have expressed itself on the lips of a Roman senator waving away the news of a crackpot messiah among the Jews ,  and the strange thoughts that occur to people in Jerusalem or Galilee .  It does occur to Fukuyama that religion might have some <head>sort</head> of unease to express with all this , but he appears to conceive of religion under only two modes . On the one hand ,  there is fundamentalist counter - ideology ,  such as the Islamic theocratic state .  This ,  it is to be assumed ,  his liberal readers may take seriously as a threat ,  but hardly as an option .

This ,  it is to be assumed ,  his liberal readers may take seriously as a threat ,  but hardly as an option .  And on the other hand ,  there are less organised religious impulses ,  religion as individual preference .  This he knows can readily be accommodated as yet another <head>sort</head> of consumer commodity , within the sphere of personal life permitted in liberal societies . But there is no need to look to crackpot messiahs or fundamentalist theocracies to find a decisive religious rejection of Fukuyama 's  reading of human history .  For him ,  the energies driving history have been derived from the interplay between external forces ,  conflicting visions of the right ordering of society .

The skin not waxy ,  but translucent ;  the texture not oily ,  but clean and dry .  It still looks like a foot ,  but a very nice foot really .  Affecting nonchalance , I pluck it up , and begin nuzzling ; and , yes , it is a fairly rewarding <head>sort</head> of thing to eat . Not much flavour ,  but a fibrous - to - spongy chewiness which sets it apart from the average savoury snack .  Now for the sheep 's  eyes .

China maintains the same professed intentions .  The Basic Law will still be enacted ,  promising a panoply of rights and freedoms for 50 years beyond 1997 .  But the Chinese Constitution contains all <head>sorts</head> of promises , too so many that it could probably have been construed to forbid the People 's Liberation Army from shooting dead hundreds of unarmed civilians , and to prohibit the arbitrary arrest , summary trial or execution of thousands more . Tiananmen demonstrated what most people in Hong Kong well knew ,  but preferred not to admit :  that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party can and will do absolutely anything ,  however brutal and illegal ,  to further their grip on power .  The notion that they will be circumscribed by a Joint Declaration or a Basic Law ,  so confidently advanced in 1984 ,  now seems like a distant dream ;  1997 ,  by contrast ,  suddenly seems very real ,  and very close .

Today they make up a sad string of tarnished beads ,  from Bombay ,  Calcutta and Rangoon to Saigon  ( now Ho Chi Minh City )  ,  Hanoi and Canton .  The city which became the most depressing ghost of its former self was Shanghai .  Although it harboured the worst <head>sort</head> of poverty , inequality and exploitation during the 1930s and 1940s , not least because its bright lights attracted millions from the surrounding countryside , it seethed with exuberant life and economic activity . Then ,  under Mao Tse - tung 's  triumphant Communists in the 1950s and 1960s ,  it declined into a depressing ,  monochromatic shell of its former self .  Today ,  the spectre of Shanghai 's  past haunts the Hong Kong 's  future .

MUCH TO their chagrin ,  the woes of Chancellor Kohl 's  centre - right coalition have yet to produce a solid wave of support for the Social Democrats .  Successive state elections have seen the governing parties pummelled by a dismayed electorate .  But the SPD , instead of exuding the <head>sort</head> of assurance suggesting that the general election in December next year belongs to it , struggles to hide its edginess . The party reacted with unnecessary embarrassment and defensiveness to government attacks on general talks it has been holding with the Greens ,  and its desire ,  as part of its traditional Ostpolitik ,  to press on with contacts with the Communist party in East Berlin despite the sudden surge of open opposition to the government by East German citizens .  Two impressive victories this year ,  in Berlin and in Frankfurt ,  producing municipal coalitions with the Greens ,  were a fillip for party morale .

The differences in our electorate are much bigger than for the conservative parties ,  says Heidi Wieczorek - Zeul ,  a member of the party praesidium .  Tactically to combine the interests of a miner and an environmentalist just does not work .  It can only be done with conviction , with the <head>sort</head> of approach we used in 1969 with Ostpolitik . Today ,  ecological and women 's  issues are the equivalent of Ostpolitik for us .  The party leader ,  Hans - Jochen Vogel ,  a rather uninspiring figure ,  has nonetheless proved adept at managing this delicate evolution which ,  bolder than anything the Labour party ever contemplated ,  has avoided the sort of fratricidal bloodletting which ravaged its British counterpart .

Pyrah 's  winning partner is qualified for the top competitions here but ,  because of his youth ,  the rider intends to use him with discretion .  The 2,000 which Andy Austin collected ,  by finishing fourth on Elusive and sixth on Zobias ,  was considerably more than the meagre 240 he won when riding River Hill to victory in yesterday 's  first leg of the Grade A Championship .  It was very hard work for that <head>sort</head> of money and I consider it an insult , Austin said of the earlier award . If he wins the next two legs ,  today and tomorrow ,  his total prize money as overall Grade A champion will only amount to 970  but he will have the opportunity to compete at Wembley for the rest of the week .  .  New Zealand 's  Olympic gold medallist ,  Mark Todd ,  has accepted a last - minute ride for today 's  Working Hunter Championship .

Alun Evans ,  secretary of the Welsh football association who doubles up as chairman of the UAU committee ,  said :  I was informed by the chairman of the UAU rugby committee that he was discussing the possible sponsorship of its championship and I received a copy of a proposal it contained a number of features which were not acceptable to the union and it was therefore with great surprise that we learned a launch for the sponsorship had been called and it was decided that the union could not agree to this action .

The London Borough of Hammersmith has previously rejected inspired schemes by at least two of Britain 's  most interesting architects .  Both Norman Foster ,  architect of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank headquarters ,  and Terry Farrell ,  designer of the new - look Charing Cross station complex ,  developed highly intelligent proposals for the reconstruction of Hammersmith Broadway .  Instead of Farrell or Foster , Hammersmith settled for a flashy Post - Modern office and retail development which , while providing the <head>sort</head> of covered spaces the borough wanted , led nowhere architecturally . By voting for Ralph Erskine there is a chance  assuming that executive architects Rock Townsend and Lennart Bergstroms can reach the meticulous standards set by their Swedish master  that Hammersmith will point the way ahead for a new generation of user - friendly ,  environmentally soft commercial architecture .

Cutting back and forward furiously ,  Royston tries to include the complex relationship between Ruth 's  father and his ageing boy ,  Tim  ( Ilarrio Bisi - Pedro )  ;  as well as a portrait of Gumede ,  a freedom fighter on the verge of lunacy  excellently played by Osei Bentil ;  and an analysis of a South African police Colonel who is affably stark mad .  There is not room for all of this .  Which is a pity , because one would have liked particularly to hear more of the ebullient Gumede , a <head>sort</head> of Mad Max of the townships . White people !  he spits disgustedly at Ruth ,  you talk of life and death and other rubbish  because you have a future .  In a finale the police colonel complements Gumede as he describes his ideal home :  Freedom ,  man.

Retiring MB Group chairman Dr Brian Smith said yesterday that any short term dilution in the company 's  earnings would be minimal .  The impact on MB Group 's  balance sheet of acquiring sizeable goodwill in both ABS and Caradon is mostly offset by the issue of 150m US preferred stock and a handy 80m revaluation of its CMB stake to leave pro forma gearing at 24 per cent .  This suggests that the next MB Group foray will require fresh equity of some <head>sort</head> but investors may not find that too alarming .

He has said that the 15m on offer was either too little or too much  too little to pacify the bankers if Eagle was in trouble but if the group could be turned around a recapitalisation would not be needed .  Mr Fitton yesterday made clear that he had always been acting in an independent capacity in the offer for Eagle ,  and that it had no connection with Braithwaite .  Whoever <head>sorts</head> Eagle out will make a lot of money , Mr Fitton said . Beneath the can of worms there are some very good businesses .  However ,  Braithwaite ,  which specialises in plant hire ,  had tried to take over Samuelson ,  the film equipment hire company bought by Eagle in 1987 .

More power to his noble elbow .

They may not always exhibit the wisdom of Solomon but at least they might know where to draw the line .

Beeson ,  the England captain ,  scored his first victory over the world No. 9 ,  Zarak Jahan Khan ,  with one of the finest performances of his career ,  and then complained about the remarks he claimed his opponent had been making during the rallies .  I told him that was quite unnecessary ,  Beeson said .  It made me angry , and that <head>sort</head> of thing makes me get stuck in . These results caused Jonah Barrington ,  the former world No. 1 who has waited an age for signs of Englishmen who might become world beaters in the way that he did ,  to make an interesting boast .  At last we are getting the reward for our hard work and we will be challenging for the world title ourselves in a couple of years ,  he said .
