A RULE OF THUMB It will by now have become evident that this book takes an unorthodox approach to art criticism .  There will be no attempt to define exactly what art criticism is , or to set out a theory of criticism , beyond the suggestions of some <head>differences</head> in writings on art which have already been made . Nor will a history of art criticism be attempted .  The stress of the book falls on a viewer 's  encounter with a work of art ,  and how a prior reading of a piece of art criticism can improve that encounter .

The decorative flatness and the higher colour of Japanese art also follow as products of the same climatic necessity .  Similar passages of critical reflection or speculation can be found in many books .  Formal <head>differences</head> in art have been linked to places in varied ways , one of the best - known Renaissance contrasts being the stress on line evident in Florentine art as against the colourist approach of the Venetians , a city on water .

Does an English liking for watercolour spring from the country 's  climate ?  Does the flat landscape of the Netherlands impose a special sort of vision on Dutch artists ?  The reverse of the coin is internationalism , a feature , some might say , of twentieth - century art ; not so uncommon either in other periods , where art historians struggle heroically to identify <head>differences</head> between the art of one country and another . Some of these struggles have been inspired by base motives  desires to appropriate art to a national or a political cause .  But some such efforts can have sympathy ,  as in those stirrings of national spirit in central Europe before 1914 ,  when literature ,  language and music were fuel for Czech ,  Polish or Hungarian aspirations .

Max Friedlander ,  an outstanding scholar of Northern European art ,  took the view that accepting a work into an artist 's  oeuvre was like recognising a friend ,  not a matter of measurement or detailed scrutiny .  The reader is thus relying on Friedlander 's  eye .  A <head>difference</head> between Morelli and Friedlander is that the former explains his method , while the latter does not. More than a hundred years have passed since Morelli started writing ;  in that time many problems of authorship have been solved ,  while about others tacit agreement has been reached .  The results of this process can be read in detail in catalogues raisonns ,  which often give a blow - by - blow account of the arguments of scholars over the years .

A case of unwitting collusion by a critic in a manoeuvre by an art  dealer occurred in 1961 ,  when Leo Steinberg wrote an article about Jasper Johns .  Johns was a puzzling phenomenon for Steinberg ,  as one of the artists of Pop Art ,  then hardly begun .  The article appeared in an Italian magazine Metro , who had intended to pay 300 for an article ; but when Johns ' dealer , Leo Castelli , knew that Steinberg was considering an article , he arranged for the magazine to offer 1,000 , paying the <head>difference</head> of 700 himself . Steinberg knew nothing about it .  The underlying question for a reader of criticism is what influences are exerted on the critic ;  but as in this instance ,  for long it may be impossible to know the truth .

It is not altogether satisfactory to call a print by an artist on the same theme as one of his paintings a description .  After all ,  it is an original work in itself .  Nevertheless , the <head>differences</head> between painting and print may be instructive , and help the interpretation of both . By other forms of reproduction an image may be more or less degraded ,  so that nothing can be learnt from them .

Its narrator and chief human presence is by no means straightforwardly a victim , and the <head>difference</head> between oppressor and oppressed can be hard to identify . The novel is narrated by a Moslem of Indian origin ,  whose family has been settled on the east coast of Africa ,  as traders .  Salim leaves them ,  takes off on the first of a series of flights ,  and treks to the interior ,  to a country which appears to be compounded of the Congo and of Uganda ,  in order to earn a living from a store which he has acquired from a man whose daughter he is expected to marry one day .

But in The Emperor no detail is adduced that might bring out what <head>differences</head> there could have been between the courtiers and petitioners of Ethiopia and their counterparts elsewhere in the world . Kapuscinski 's  courtiers and petitioners are about as black as Johnson 's  Prince Rasselas ,  who is about as black as he is white .

The <head>difference</head> yields a political meaning , in other words , and it would also appear to relate to the old theory of the difference between an author who tells and an author who shows , and who employs a medley of voices in order to do so . It is a distinction which may in the end prove more suggestive than serviceable :  the author who tells ,  and who can be accounted something of a ventriloquist ,  may well ,  for instance ,  be more than capable of carnival ,  and may even be every bit as plural in his works as his dialogic counterpart .  But it is possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lies at the heart of it may be successfully applied both to some sorts of contemporary author and to some of what went before .

Zuckerman has enabled Roth to deal with the question of the offence he has given to righteous Jews ,  and to come to terms with the rebellious ,  psychedelic ,  philo - Semitic Sixties ,  when Roth 's  writing went ,  with the times ,  derisive and fantastic .

Levi 's  double life as chemist and writer suggests that if art and work need to be separated ,  according to a certain sense of what it is to be a Jew ,  art and work are nevertheless very often the same .  I like to think that he would have accepted that art is work ,  that the work that frees us ,  and is not just punishment ,  is art ,  and that anyone who uses his imagination is an artist .  The categorical <head>difference</head> of the modern world , between artists and others , does not come well out of his reports . His chemistry is intriguing from this point of view .

Everyone who wants to act professionally should try to see as much drama as they possibly can  and this means in the broadest sense ,  watching television ,  cinema ,  visiting the theatre and looking at the actor 's  work carefully and analytically .

Clearly , there is a <head>difference</head> in scale and dimension between the stage , the television screen and the cinema screen , which demand changes in direction and in acting technique . One of the things you will notice when watching the television is that close - ups are used very effectively ,  and so it is of vital importance that the actor has absolute control over his/her face and expression .  You should also look at the ways in which the physical movements of the actor are organised to suit the restraints of the small screen .

This is not unnatural ,  as in the 1970s and early 1980s Spencer was at the Queen 's  University ,  Belfast ,  and an active member of the All Children Together Movement .  Support for this line of approach has been found in Greeley and Rossi 's   ( 1966 )  survey in the USA on the effectiveness of catholic schools .  Based on statistical data for Roman catholics educated in both Roman catholic and other schools , Greeley and Rossi noted as one of their findings that there was little <head>difference</head> in adult religious practice between the two groups . There was a group among former Roman catholic school pupils who exhibited a more intense level of practice ,  but these were also children of fervent Roman catholics .  The causal inference adopted by Greeley and Rossi was that Roman catholic schools only had a clearly identifiable and reinforcing effect on the belief and practice of this group .

This is something  for which surveys ,  including that of Greeley and Rossi ,  are not and cannot be intended .  Another point worth bearing in mind is the very generalizing character of Greeley and Rossi 's  studies .  There was nothing in the studies on the <head>differences</head> between individual catholic schools , either in terms of pupil experiences or the varieties of educational practice and personnel in each school . A black - box approach to the schooling process was used with no direct investigation of processes within the schools .  Finally ,  while it could be argued that Greeley and Rossi tell us something of catholic versus state schooling in the US ,  they have nothing to tell us about catholic versus Christian ,  multi - denominational schools ,  which is what most of the argument in Ireland is about .

The fact that a wide number of manufacturers work to the same pattern means that the caterer who is topping up need not return to the same source for the top - up.

In times past ,  I had tried to get across to the continent as much as possible ,  but now ,  while other people were going abroad for the first time because of all the cheap travel around ,  I was  ( without intending to be anti - social )  doing exactly the opposite and taking a look around the British Isles .  All this did ,  of course ,  cost money ,  but  if you 've had even a comparatively small amount of that and then lost it ,  you do tend to realize how transient the whole thing is and not worry so much about getting it back again .  Besides , I did n't think I could now save enough to make a significant <head>difference</head> to my standard of living when I retired , so I decided I might as well enjoy it while I had the chance . In retrospect ,  I would probably have saved a little bit more ,  but there it is  I did manage to save a little bit anyway .

Barrie Irving ,  the Police Foundation director has presented a paper today outlining research into the Police and Criminal Evidence Act  ( PACE )  .  Having some 1979 data on custody practices and prisoner interviews he sought to replicate the study in 1986/7 to assess the influence of the legislation on police practice .  Claiming significant <head>differences</head> in post - PACE activities he suggested these showed the need for legal measures to impact upon police practice and influence change . His observational sample of prisoner interviews ,  although small ,  had found the PACE codes of practice were followed to the letter and he argued this showed that it required the sanction of the law to effect changes in interview and interrogation techniques .  A detective inspector shrugged this off ,  arguing from practical mastery and insider 's  knowledge ,  that the practices of doing the business remained undisturbed outside of the PACE interview .

I would enter a plea that I have often made that the street officer 's  authority and discretion should be given better recognition .  It has always seemed to me rather sad that almost any move from beat duty is regarded as a promotion .  Such a plea , although laudable , has little chance of becoming reality in the present organizational set - up , for it ignores the semantic <head>difference</head> in the uniformed polis 's role and that of the 1015 per cent of the institution who form the lite in the CID . For the uniformed wollies at the bottom of the hierarchical pile ,  any move  into detective work can have parallels with a marginal movement .  It becomes a rite of separation into an area where the detective 's  need to juggle with statistics and detection rates is diametrically opposed to the constantly voiced uniform preference for action which is simply programmed to nail the prig down.

It is the world of ESSO men  ( Every Saturday and Sunday Off )  ,  and the real polis 's  scorn is reflected in some of the language of definition which I have outlined here .  Now ,  as a consequence of my eight marginal years on a drug  squad ,  visits to the United Nations ,  and the three years at university reading a subject which few knew anything about ,  but would be willing to dismiss along with all of the social sciences ,  I was in danger of being irrevocably cast into the mould of being a college man or academic .  I was close to being one of them and definitely not one of us because of an acquired list of significant <head>differences</head> . Given that the police are essentially an organization constrained by an ingrained respect for the pragmatism of action  regardless of the lip - service paid to the police college ,  the special course ,  or the university scholarship  it was inevitable that the hierarchy would follow the dictates of institutional philosophy and pull the marginal mover in from the periphery ;  for there is a boundary beyond which the pilgrim cannot be allowed to stray .  In all the legends or tales of the journey to individuation and knowledge ,  the liminal mover always returns to the centre and is reconstituted into structure .

Within the mode of knowledge framework ,  the feel will be explained by the special mode of access to one 's  own  brain .  That this will not do is what I have just argued .  The second response , that the <head>difference</head> consists solely and simply in a mode of knowledge of the external world , without invoking any internal and introspectible feel , requires one to explain perceptual experiences with different modes of access without reference to a subjective component . As far as I can see ,  the only way to do this is to adopt a behaviouristic approach to this knowledge and characterize it as an ability to discriminate visual objects .  To take this road is to resort to what I earlier described as the most primitive physicalist response to the problem ,  which involves denying that there is anything about the nature of experience that BS does not know .

It is the content specifically of sense - perception that must be taken non - reductively ,  if the contrast required by our concept of disposition is to be maintained .  Some philosophers might suspect that I have not considered the behaviouristic theories in their most sophisticated form .  Would it not make a <head>difference</head> if one identified experience , not with some disposition to overt behaviour , but with the behaviour of the brain as it discriminates the various sorts of stimuli within the nervous system ? This is a version of the supposedly post   - behaviourist theory called functionalism ,  which treats mental states as responding to other internal and mental states as well as to external stimuli .  The first thing to notice about functionalism is that it does not fare any better than behaviourism in providing an account of what it is that V knows and BS does not ,  for BS could know all about V 's  functional or covertly behavioural states ;  so there is no lack of knowledge that his deficit could consist in .

Thoughts will be referred to as cognisant acts .  The simplest and most fundamental aspect of cognisance  ( fundamental philosophically and developmentally )  is what is usually referred to as self - world dualism :  the knowledge that there is a physical world out there of which I am an experiencer and that is distinct from me .  Mental development , on the constructivist view , consists in the elaboration of this knowledge ; so that if there is one central <head>difference</head> between the mental processes of the baby , the child , and of the adult it is in terms of how self - world dualism is manifest in ( and to ) the subject . The representational theory of mind treats the explanation of mental life as a kind of engineering problem ;  it starts from the inside  ,  from the representational state ,  and asks how mental states interact with one another to produce something that we would call knowledge ;  the representational theorist proceeds like a sceptical philosopher who thinks that what figures in our mental life is not reality but our mental representations of it  ( recall my saying the Fodor described his position as methodological solipsism )  .  The constructivist starting - point could not be more different ,  and might be said to be biological where the representational theory is engineering  or machinological .

( There is a lot to be said about the role of other persons too ,  but I am leaving that out for the time being .  )  There are three crucial <head>differences</head> between the organism and the objects . ( 1 )  It can move itself and has biological needs  ( not just for food and warmth and the like ,  but the need to use its faculties  Functionlust  as it was once called by a German psychologist )  .  ( 2 )  It has input systems .

It means that we can think about things that are not present .  Sure enough ,  we would expect the input systems to ensure that the right kinds of distinctions are drawn  between contour changes that define occlusion and those which define disappearance ,  for example  but this surely does not mean that the possessor of these input systems is capable of thinking about unperceived entities .  What this adds up to , then , is the claim that if there existed an organism which either could not act or whose actions made no <head>difference</head> to its perceptions then not only would that organism not be cognisant , it could never become cognisant . ( It is not clear to me whether this is some kind of philosophical claim or an hypothesis .  You may say that it is refutable  and so it is empirical ;  but then  see below  our criteria for cognisance are so much bound up with what the subject can do that it is difficult to see how we could assess the cognisance of a totally passive creature .  )

The point of the experiments was this :  strong social pressure  was being put on these children to agree to a realist answer  ( they were not allowed out of the room until they had an answer !  )  and if their usual tendency to interpret questions phenomenally is a trivial and weak effect then this social pressure should obliterate it .  The result was that the social pressure had no effect at all .  In children between four and eight years of age there was absolutely no <head>difference</head> between the number of realist answers produced by the pairs and by the control , solo children . They knew the realist option but did not take it as a way out of a social impasse ,  because ,  I would argue ,  the phenomenalist tendency of thought is too strong .  What dominated their judgements was the salience of the illusion  that  was most up front in consciousness .

Where will the child now point ?  If he points to the empty box then it is probably fair to regard this as deliberate misinforming ,  as the implanting of a false belief in another 's  mind .  In fact we did find a clear <head>difference</head> between the three - and the four - year - olds : the younger ones typically pointed to the box with the chocolate and the older children to the empty box . But what was striking about the three - year - old 's  behaviour here was that they did this for twenty trials  .  They could see that the competitor 's  pile of chocolate growing ever higher and that they were winning nothing ,  and yet they were powerless to do anything about it !

Initially the subject will attend to a new stimulus but will then gradually lose interest and start to look away  ( habituation )  ;  if the stimulus is then changed in some way and if this causes a re - awakening of interest  ( dishabituation )  then we can assume that the baby has detected the change .

The problem is that it is highly improbable that a group of patients with brain injury constitute a natural kind ,  even when they display similar symptoms on some test or other. This is because no two patients are likely to have identical injuries ,  and large groups of patients are even less likely to be homogenous .  In fact , if you probe deeper , vitally important functional <head>differences</head> between patients will emerge . In amnesia ,  as in many other  so called neuropsychological syndromes  ( developmental dyslexia ,  schizophrenia ,  Wemicke 's  aphasia etcetera )  there is probably no uniform pattern in nature waiting to reveal itself .  What you have are groups of people who display superficially similar symptoms for a variety of different reasons .

It is known as a speech output  system because there is evidence that a quite separate lexicon is involved in speech perception .  A pronunciation is addressed either with or without the mediation of the semantic system  our store of word meanings .  The fundamental <head>difference</head> between the two routes , then , is that a pronunciation is either built up from sublexical components ( assembled phonology ) or looked up as a whole ( addressed phonology ) . This model has been extremely successful in enabling us to understand acquired dyslexia .  Acquired dyslexia involves a loss of reading ability as a result of brain injury .

Moreover ,  a closer look at individual patients provides support for what was said about the heterogeneity of groups at the start of this section .  So ,  the more that surface dyslexics are studied ,  the more it becomes obvious that the condition fractionates ;  there are important differences between individual surface dyslexics .  These <head>differences</head> can also be accommodated by the dual route model . For example ,  one surface dyslexic can accurately define the irregular words that he regularizes in pronunciation tasks  ( for instance ,  pronouncing colonel as COL - OH - NELL )  .  His problem is therefore at the level of the speech output lexicon .

I have gone into such detail about individual patients to try to convince you first ,  that it can be misleading to categorize patients too narrowly into groups ,  and second ,  that the dual - route model I described can accommodate a wide variety of data from different individual cases .  There is an equally important additional point that I want to make .  Since brain damage can produce these very precise <head>differences</head> between patients , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there is one part of the brain that has the precise function of carrying out each piece of information processing that is specified within the cognitive model . It seems to me to be perverse in the extreme to attempt to resist the claim that the brain is literally carrying out these functions .  Cognitive neuropsychology thus provides powerful evidence that the level of analysis which functionalists use to describe brain processes is the correct one .

The lack of explanatory force of neurophysiological and psychophysical observations is explicitly admitted by some scientists .  It has been well expressed by the biologist Richard Dawkins :  The sensation of seeing is for us very different from the sensation of hearing , but this cannot be directly due to the physical <head>differences</head> between light and sound . Both light and sound are ,  after all ,  translated by the respective sense organs into the same kind of nerve impulse .

Mimed dance and danced mime  However ,  the strict division of a ballet into four distinct kinds was eliminated by Fokine when he totally cut the scne d'action  from his first ballets and never replaced them .  Instead , he used what he called mimed dance or danced mime , insisting , when asked fur an explanation , that there was a subtle <head>difference</head> between them , only one of degree . To Fokine ,  Les Sylphides  was mimed dance because he had incorporated a few conventional gestures into his choreography .  Fokine said that every phrase of his dance was a gesture ,  and explained :  Undoubtedly an arabesque  has many meanings but only when it appears as an idealised gesture .

The scenes between Hilarion ,  Giselle ,  Albrecht and Bathilde are reminiscent of the scenes that develop Tybalt 's  hatred of Romeo from the first fight between Montague and Capulet to his discovery of Romeo with Juliet after their first meeting at the ball ,  and finally to the fight that ends in Tybalt 's  death .  These scenes heighten the tension and suggest that all will end in tragedy .  Despite the great <head>differences</head> in style between the above three ballets and despite their different libretti the three choreographers perrot ( with Saint - Georges ) , MacMillan and Ashton give valid reasons why the tragic deaths of Giselle , Romeo and Juliet , and Natalia 's lost love are the inevitable result of what has gone before . In other words ,  what happens at the beginning of the story states why the relationships between two or more characters lead to confrontations which continue onwards to a climax and finally draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion .  This last task is possibly the most difficult because the audience must be convinced that the ending chosen is the only possible outcome of everything that has gone before .

The events and circumstances surrounding such plots are difficult to control and organise because the characters are supposedly living in the real world .  So the choreographer cannot make strong contrasts between the style usually used for the other - worldly spirits and that used for the characters living in the particular setting .  He can only highlight the atmosphere supporting the plot , especially those circumstances where he has to portray <head>differences</head> between classes and thus general behaviour , idiosyncrasies , etc. , for example the contrast that must be made between the dances for all and sundry in the town square and those for the aristocrats in the ballroom of Romeo and Juliet . Nevertheless every choreographer creating this kind of romantic ballet today has to spend much time creating the proper gestures to replace the words ,  which in such ballets are never spoken but must be understood .  If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the characters they play .

Natural emotional expression Because the characters of A Month in the Country ,  Enigma Variations ,  Romeo and  Juliet ,  The Invitation  and Mayerling  are supposedly living in a real world ,  the choreographers have no need to make many deliberate contrasts in the style of dance .  Certainly there is a <head>difference</head> between classes when , fur example , the Tutor dances first with Katia the servant , and then with Natalia in A Month in the Country or when townspeople dance in the street and nobles in the ballroom in Romeo and Juliet . Nevertheless much more attention has to be given to the ports de bras  of all types of character in such ballets because these supply the words not spoken in dance .  lf the ports de bras  are to be convincing ,  choreographers need to study Natural Emotional Expression .

As an additional benefit ,  the closed magnetic circuit of a toroidal core greatly reduces the drive requirements to produce saturation levels ,  simplifying the circuitry need by the system .  It may be felt that replacing two straight cores with a ring structure is too drastic a change to gloss over ,  but the mechanism is not too different in the two cases .  Figure 9 represents the way in which the lines of force are concentrated from the immediate vicinity and makes plausible the idea that an overwound coil would not see much <head>difference</head> in the flux changes it experiences from either system . An additional advantage of the ring core is that it will accept more than one overwound pickup coil and they have different orientations to the external magnetic field .  For example while the coil orientation shown in Fig. 10a produces the largest output ,  that 10b links none of the changing flux and has a null output .

In certain respects ,  what Hawkes calls the New New Criticism had what looked like connections with the older version .

This assumption ignored great <head>differences</head> in contextual forms of life and conceptual foundation . Nevertheless ,  Lodge was able to use classical structuralism and aspects of Russian Formalism to refine and extend the existing approaches of formalist criticism .  Resemblances were apparent between Northrop Frye 's  system of archetypes and structuralism ;  indeed ,  Hawkes refers ,  without qualification ,  to Frye 's  Anatomy of Criticism  as a classic of North American structuralism .

Hawkes ,  in turn ,  gave the book a mockingly dismissive review in the TLS  ,  without mentioning Nuttall 's  accusation against him. Nuttall ,  like Thurley ,  writes with a polemical edge ,  but both of them present their cases in a seriously philosophical fashion .  What emerges from recent counter - theory is that French - inspired theory tends to destroy straw men in its attack on reference , insisting that the relation between words and meaning is entirely arbitrary , a matter of <head>difference</head> only . The point has been frequently made that there is no necessary reason why dog should mean the familiar ,  faithful ,  barking ,  domestic quadruped ,  which in other languages ,  gets referred to as chien ,  Hund ,  cane  ,  etc. And within the language - system of English ,  the sounds and letters of d - o - g are recognizable as such simply because they are not d - i - g ,  or d - o - n ,  or l - o - g .

Scholes , however , believes that Saussure is himself inconsistent , and responsible for later confusion , but the thrust of his argument is very close to Tallis 's , and both of them are concerned as were Thurley and Nuttall to reinstate the validity of reference and to deny that language is a system of pure <head>differences</head> , without relation to reality . Scholes provides a useful table ,  divided into three columns ,  showing how linguists and philosophers have agreed in making a tripartite division between signifier ,  signified ,  and reference ,  though they present it in a variety of terminologies .

In principle it would be quite possible for the study of English poetry to begin in a similar ab initio  fashion ,  except that it would be fruitless for someone to embark on it who did not have at least some familiarity with poetry and a wish to read more .  This is because the study of poetry as  poetry  rather than as historical or cultural material  is a matter of intuitive and affective response ,  not just of willingness to accept an intellectual discipline ,  as might be the case with philosophy ,  economics ,  and so forth .  ( I grant that the <head>difference</head> is not absolute , and there may be elements of the affective and the intuitive in the pursuit of any intellectual discipline , but they are likely to be marginal . ) It could be a rewarding form of teaching to help an uninformed but well - motivated student to come to terms with poetry ,  but it would involve time and leisure .  The student would need to read as widely as possible in different kinds of poetry ,  to learn something about literary history ,  genre ,  and convention ,  and to acquire the practical - critical skills of close reading .

Raymond Williams came to think that a splitting of the discipline was increasingly likely ,  since cultural materialism and radical semiotics were not compatible with the dominant paradigm of literary study :  For these necessarily include the paradigm itself as a matter for analysis ,  rather than as a governing definition of the object of knowledge .  In this situation ,  the question had to be raised :  can a radically different work still be carried on under a single heading or department when there is not just diversity of approach but more serious and fundamental <head>differences</head> about the object of knowledge ( despite overlapping of the actual material of study ) ? For reasons which are much more pragmatic than ideological ,  I have come to think that a separation of Cultural Studies from English ,  though not easy ,  would be the least damaging way forward for both parties .

Newbolt 's  attitude is still very common  not only among the British   ( especially those who have come under the influence of F. R.

Whether they know it or not ,  they are in fact endorsing Henry Newbolt against Pound !  All the same , there is by and large a crucial <head>difference</head> here between British and American attitudes , and one that is today every bit as marked as it was in 1912 . For on nearly every American campus there is an atelier  in the shape of a Creative Writing programme ,  whereas on no British campus is there any such thing ,  and indeed the British scoff at the mere possibility  on precisely the grounds that Newbolt here puts forward .  Pound 's  exasperated bewilderment before the spectacle of British loyalty to the amateur ,  and British readiness to pay the price in tolerance of the amateurish ,  is nowhere so evident as in his lifelong esteem for Laurence Binyon ,  the editor of the Hewlett Letters  .

This is what Pound could never have said .  When ,  infrequently ,  he wanted to write in some simple metre ,  he did so ;  but when more often he wanted to get away from standard metres ,  he left them behind altogether ,  no ghost of them lurking behind his arras .  The <head>difference</head> between the two poets corresponds ( not quite exactly , because the nature and history of French verse differs so greatly from English ) to the distinction that the French make between vers libre and vers libr ; between , we may say , free verse and freed verse . Eliot 's  practice ,  as his remarks just quoted make clear ,  was always freed verse :  verse freed indeed from the constraints of traditional prosody ,  yet rather constantly recalling to the reader 's  ear one of the traditional patterns it was departing from .  ( Hence ,  notably in Gerontion ,  Eliot 's  ability to approximate and even conform to Jacobean blank verse ,  yet to depart from it smoothly when he pleased .  )  Pound 's  verse on the contrary was ,  at least after Homage to Sextus Propertius  ,  free ,  not freed :  the rhythms that he sought and attained either had never appeared before in the language ,  or else had not appeared there for many centuries .

Thus Pound was quite ready ,  and became eager ,  to deliver a message ,  though with more obliquities and delays than the impatiently moralistic reader could see reason for ;  whereas Eliot ,  true to his inheritance from French symbolisme  ,  was sceptical and chary of conveying in poetry any message at all .  ( Pound had studied some of the same French poets ,  notably Laforgue and Rimbaud ,  but he had profited by them in a quite different way from Eliot ,  and he was averse to the central thrust of the symboliste  endeavour ,  to which indeed the imagist or imagiste  movement which he had sponsored had been intended as a challenging alternative .  )  The <head>difference</head> between the two of them showed up in The Waste , Land drafts . For among the rather few objections by Pound that Eliot paid no attention to were one or two which would have required him to make consistent ,  in terms of locality and historical period ,  some of his references to London life .  Eliot seems to have ignored these suggestions because for him the physical and social landscape of London was no more than a screen on which to project a phantasmagoria that expressed his own personal disorders and desperations  ( partly sexual ,  as one might expect ,  and as the drafts make clear )  ;  whereas Pound seems to have supposed that the subject of the poem was London in all its historical and geographical actuality ,  much as the city of Dublin was from one point of view the subject of Joyce 's  Ulysses  .

Having devoted most of his political life to touring constituencies and union branches ,  he has barely needed to campaign for the constituency section of the executive over the past two months .  When Mr Prescott first backed off standing against Roy Hattersley for the deputy leadership last year ,  and then changed his mind and decided to contest it after all ,  Neil Kinnock expressed unrestrained irritation .  But the pair , openly hostile by the end of last year , will patch up their mutual <head>differences</head> . Mr Kinnock will want Mr Prescott 's  national executive support  and may sometimes even need his constructive criticism .  Mr Prescott is unquestionably closer to a large swathe of the rank and file than most other members of Labour 's  Shadow Cabinet .

Being charitable ,  this could be considered ongoing profit ,  but what is to be made of Sandhurst Marketing ?  Tootal bought Sandhurst in 1986 for 21.7m ,  and sold it in July for a mere 4.38m .

Sandhurst ,  which has performed dreadfully under Tootal 's  control ,  made a 2m loss up to the point when WH Smith was persuaded to buy it ,  and three out of the four ongoing Tootal businesses showed disappointing results .  The exception was clothing ,  which bucked the trend of the rest of the UK textile industry partly because it supplies Marks  Spencer ,  and partly because it makes very little in the UK .

The message behind the report is that the majority of parents has got it all wrong .  The research ,  carried out over 30 years by the joint directors of the Child Development Research Unit at Nottingham University ,  shows that two - thirds of babies are smacked before the age of one ,  that three - quarters of four - year - olds are smacked once a week or more ,  and that by the age of seven ,  22 per cent have been hit with implements .  By the age of seven , <head>differences</head> between boys and girls have emerged , with boys being more likely to be smacked once a week than girls .

Perhaps it is not possible to produce Peter Shaffer 's  1964 play about the conquest of Peru in a way that is informed by our subsequently increased awareness of how such representation works .  But in wondering it is interesting to compare a much more recent success ,  David Henry Hwang 's  M Butterfly .  Hwang 's devotion to theatrical effects suggests that he shares Shaffer 's belief that peacockery is one of the dramatist 's obligations , and both plays concern an effort at a human relationship across cultural <head>difference</head> : Pizarro 's fascination with the defeated Inca god - king Atahuallpa , and Gallimard 's desire for his Butterfly . But whereas in M Butterfly the theatrical flash and illusion is entirely implicated in the theme of the representation and misrecognition of one culture by another ,  in The Royal Hunt of the Sun ,  at least in this revival ,  it has no such purpose .  If anything ,  Tim Pigott - Smith 's  touring Compass production accentuates the way that the Inca are conceived in European terms .

Constituency Labour Party and trade union delegates seized eagerly on the common feeling that the Conservatives economic and political trials ,  and the disarray of the centre parties ,  were at last combining to open a window of opportunity .

A modest pile of six or seven tomatoes costs about 10 or ten pence depending on your calculation ,  while a pound of meat easily wipes out a month 's  salary .  But salaries are largely irrelevant in Angola ,  because there is so much money and so few things to buy .

Reserve police in the RUC wear the same uniform ,  for all that an outsider can distinguish ,  and as a consequence face the same security risks ,  but most are marginalized by the restricted range of duties they perform and the short - term status of their contract .  Part - time male reservists do only sanger  ( guard )  duty ,  either at the station or at other locations ;  female reservists are restricted in the main to the guard room inside the station ,  with only full - time reserve policemen carrying the responsibility for a broader range of tasks ,  although few are involved in the paperwork for a case file .  But the tasks of reserve police vary across sections and stations , and in some rural areas there is no <head>difference</head> in their responsibilities compared to regular policemen , knowledge of which makes part - time reserve police in Easton very sensitive to their lowly position within the police bureaucracy . Full - time reserve police on the whole are people who are disqualified from entering the regular force as a result of age ,  height ,  or physical health .  A few are trying out policing by joining the reserves first ,  although the common view amongst the reserve police is that it is harder for them to transfer to the regulars than it is for someone without experience to sign up straight away because of the greater number of reasons the police authorities are thereby given for turning them down.

The few females there are in senior management seem to endorse this .  A senior female officer explained to an assembly of policewomen who were being trained in how to operate a casualty bureau that they were better suited to operating the telephones because of their good manners and compassionate nature  ( FN 29/5/87 ,  p. 2 )  .  In talking to ordinary policewomen , we found many themselves adopt notions of gender <head>differences</head> in order to explain the marginalization of their duties , although others prefer this kind of work simply because it makes it easier to manage their difficult and conflicting roles as policewoman , wife , and mother . That is ,  transfers are fewer for those in administrative posts and in specialist sex abuse units ,  and the hours of work are less disruptive to home life .  Yet others rebel against this marginalization and demand both the right to perform the full range of police work  ( from which follows the wish to carry guns )  and that men should become more involved in dealing with child and female offences .

In the 1960s ,  Hoover was looking to increase the output of its manufacturing plant closer to its capacity level and so intended to boost its sales in mainland Europe .  Market research showed considerable <head>differences</head> in consumer preferences in various countries . These are summarised below .   Hoover concluded that consumer preferences must be met by providing models for national markets that incorporated the specific features market research had brought to light .

However ,  whilst this method of comparison relies on easily available information ,  it is not exact ;  exchange rates relate to goods which are traded internationally ,  whilst the the majority of the national product of most countries is comprised of goods which never enter the international marketplace .  The differences in real income can thus be distorted .  As just one example , agricultural goods are generally priced lower in relation to industrial products in developing countries than in industrial countries , and this may lead to an exaggeration of the apparent <head>differences</head> in per capita income . Another potentially distorting factor is that whilst average incomes can be compared between one country and another ,  they do not of themselves reveal the true comparable standard of living ,  nor the comparable potential markets for all products .  Developing countries ,  for example ,  consume many of the same goods as industrialised countries ,  but may have little or no expenditure on heating ,  public utilities ,  medicine ,  etc.

Some nations are predominantly tea drinkers ,  others will generally prefer coffee .  Culture influences almost every aspect of the reaction to a particular product  texture ,  colour ,  desire for innovation or respect for tradition and so on .  Although some cultural <head>differences</head> , such as meaning attributed to basic patterns of syntax in otherwise similar communication patterns are difficult to spot , a long list can be compiled of easily identified cultural seperations . More difficult to identify are the basic factors which are common to all human beings ,  but it is in these that the international marketer will be most interested ,  since they provide a basis upon which to market goods in a way which should have broad appeal .  Some cultural universals can be observed from the work of A H Maslow ,  who hypothesised a hierarchy of needs ,  whereby the satisfaction of a lower need will result in its being replaced by a higher need .

It is difficult to compare the perceptions of Labour and Conservative identifiers who read the same paper since the numbers in our sample who read any one paper were low and tended to be drawn predominantly from one party or another .  A breakdown is possible only for large - circulation papers like the Sun  and the Mirror  .  Amongst Mirror readers , there was no <head>difference</head> between Labour and Conservative identifiers in their perception of the Mirror 's anti - Conservative bias , though Conservative Mirror readers were somewhat less likely to detect a pro - Labour bias . Amongst Sun  readers ,  there was little difference between Labour and Conservative identifiers in their perceptions of its anti - Labour ,  pro - Conservative bias .  Both Labour and Conservative   Sun  readers increasingly alleged pro - Conservative bias in the Sun  as the campaign drew to a close .

By contrast , the <head>difference</head> between those who did and did not watch BBC - TV widened : so the effect of television viewing rose from 12 per cent in the Pre - Campaign Wave to 20 per cent in the last fortnight of the campaign .

At any one time there were wide differences of opinion about party chances however .  Some of those <head>differences</head> were relatively unpredictable . It was always fairly difficult to predict differences of opinion about Conservative and Alliance chances .  In the precampaign week ,  Conservative voters were more optimistic about Conservative chances ,  Labour voters about Labour chances ,  and Alliance voters about Alliance chances ;  but the partisan influence   on perceptions of Conservative and Alliance chances was much smaller than on perceptions of Labour chances .

That may be true ,  but in 1987 hostile interviews with Neil Kinnock trying to explain his party 's  defence policy counted as part of the Labour Party 's  coverage .  Coverage of all  kinds can be both favourable and unfavourable  no matter whether politicians are in government or in opposition  and politicians themselves must bear the prime responsibility for ensuring that when they do get access to the media they present their own case well .  There is no <head>difference</head> between government coverage and party coverage in this respect except that government has more initiative in determining the news , which means that it has more opportunity than the opposition to ensure that its coverage is favourable . So long as balance is defined in terms of the quantity of party coverage  and not whether it is favourable or unfavourable  then the only justification for awarding the government extra coverage is that the government represents order ,  stability ,  and legitimate authority ,  which the media has a duty to support .  Those who do not approve the Mobilizing Ideal for the media should not approve extra media time for the government ,  especially near to election time .

Right - wing readers of a right - wing paper were more  likely than left - wing readers of that same paper to claim that their paper was biased towards the right  though a majority of both left -  and right - wing readers typically agreed that their papers were biased and agreed on the direction of that bias .  Instead of reacting against the bias in their chosen paper ,  readers tended  ( at the margin )  to defend their paper  ( if it was biased against their party )  or even to glory in its bias  ( if it was biased in favour of their party )  .  The <head>difference</head> between public responses to perceptions of bias in the press and on television was reflected in the complex relationship between voters ' allegations of bias and their ratings of the usefulness of the press and television news . Viewers who alleged bias on television tended to give television news lower  marks for usefulness than viewers who perceived no bias on television ;  but readers who alleged bias in their papers tended to give their papers higher  marks for usefulness than readers who perceived no bias in their paper  ( Chapter 6 )  .  Overall ,  although readers were well aware that their papers were relatively biased compared to television and although they rated television as much more useful for providing information about issues ,  they did not  rate television much more useful in helping them decide how to vote .

These do not concern us for Kursk guberniia ,  which was almost exclusively Great Russian and Orthodox ,  but the traditional independence of the Old Believer elements in the Siberian peasantry must not be forgotten .

Does an English liking for watercolour spring from the country 's  climate ?  Does the flat landscape of the Netherlands impose a special sort of vision on Dutch artists ?  The reverse of the coin is internationalism , a feature , some might say , of twentieth - century art ; not so uncommon either in other periods , where art historians struggle heroically to identify <head>differences</head> between the art of one country and another . Some of these struggles have been inspired by base motives  desires to appropriate art to a national or a political cause .  But some such efforts can have sympathy ,  as in those stirrings of national spirit in central Europe before 1914 ,  when literature ,  language and music were fuel for Czech ,  Polish or Hungarian aspirations .

Dictionaries describe a monograph as an account of a single subject ;  by this definition monographs make up one of the most common categories of art publishing .  A book on a single painter ,  for example ,  is a monograph .  There is some doubt in a grey area of <head>differences</head> between monographs on the one hand , and catalogues or biographies on the other. For convenience ,  biographies will be included in the present chapter ,  while catalogues will be treated in the next .  There is a boom in publishing books about individual artists ,  especially those who are already well known .

Max Friedlander ,  an outstanding scholar of Northern European art ,  took the view that accepting a work into an artist 's  oeuvre was like recognising a friend ,  not a matter of measurement or detailed scrutiny .  The reader is thus relying on Friedlander 's  eye .  A <head>difference</head> between Morelli and Friedlander is that the former explains his method , while the latter does not. More than a hundred years have passed since Morelli started writing ;  in that time many problems of authorship have been solved ,  while about others tacit agreement has been reached .  The results of this process can be read in detail in catalogues raisonns ,  which often give a blow - by - blow account of the arguments of scholars over the years .

A case of unwitting collusion by a critic in a manoeuvre by an art  dealer occurred in 1961 ,  when Leo Steinberg wrote an article about Jasper Johns .  Johns was a puzzling phenomenon for Steinberg ,  as one of the artists of Pop Art ,  then hardly begun .  The article appeared in an Italian magazine Metro , who had intended to pay 300 for an article ; but when Johns ' dealer , Leo Castelli , knew that Steinberg was considering an article , he arranged for the magazine to offer 1,000 , paying the <head>difference</head> of 700 himself . Steinberg knew nothing about it .  The underlying question for a reader of criticism is what influences are exerted on the critic ;  but as in this instance ,  for long it may be impossible to know the truth .

It is not altogether satisfactory to call a print by an artist on the same theme as one of his paintings a description .  After all ,  it is an original work in itself .  Nevertheless , the <head>differences</head> between painting and print may be instructive , and help the interpretation of both . By other forms of reproduction an image may be more or less degraded ,  so that nothing can be learnt from them .  There remains the courtesy paid by one art to another ,  as in the poem which Baudelaire suggested might be a high form of critical writing .

Hardship and discontent may declare themselves there ,  in a victim 's  revenge .  In addressing itself to such possibilities ,  however ,  A Bend in the River  ,  for all its air of simplicity ,  is never simple .  Its narrator and chief human presence is by no means straightforwardly a victim , and the <head>difference</head> between oppressor and oppressed can be hard to identify . The novel is narrated by a Moslem of Indian origin ,  whose family has been settled on the east coast of Africa ,  as traders .  Salim leaves them ,  takes off on the first of a series of flights ,  and treks to the interior ,  to a country which appears to be compounded of the Congo and of Uganda ,  in order to earn a living from a store which he has acquired from a man whose daughter he is expected to marry one day .

Kapuscinski is a seeker of general truths who is sparing with his generalisations ,  and who likes certain kinds of particularity but not others .  The kind he likes he calls detail ,  as opposed to long shots  the equivalent ,  that is ,  of the long shots over - used by cameramen of the Iranian Revolution :  it is through details that everything can be shown  that truth can be shown .  But in The Emperor no detail is adduced that might bring out what <head>differences</head> there could have been between the courtiers and petitioners of Ethiopia and their counterparts elsewhere in the world . Kapuscinski 's  courtiers and petitioners are about as black as Johnson 's  Prince Rasselas ,  who is about as black as he is white .

The <head>difference</head> yields a political meaning , in other words , and it would also appear to relate to the old theory of the difference between an author who tells and an author who shows , and who employs a medley of voices in order to do so . It is a distinction which may in the end prove more suggestive than serviceable :  the author who tells ,  and who can be accounted something of a ventriloquist ,  may well ,  for instance ,  be more than capable of carnival ,  and may even be every bit as plural in his works as his dialogic counterpart .  But it is possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lies at the heart of it may be successfully applied both to some sorts of contemporary author and to some of what went before .

Zuckerman has enabled Roth to deal with the question of the offence he has given to righteous Jews ,  and to come to terms with the rebellious ,  psychedelic ,  philo - Semitic Sixties ,  when Roth 's  writing went ,  with the times ,  derisive and fantastic .  The Zuckerman books are a medley of <head>differences</head> and affinities between what we are able to infer about Roth 's life and what he has made of it in art . In propria persona  ,  Roth discourses in The Facts  about his relationship with his younger brother ,  Sandy .  The tone is judicious and kind .

Levi 's  double life as chemist and writer suggests that if art and work need to be separated ,  according to a certain sense of what it is to be a Jew ,  art and work are nevertheless very often the same .  I like to think that he would have accepted that art is work ,  that the work that frees us ,  and is not just punishment ,  is art ,  and that anyone who uses his imagination is an artist .  The categorical <head>difference</head> of the modern world , between artists and others , does not come well out of his reports . His chemistry is intriguing from this point of view .

Everyone who wants to act professionally should try to see as much drama as they possibly can  and this means in the broadest sense ,  watching television ,  cinema ,  visiting the theatre and looking at the actor 's  work carefully and analytically .  It is also important that you try and evaluate the dramatic  experience of these different forms of presentation  this is worthwhile ,  because it will make you think about the different ways in which an actor can work and the various ways in which his skills are used .  Clearly , there is a <head>difference</head> in scale and dimension between the stage , the television screen and the cinema screen , which demand changes in direction and in acting technique . One of the things you will notice when watching the television is that close - ups are used very effectively ,  and so it is of vital importance that the actor has absolute control over his/her face and expression .  You should also look at the ways in which the physical movements of the actor are organised to suit the restraints of the small screen .

This is not unnatural ,  as in the 1970s and early 1980s Spencer was at the Queen 's  University ,  Belfast ,  and an active member of the All Children Together Movement .  Support for this line of approach has been found in Greeley and Rossi 's   ( 1966 )  survey in the USA on the effectiveness of catholic schools .  Based on statistical data for Roman catholics educated in both Roman catholic and other schools , Greeley and Rossi noted as one of their findings that there was little <head>difference</head> in adult religious practice between the two groups . There was a group among former Roman catholic school pupils who exhibited a more intense level of practice ,  but these were also children of fervent Roman catholics .  The causal inference adopted by Greeley and Rossi was that Roman catholic schools only had a clearly identifiable and reinforcing effect on the belief and practice of this group .

This is something  for which surveys ,  including that of Greeley and Rossi ,  are not and cannot be intended .  Another point worth bearing in mind is the very generalizing character of Greeley and Rossi 's  studies .  There was nothing in the studies on the <head>differences</head> between individual catholic schools , either in terms of pupil experiences or the varieties of educational practice and personnel in each school . A black - box approach to the schooling process was used with no direct investigation of processes within the schools .  Finally ,  while it could be argued that Greeley and Rossi tell us something of catholic versus state schooling in the US ,  they have nothing to tell us about catholic versus Christian ,  multi - denominational schools ,  which is what most of the argument in Ireland is about .

The fact that a wide number of manufacturers work to the same pattern means that the caterer who is topping up need not return to the same source for the top - up.

There will be some <head>differences</head> , but they may be too slight to be noticed by the customers , who would normally see only one piece of each item in any case .

In times past ,  I had tried to get across to the continent as much as possible ,  but now ,  while other people were going abroad for the first time because of all the cheap travel around ,  I was  ( without intending to be anti - social )  doing exactly the opposite and taking a look around the British Isles .  All this did ,  of course ,  cost money ,  but  if you 've had even a comparatively small amount of that and then lost it ,  you do tend to realize how transient the whole thing is and not worry so much about getting it back again .  Besides , I did n't think I could now save enough to make a significant <head>difference</head> to my standard of living when I retired , so I decided I might as well enjoy it while I had the chance . In retrospect ,  I would probably have saved a little bit more ,  but there it is  I did manage to save a little bit anyway .  I had been employed at Jersey House for about two and a half years when I was approached to see if I might like to do a little cleaning work to earn some overtime .

This means concentrating on the tow and only taking your eyes off the towplane for a brief moment .  Rope breaks usually occur through inattention and getting badly out of position .  They are probably almost as rare as engine failures , but there is one important <head>difference</head> . With a rope break ,  the climb out is at the normal towing speed when the rope breaks ,  whereas when engine problems occur the tow is usually slow and the climb is far worse than normal .  If the rope breaks ,  the take off field should be within easy reach for a downwind landing ,  whereas a problem with the towplane 's  engine usually means a field landing is almost inevitable .

the report is certainly not a definitive and unchallengeable portrait of the Metropolitan police .

There is a world of <head>difference</head> between research findings based on safe academic principles and methodology , and those produced with graphic literary phrases , but based upon anecdotal heresay , recorded by listeners blessed with total recall . This attack was repeated again in 1987 in the Federation magazine ,  for the report had obviously hit a very raw nerve .  Its frenzied rejection was very different to that of the many projects listed in the Police Foundation or Home Office Registers of Research mentioned above ,  most of which are simply ignored and never ever receive any review .

Barrie Irving ,  the Police Foundation director has presented a paper today outlining research into the Police and Criminal Evidence Act  ( PACE )  .  Having some 1979 data on custody practices and prisoner interviews he sought to replicate the study in 1986/7 to assess the influence of the legislation on police practice .  Claiming significant <head>differences</head> in post - PACE activities he suggested these showed the need for legal measures to impact upon police practice and influence change . His observational sample of prisoner interviews ,  although small ,  had found the PACE codes of practice were followed to the letter and he argued this showed that it required the sanction of the law to effect changes in interview and interrogation techniques .  A detective inspector shrugged this off ,  arguing from practical mastery and insider 's  knowledge ,  that the practices of doing the business remained undisturbed outside of the PACE interview .

I was then asked : what 's the <head>difference</head> between a law course at polytechnic and at the university ? This assumption that policemen study law becomes axiomatic .  As Smith  ( ibid .  )  indicates ,  the cost of one scholarship  ( when he was writing in 1978 )  was about 30,000 and by the late 1980s this had risen to well over 100,000 .

I would enter a plea that I have often made that the street officer 's  authority and discretion should be given better recognition .  It has always seemed to me rather sad that almost any move from beat duty is regarded as a promotion .  Such a plea , although laudable , has little chance of becoming reality in the present organizational set - up , for it ignores the semantic <head>difference</head> in the uniformed polis 's role and that of the 1015 per cent of the institution who form the lite in the CID . For the uniformed wollies at the bottom of the hierarchical pile ,  any move  into detective work can have parallels with a marginal movement .  It becomes a rite of separation into an area where the detective 's  need to juggle with statistics and detection rates is diametrically opposed to the constantly voiced uniform preference for action which is simply programmed to nail the prig down.

It is the world of ESSO men  ( Every Saturday and Sunday Off )  ,  and the real polis 's  scorn is reflected in some of the language of definition which I have outlined here .  Now ,  as a consequence of my eight marginal years on a drug  squad ,  visits to the United Nations ,  and the three years at university reading a subject which few knew anything about ,  but would be willing to dismiss along with all of the social sciences ,  I was in danger of being irrevocably cast into the mould of being a college man or academic .  I was close to being one of them and definitely not one of us because of an acquired list of significant <head>differences</head> . Given that the police are essentially an organization constrained by an ingrained respect for the pragmatism of action  regardless of the lip - service paid to the police college ,  the special course ,  or the university scholarship  it was inevitable that the hierarchy would follow the dictates of institutional philosophy and pull the marginal mover in from the periphery ;  for there is a boundary beyond which the pilgrim cannot be allowed to stray .  In all the legends or tales of the journey to individuation and knowledge ,  the liminal mover always returns to the centre and is reconstituted into structure .

( Professor Dudek has demonstrated that from a base of only 1.7 per cent of the population ,  the input in terms of literature and art amounts to a staggering 25 per cent .  )  Montreal is an unusual city ,  made up of 50 villages which have grown and merged together over the years to form the modern conurbation :  about 100 square kilometres in size  ( 60 square miles )  ,  encircled by the St. Lawrence River .  The various groups keep a fairly sharp <head>difference</head> between them , centering their activities , not least through the exigencies of the two languages , in their own areas : essentially in the East ( French ) and West ( English which includes the large Scottish and other cultural elements ) .

Here this very affluent neighbourhood spreads out southwards and westwards from the Mont Royale ,  after which the city is named .

Within the mode of knowledge framework ,  the feel will be explained by the special mode of access to one 's  own  brain .  That this will not do is what I have just argued .  The second response , that the <head>difference</head> consists solely and simply in a mode of knowledge of the external world , without invoking any internal and introspectible feel , requires one to explain perceptual experiences with different modes of access without reference to a subjective component . As far as I can see ,  the only way to do this is to adopt a behaviouristic approach to this knowledge and characterize it as an ability to discriminate visual objects .  To take this road is to resort to what I earlier described as the most primitive physicalist response to the problem ,  which involves denying that there is anything about the nature of experience that BS does not know .

It is the content specifically of sense - perception that must be taken non - reductively ,  if the contrast required by our concept of disposition is to be maintained .  Some philosophers might suspect that I have not considered the behaviouristic theories in their most sophisticated form .  Would it not make a <head>difference</head> if one identified experience , not with some disposition to overt behaviour , but with the behaviour of the brain as it discriminates the various sorts of stimuli within the nervous system ? This is a version of the supposedly post   - behaviourist theory called functionalism ,  which treats mental states as responding to other internal and mental states as well as to external stimuli .  The first thing to notice about functionalism is that it does not fare any better than behaviourism in providing an account of what it is that V knows and BS does not ,  for BS could know all about V 's  functional or covertly behavioural states ;  so there is no lack of knowledge that his deficit could consist in .

Thoughts will be referred to as cognisant acts .  The simplest and most fundamental aspect of cognisance  ( fundamental philosophically and developmentally )  is what is usually referred to as self - world dualism :  the knowledge that there is a physical world out there of which I am an experiencer and that is distinct from me .  Mental development , on the constructivist view , consists in the elaboration of this knowledge ; so that if there is one central <head>difference</head> between the mental processes of the baby , the child , and of the adult it is in terms of how self - world dualism is manifest in ( and to ) the subject . The representational theory of mind treats the explanation of mental life as a kind of engineering problem ;  it starts from the inside  ,  from the representational state ,  and asks how mental states interact with one another to produce something that we would call knowledge ;  the representational theorist proceeds like a sceptical philosopher who thinks that what figures in our mental life is not reality but our mental representations of it  ( recall my saying the Fodor described his position as methodological solipsism )  .  The constructivist starting - point could not be more different ,  and might be said to be biological where the representational theory is engineering  or machinological .

It means that we can think about things that are not present .  Sure enough ,  we would expect the input systems to ensure that the right kinds of distinctions are drawn  between contour changes that define occlusion and those which define disappearance ,  for example  but this surely does not mean that the possessor of these input systems is capable of thinking about unperceived entities .  What this adds up to , then , is the claim that if there existed an organism which either could not act or whose actions made no <head>difference</head> to its perceptions then not only would that organism not be cognisant , it could never become cognisant . ( It is not clear to me whether this is some kind of philosophical claim or an hypothesis .  You may say that it is refutable  and so it is empirical ;  but then  see below  our criteria for cognisance are so much bound up with what the subject can do that it is difficult to see how we could assess the cognisance of a totally passive creature .  )

The point of the experiments was this :  strong social pressure  was being put on these children to agree to a realist answer  ( they were not allowed out of the room until they had an answer !  )  and if their usual tendency to interpret questions phenomenally is a trivial and weak effect then this social pressure should obliterate it .  The result was that the social pressure had no effect at all .  In children between four and eight years of age there was absolutely no <head>difference</head> between the number of realist answers produced by the pairs and by the control , solo children . They knew the realist option but did not take it as a way out of a social impasse ,  because ,  I would argue ,  the phenomenalist tendency of thought is too strong .  What dominated their judgements was the salience of the illusion  that  was most up front in consciousness .

Initially the subject will attend to a new stimulus but will then gradually lose interest and start to look away  ( habituation )  ;  if the stimulus is then changed in some way and if this causes a re - awakening of interest  ( dishabituation )  then we can assume that the baby has detected the change .  Another technique is preferential looking .  If the subject prefers to look at one stimulus rather than another we can assume that he has detected a <head>difference</head> between them . 8 .  This idea had a great influence upon the thinking of Schopenhauer who followed up its implications more thoroughly than did Kant .  9 .

The problem is that it is highly improbable that a group of patients with brain injury constitute a natural kind ,  even when they display similar symptoms on some test or other. This is because no two patients are likely to have identical injuries ,  and large groups of patients are even less likely to be homogenous .  In fact , if you probe deeper , vitally important functional <head>differences</head> between patients will emerge . In amnesia ,  as in many other  so called neuropsychological syndromes  ( developmental dyslexia ,  schizophrenia ,  Wemicke 's  aphasia etcetera )  there is probably no uniform pattern in nature waiting to reveal itself .  What you have are groups of people who display superficially similar symptoms for a variety of different reasons .

It is known as a speech output  system because there is evidence that a quite separate lexicon is involved in speech perception .  A pronunciation is addressed either with or without the mediation of the semantic system  our store of word meanings .  The fundamental <head>difference</head> between the two routes , then , is that a pronunciation is either built up from sublexical components ( assembled phonology ) or looked up as a whole ( addressed phonology ) . This model has been extremely successful in enabling us to understand acquired dyslexia .  Acquired dyslexia involves a loss of reading ability as a result of brain injury .

Moreover ,  a closer look at individual patients provides support for what was said about the heterogeneity of groups at the start of this section .  So ,  the more that surface dyslexics are studied ,  the more it becomes obvious that the condition fractionates ;  there are important differences between individual surface dyslexics .  These <head>differences</head> can also be accommodated by the dual route model . For example ,  one surface dyslexic can accurately define the irregular words that he regularizes in pronunciation tasks  ( for instance ,  pronouncing colonel as COL - OH - NELL )  .  His problem is therefore at the level of the speech output lexicon .

I have gone into such detail about individual patients to try to convince you first ,  that it can be misleading to categorize patients too narrowly into groups ,  and second ,  that the dual - route model I described can accommodate a wide variety of data from different individual cases .  There is an equally important additional point that I want to make .  Since brain damage can produce these very precise <head>differences</head> between patients , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there is one part of the brain that has the precise function of carrying out each piece of information processing that is specified within the cognitive model . It seems to me to be perverse in the extreme to attempt to resist the claim that the brain is literally carrying out these functions .  Cognitive neuropsychology thus provides powerful evidence that the level of analysis which functionalists use to describe brain processes is the correct one .

Fodor  ( 1981 )  provides a very clear description of functionalism ,  and his book The Modularity of Mind  discusses some of the philosophical issues surrounding cognitive neuropsychology .  Pylyshyn ( 1984 ) contains an important account of the relationship between cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence , and Pylyshyn ( 1973 ) contains an interesting discussion of the <head>differences</head> between cognitive science and phenomenology . A very clear introduction to current work in cognitive neuropsychology is provided by Ellis and Young  ( 1988 )  .

The lack of explanatory force of neurophysiological and psychophysical observations is explicitly admitted by some scientists .  It has been well expressed by the biologist Richard Dawkins :  The sensation of seeing is for us very different from the sensation of hearing , but this cannot be directly due to the physical <head>differences</head> between light and sound . Both light and sound are ,  after all ,  translated by the respective sense organs into the same kind of nerve impulse .  It is impossible to tell ,  from the physical attributes of a nerve impulse ,  whether it is conveying information about light ,  about sound or about smell .

It is not directly because of the physical <head>differences</head> between light and sound This is not a very convincing escape from the circularity of the psychophysical laws .

Under the chairmanship of Sir Peter Parker the concept of the commercial railway and the social railway was developed at the end of the 1970s and the start of the 1980s .

These dances mattered very much to Petipa and all nineteenthcentury balletmasters because they were expected to show off the wealth of talent found in the many imperial ,  Royal and State theatres ,  e.g. all the characters from other fairy tales who came to Aurora 's  wedding and the character dances in Swan Lake  .  Mimed dance and danced mime  However ,  the strict division of a ballet into four distinct kinds was eliminated by Fokine when he totally cut the scne d'action  from his first ballets and never replaced them .  Instead , he used what he called mimed dance or danced mime , insisting , when asked fur an explanation , that there was a subtle <head>difference</head> between them , only one of degree . To Fokine ,  Les Sylphides  was mimed dance because he had incorporated a few conventional gestures into his choreography .  Fokine said that every phrase of his dance was a gesture ,  and explained :  Undoubtedly an arabesque  has many meanings but only when it appears as an idealised gesture .

The scenes between Hilarion ,  Giselle ,  Albrecht and Bathilde are reminiscent of the scenes that develop Tybalt 's  hatred of Romeo from the first fight between Montague and Capulet to his discovery of Romeo with Juliet after their first meeting at the ball ,  and finally to the fight that ends in Tybalt 's  death .  These scenes heighten the tension and suggest that all will end in tragedy .  Despite the great <head>differences</head> in style between the above three ballets and despite their different libretti the three choreographers perrot ( with Saint - Georges ) , MacMillan and Ashton give valid reasons why the tragic deaths of Giselle , Romeo and Juliet , and Natalia 's lost love are the inevitable result of what has gone before . In other words ,  what happens at the beginning of the story states why the relationships between two or more characters lead to confrontations which continue onwards to a climax and finally draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion .  This last task is possibly the most difficult because the audience must be convinced that the ending chosen is the only possible outcome of everything that has gone before .

The events and circumstances surrounding such plots are difficult to control and organise because the characters are supposedly living in the real world .  So the choreographer cannot make strong contrasts between the style usually used for the other - worldly spirits and that used for the characters living in the particular setting .  He can only highlight the atmosphere supporting the plot , especially those circumstances where he has to portray <head>differences</head> between classes and thus general behaviour , idiosyncrasies , etc. , for example the contrast that must be made between the dances for all and sundry in the town square and those for the aristocrats in the ballroom of Romeo and Juliet . Nevertheless every choreographer creating this kind of romantic ballet today has to spend much time creating the proper gestures to replace the words ,  which in such ballets are never spoken but must be understood .  If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the characters they play .

Natural emotional expression Because the characters of A Month in the Country ,  Enigma Variations ,  Romeo and  Juliet ,  The Invitation  and Mayerling  are supposedly living in a real world ,  the choreographers have no need to make many deliberate contrasts in the style of dance .  Certainly there is a <head>difference</head> between classes when , fur example , the Tutor dances first with Katia the servant , and then with Natalia in A Month in the Country or when townspeople dance in the street and nobles in the ballroom in Romeo and Juliet .

In some older dances they each hold a corner of a handkerchief to form a link and in some areas they link little fingers .

For all their liveliness of style any of the above national dances seen in one ballet resemble those in another because choreographers such as Petipa ,  Bournonville and Saint - Lon utilised the same steps and ports de bras  again and again .  Only the music created slight differences and this not markedly because the composers used the best of commonly recognised traditional musical idioms .

The epileptic makes a neat reply ,  again touching life and art simultaneously :  the author and hero of The Idiot  .

The criticism of Turgenev is only incidentally that he is stuck in the 1840s and not far - sighted enough .  New - sightedness ,  the timeless standpoint ,  hitherto unknown reality  these have an air of mystical hubris when dragged  into the open ,  but they are what Dostoevsky is really talking about .

As an additional benefit ,  the closed magnetic circuit of a toroidal core greatly reduces the drive requirements to produce saturation levels ,  simplifying the circuitry need by the system .  It may be felt that replacing two straight cores with a ring structure is too drastic a change to gloss over ,  but the mechanism is not too different in the two cases .  Figure 9 represents the way in which the lines of force are concentrated from the immediate vicinity and makes plausible the idea that an overwound coil would not see much <head>difference</head> in the flux changes it experiences from either system . An additional advantage of the ring core is that it will accept more than one overwound pickup coil and they have different orientations to the external magnetic field .  For example while the coil orientation shown in Fig. 10a produces the largest output ,  that 10b links none of the changing flux and has a null output .

In certain respects ,  what Hawkes calls the New New Criticism had what looked like connections with the older version .  Both were directed towards the formalist reading of literary texts ,  and some anglophone academics tried to minimize the strangeness of French imports by saying that la nouvelle critique  was only offering a new version of what had long been familiar in the Anglo - American academy .  This assumption ignored great <head>differences</head> in contextual forms of life and conceptual foundation . Nevertheless ,  Lodge was able to use classical structuralism and aspects of Russian Formalism to refine and extend the existing approaches of formalist criticism .  Resemblances were apparent between Northrop Frye 's  system of archetypes and structuralism ;  indeed ,  Hawkes refers ,  without qualification ,  to Frye 's  Anatomy of Criticism  as a classic of North American structuralism .

Hawkes ,  in turn ,  gave the book a mockingly dismissive review in the TLS  ,  without mentioning Nuttall 's  accusation against him. Nuttall ,  like Thurley ,  writes with a polemical edge ,  but both of them present their cases in a seriously philosophical fashion .  What emerges from recent counter - theory is that French - inspired theory tends to destroy straw men in its attack on reference , insisting that the relation between words and meaning is entirely arbitrary , a matter of <head>difference</head> only . The point has been frequently made that there is no necessary reason why dog should mean the familiar ,  faithful ,  barking ,  domestic quadruped ,  which in other languages ,  gets referred to as chien ,  Hund ,  cane  ,  etc. And within the language - system of English ,  the sounds and letters of d - o - g are recognizable as such simply because they are not d - i - g ,  or d - o - n ,  or l - o - g .

He did not intend to exclude  reality .  The error lies with Saussure 's  expositors .  Scholes , however , believes that Saussure is himself inconsistent , and responsible for later confusion , but the thrust of his argument is very close to Tallis 's , and both of them are concerned as were Thurley and Nuttall to reinstate the validity of reference and to deny that language is a system of pure <head>differences</head> , without relation to reality . Scholes provides a useful table ,  divided into three columns ,  showing how linguists and philosophers have agreed in making a tripartite division between signifier ,  signified ,  and reference ,  though they present it in a variety of terminologies .  For Frege ,  it was Expression ,  Sense ,  Reference  (  Ausdruck ,  Sinn ,  Bedeutung )   .

In principle it would be quite possible for the study of English poetry to begin in a similar ab initio  fashion ,  except that it would be fruitless for someone to embark on it who did not have at least some familiarity with poetry and a wish to read more .  This is because the study of poetry as  poetry  rather than as historical or cultural material  is a matter of intuitive and affective response ,  not just of willingness to accept an intellectual discipline ,  as might be the case with philosophy ,  economics ,  and so forth .  ( I grant that the <head>difference</head> is not absolute , and there may be elements of the affective and the intuitive in the pursuit of any intellectual discipline , but they are likely to be marginal . ) It could be a rewarding form of teaching to help an uninformed but well - motivated student to come to terms with poetry ,  but it would involve time and leisure .  The student would need to read as widely as possible in different kinds of poetry ,  to learn something about literary history ,  genre ,  and convention ,  and to acquire the practical - critical skills of close reading .

Raymond Williams came to think that a splitting of the discipline was increasingly likely ,  since cultural materialism and radical semiotics were not compatible with the dominant paradigm of literary study :  For these necessarily include the paradigm itself as a matter for analysis ,  rather than as a governing definition of the object of knowledge .  In this situation ,  the question had to be raised :  can a radically different work still be carried on under a single heading or department when there is not just diversity of approach but more serious and fundamental <head>differences</head> about the object of knowledge ( despite overlapping of the actual material of study ) ? For reasons which are much more pragmatic than ideological ,  I have come to think that a separation of Cultural Studies from English ,  though not easy ,  would be the least damaging way forward for both parties .  It would represent a realignment within the humanities ,  not a diminution of them .

Newbolt 's  attitude is still very common  not only among the British   ( especially those who have come under the influence of F. R. Leavis )  ,  but also among American free versifiers who think they are an avantgarde and who are muddled enough to think that they have Pound 's  authority to back them .  Whether they know it or not ,  they are in fact endorsing Henry Newbolt against Pound !  All the same , there is by and large a crucial <head>difference</head> here between British and American attitudes , and one that is today every bit as marked as it was in 1912 . For on nearly every American campus there is an atelier  in the shape of a Creative Writing programme ,  whereas on no British campus is there any such thing ,  and indeed the British scoff at the mere possibility  on precisely the grounds that Newbolt here puts forward .  Pound 's  exasperated bewilderment before the spectacle of British loyalty to the amateur ,  and British readiness to pay the price in tolerance of the amateurish ,  is nowhere so evident as in his lifelong esteem for Laurence Binyon ,  the editor of the Hewlett Letters  .

This is what Pound could never have said .  When ,  infrequently ,  he wanted to write in some simple metre ,  he did so ;  but when more often he wanted to get away from standard metres ,  he left them behind altogether ,  no ghost of them lurking behind his arras .  The <head>difference</head> between the two poets corresponds ( not quite exactly , because the nature and history of French verse differs so greatly from English ) to the distinction that the French make between vers libre and vers libr ; between , we may say , free verse and freed verse . Eliot 's  practice ,  as his remarks just quoted make clear ,  was always freed verse :  verse freed indeed from the constraints of traditional prosody ,  yet rather constantly recalling to the reader 's  ear one of the traditional patterns it was departing from .  ( Hence ,  notably in Gerontion ,  Eliot 's  ability to approximate and even conform to Jacobean blank verse ,  yet to depart from it smoothly when he pleased .  )  Pound 's  verse on the contrary was ,  at least after Homage to Sextus Propertius  ,  free ,  not freed :  the rhythms that he sought and attained either had never appeared before in the language ,  or else had not appeared there for many centuries .

Thus Pound was quite ready ,  and became eager ,  to deliver a message ,  though with more obliquities and delays than the impatiently moralistic reader could see reason for ;  whereas Eliot ,  true to his inheritance from French symbolisme  ,  was sceptical and chary of conveying in poetry any message at all .  ( Pound had studied some of the same French poets ,  notably Laforgue and Rimbaud ,  but he had profited by them in a quite different way from Eliot ,  and he was averse to the central thrust of the symboliste  endeavour ,  to which indeed the imagist or imagiste  movement which he had sponsored had been intended as a challenging alternative .  )  The <head>difference</head> between the two of them showed up in The Waste , Land drafts . For among the rather few objections by Pound that Eliot paid no attention to were one or two which would have required him to make consistent ,  in terms of locality and historical period ,  some of his references to London life .  Eliot seems to have ignored these suggestions because for him the physical and social landscape of London was no more than a screen on which to project a phantasmagoria that expressed his own personal disorders and desperations  ( partly sexual ,  as one might expect ,  and as the drafts make clear )  ;  whereas Pound seems to have supposed that the subject of the poem was London in all its historical and geographical actuality ,  much as the city of Dublin was from one point of view the subject of Joyce 's  Ulysses  .

However , rather than realising a 17m loss , Tootal 's figures show a 3.4m profit , with most of the <head>difference</head> written off earlier through the balance sheet . Sandhurst ,  which has performed dreadfully under Tootal 's  control ,  made a 2m loss up to the point when WH Smith was persuaded to buy it ,  and three out of the four ongoing Tootal businesses showed disappointing results .  The exception was clothing ,  which bucked the trend of the rest of the UK textile industry partly because it supplies Marks  Spencer ,  and partly because it makes very little in the UK .

In a large ,  prefabricated shed we wandered past stacks of 45 - gallon drums of PCBs ,  two drums high ,  about 10 deep ;  and there were contaminated transformers waiting to be cut up and roasted in the flames .  Back along the waste chain ,  the Liverpool dockers who objected to the import of exactly this type of chemical should be aware that PCBs are moving about our roads all the time .  There was no <head>difference</head> between the liquid in these drums and the liquid in the cargoes they refused to touch . In Liverpool ,  a dockers '  spokesman with the Transport and General Workers Union admitted :  Drivers are n't happy handling some of these commodities ,  but at least a lorry - driver has more idea of what he is handling than a docker ,  who could have a consignment and just not know what it is .  Yet he did not oppose all toxic waste movement  ( after all ,  the same union represents workers at Rechem itself )  ;  he simply did n't like the idea that big industrial nations like Canada could dump their dirty problems on this country and his members .

If agreement cannot be reached ,  the banks ,  which include National Westminster and Midland ,  have the power to close the project or bring in fresh management .

The message behind the report is that the majority of parents has got it all wrong .  The research ,  carried out over 30 years by the joint directors of the Child Development Research Unit at Nottingham University ,  shows that two - thirds of babies are smacked before the age of one ,  that three - quarters of four - year - olds are smacked once a week or more ,  and that by the age of seven ,  22 per cent have been hit with implements .  By the age of seven , <head>differences</head> between boys and girls have emerged , with boys being more likely to be smacked once a week than girls . The report has been published by Approach  ( the Association to Protect All Children Ltd )  ,  a new charity linked to Epoch  ( End Physical Punishment of Children )  ,  a national campaign which was launched in April .  When I read the Epoch literature I am always convinced by it .

Perhaps it is not possible to produce Peter Shaffer 's  1964 play about the conquest of Peru in a way that is informed by our subsequently increased awareness of how such representation works .  But in wondering it is interesting to compare a much more recent success ,  David Henry Hwang 's  M Butterfly .  Hwang 's devotion to theatrical effects suggests that he shares Shaffer 's belief that peacockery is one of the dramatist 's obligations , and both plays concern an effort at a human relationship across cultural <head>difference</head> : Pizarro 's fascination with the defeated Inca god - king Atahuallpa , and Gallimard 's desire for his Butterfly . But whereas in M Butterfly the theatrical flash and illusion is entirely implicated in the theme of the representation and misrecognition of one culture by another ,  in The Royal Hunt of the Sun ,  at least in this revival ,  it has no such purpose .  If anything ,  Tim Pigott - Smith 's  touring Compass production accentuates the way that the Inca are conceived in European terms .

One must recognise that these polls take place ,  but also carefully remember that a decision about any vacancy that takes place is taken by my colleagues in the House of Commons ,  and not the general public .  Mr Heseltine also defended Nigel Lawson 's  decision to put interest rates up to 15 per cent ,  and hoped the Chancellor would be given a courteous reception when he addressed conference on Thursday .  But in his interview with The Independent , Mr Heseltine staked out the areas of <head>difference</head> between himself and his front - bench colleagues . On the NHS changes ,  he said he would support the legislation because it was designed to make the service more effective and efficient .  But he then sided with many professional and political critics of the Government 's  plans ,  saying :  Having got the legislation ,  it would be wise to proceed by demonstration of success rather than trying a root - and - branch revolutionary approach .

But Gary Marsh ,  head of research with the Halifax ,  the UK 's  biggest building society ,  says it is inevitable that the modest improvement seen in the market over the last couple of months  especially in the South ,  where sellers have started to adjust to more realistic levels  will be damaged and the date of its recovery put back .

Reserve police in the RUC wear the same uniform ,  for all that an outsider can distinguish ,  and as a consequence face the same security risks ,  but most are marginalized by the restricted range of duties they perform and the short - term status of their contract .  Part - time male reservists do only sanger  ( guard )  duty ,  either at the station or at other locations ;  female reservists are restricted in the main to the guard room inside the station ,  with only full - time reserve policemen carrying the responsibility for a broader range of tasks ,  although few are involved in the paperwork for a case file .  But the tasks of reserve police vary across sections and stations , and in some rural areas there is no <head>difference</head> in their responsibilities compared to regular policemen , knowledge of which makes part - time reserve police in Easton very sensitive to their lowly position within the police bureaucracy . Full - time reserve police on the whole are people who are disqualified from entering the regular force as a result of age ,  height ,  or physical health .  A few are trying out policing by joining the reserves first ,  although the common view amongst the reserve police is that it is harder for them to transfer to the regulars than it is for someone without experience to sign up straight away because of the greater number of reasons the police authorities are thereby given for turning them down.

The few females there are in senior management seem to endorse this .  A senior female officer explained to an assembly of policewomen who were being trained in how to operate a casualty bureau that they were better suited to operating the telephones because of their good manners and compassionate nature  ( FN 29/5/87 ,  p. 2 )  .  In talking to ordinary policewomen , we found many themselves adopt notions of gender <head>differences</head> in order to explain the marginalization of their duties , although others prefer this kind of work simply because it makes it easier to manage their difficult and conflicting roles as policewoman , wife , and mother . That is ,  transfers are fewer for those in administrative posts and in specialist sex abuse units ,  and the hours of work are less disruptive to home life .  Yet others rebel against this marginalization and demand both the right to perform the full range of police work  ( from which follows the wish to carry guns )  and that men should become more involved in dealing with child and female offences .

However ,  whilst this method of comparison relies on easily available information ,  it is not exact ;  exchange rates relate to goods which are traded internationally ,  whilst the the majority of the national product of most countries is comprised of goods which never enter the international marketplace .  The differences in real income can thus be distorted .  As just one example , agricultural goods are generally priced lower in relation to industrial products in developing countries than in industrial countries , and this may lead to an exaggeration of the apparent <head>differences</head> in per capita income . Another potentially distorting factor is that whilst average incomes can be compared between one country and another ,  they do not of themselves reveal the true comparable standard of living ,  nor the comparable potential markets for all products .  Developing countries ,  for example ,  consume many of the same goods as industrialised countries ,  but may have little or no expenditure on heating ,  public utilities ,  medicine ,  etc.

Y = a + b X where Y = demand for a product ,  typically expressed as the number of households per 1,000 of the population that own one of the product  ( a car ,  television ,  video recorder etc )  .  X = an independent variable ,  typically GDP per head or GNP per head of the population .  Demand for the product next year would be calculated from the formula by taking the <head>difference</head> between projected total number owned next year and total number owned currently . The reliability of the statistical estimates can be measured by a coefficient of determination ,  Rs .  For example ,  the ownership of cars per 1,000 of the population might be estimated from historical data as follows .

For example ,  a survey of 1,800 working women in France might show that 38 %  read at least one magazine weekly ,  and a similar survey in West Germany of 940 working women showed that 47 %  of them read at least one magazine weekly .  A t - test would show whether German working women appear to be significantly greater readers of magazines than their French counterparts .  Any significant <head>differences</head> could have implications for the selection of advertising media/overall marketing mix in each country . Cluster analysis .  Cluster analysis is used to group variables ,  objects or individuals into groups or clusters of variables ,  objects or individuals that have certain similarities with each other.

Your turn to keep watch !  At first light the mortaring and sniping started .  The only <head>difference</head> was that the mortar bursts were further away than yesterday , some were even landing in the village . The sniping was still fairly accurate and still concentrated in and around the orchard .  Someone brought me a mess tin half full of very hot tea ;  it tasted good .

At least the new Brigadier served in the Irish Guards and they had Pipers .  I would just have to wait and see .  The capture of the village yesterday evening did not make much <head>difference</head> to our situation in and around the village . The enemy ,  it appears ,  have withdrawn a short distance from the area in front of 6 Commando ,  the front being just the same in front of the other Commando units .  Another mortar team has moved into the orchard this evening ,  13th June ,  and got down to work straight away by sending off several rounds of high explosives in quick succession in the direction of the enemy positions .

The front door was open ,  as we approached ,  a light came on ,  probably from an oil lamp .  I could now smell the very strong aroma of frying onions as we entered the cottage .

It is difficult to compare the perceptions of Labour and Conservative identifiers who read the same paper since the numbers in our sample who read any one paper were low and tended to be drawn predominantly from one party or another .  A breakdown is possible only for large - circulation papers like the Sun  and the Mirror  .  Amongst Mirror readers , there was no <head>difference</head> between Labour and Conservative identifiers in their perception of the Mirror 's anti - Conservative bias , though Conservative Mirror readers were somewhat less likely to detect a pro - Labour bias . Amongst Sun  readers ,  there was little difference between Labour and Conservative identifiers in their perceptions of its anti - Labour ,  pro - Conservative bias .  Both Labour and Conservative   Sun  readers increasingly alleged pro - Conservative bias in the Sun  as the campaign drew to a close .

This chapter uses two techniques to investigate media influence .  To assess the impact of pervasive and consensual television news we can correlate trends in television news content and trends in overall public perceptions .  To assess the impact of more differentiated media sources we can look for <head>differences</head> between their different audiences : differences between readers of highbrow or lowbrow papers , for example , or between readers of right - wing and left - wing papers . THE IMPACT OF A CHANGING TELEVISION CONSENSUS Our analysis of television news content in Chapter 4 showed that controversy reached a peak on television in the third week of the campaign .

But this effect had declined to only 22 per cent by the last fortnight of the campaign .  Similarly ,  readers of lowbrow papers were relatively ill - informed about polls before the campaign but caught up on highbrow readers later :  the effect of reading a highbrow paper declined from 33 per cent in the Pre - Campaign Wave to only 15 per cent in the closing stages of the campaign .  By contrast , the <head>difference</head> between those who did and did not watch BBC - TV widened : so the effect of television viewing rose from 12 per cent in the Pre - Campaign Wave to 20 per cent in the last fortnight of the campaign . Thus ,  as the election approached ,  the basis of public awareness of opinion polls shifted from more personal factors like political interest or choice of paper ,  to more impersonal mobilizing factors like television news .  The kinds of people who were most aware of public opinion polls in the closing stages of the campaign were very different from the kinds of people who were most aware of them in the mid - term  ( Table 7.6 )  .

We have already noted the correlation between overall trends in perceptions of opinion polls and trends in perceptions of party prospects  ( see Table 7.3 )  .  At any one time there were wide differences of opinion about party chances however .  Some of those <head>differences</head> were relatively unpredictable . It was always fairly difficult to predict differences of opinion about Conservative and Alliance chances .  In the precampaign week ,  Conservative voters were more optimistic about Conservative chances ,  Labour voters about Labour chances ,  and Alliance voters about Alliance chances ;  but the partisan influence   on perceptions of Conservative and Alliance chances was much smaller than on perceptions of Labour chances .

A trend analysis confirms these regression findings .  There was always an enormous difference between the economic perceptions of those who initially had Conservative and Labour preferences ,  especially those who described themselves as party supporters .  The <head>difference</head> was largest when their focus was on Britain ( not themselves ) last year ( not next year ) . Irrespective of the focus ,    however ,  the difference widened as the election approached .  Because a majority of Conservative supporters were economic optimists and a majority of Labour supporters were economic pessimists ,  the difference between net optimism amongst Conservative and Labour supporters exceeded 100 per cent :  it was 105 per cent in the Pre - Campaign Wave ,  rising to 121 per cent by the end of the campaign .

Public awareness of opinion polls was most predictable in the Pre - Campaign Wave and became steadily less predictable as the election approached and awareness spread throughout the electorate .  Before the campaign opened the key influence on poll awareness was a generalized interest in politics ,  but as the  campaign drew to an end television viewing became more important .  Before the campaign there was a 41 per cent <head>difference</head> in awareness of polls between those with high and low levels of interest in politics ; but this declined to 22 per cent by the end of the campaign . Readers of lowbrow papers were relatively ill informed about polls before the campaign but caught up with highbrow readers later .  Conversely the difference between those who did and did not watch television widened .

But that is only part of the explanation for the magnitude of their swing to the Conservatives .  The fact that uncommitted voters who read the Sun  or Star  swung so much more than other uncommitted voters  suggests that these papers were particularly good at influencing their readers .  Swings were highest amongst voters who watched both BBC and ITV news , and amongst those who avoided watching highbrow television news programmes , but the <head>differences</head> between these groups of television viewers were slight . Once we distinguished between party supporters and uncommitted voters we found no consistent differences between voters with different viewing habits .   Swings were highest amongst those who relied more on television than the press for help in deciding how to vote ,  rather lower amongst those who relied more on the press ,  and lowest of all amongst the 40 per cent of the electorate who found television and the press equally useful .

On issues like unilateralism or the economy ,  papers like the Guardian  and Telegraph  did seem to influence their readers as much as the tabloids ,  but not on the question of voting choice .  Persistent Guardian  readers swung strongly towards a more unilateralist position ,  while Telegraph  and Times  readers swung in the opposite direction .  The <head>differences</head> between Mirror and Sun/Star readers were in the expected directions but quite small . Similarly ,  on swings towards optimism about the state of the economy ,  the difference between Guardian  and Telegraph/Times  readers was greater than between Mirror  and Sun/Star  readers .

That may be true ,  but in 1987 hostile interviews with Neil Kinnock trying to explain his party 's  defence policy counted as part of the Labour Party 's  coverage .  Coverage of all  kinds can be both favourable and unfavourable  no matter whether politicians are in government or in opposition  and politicians themselves must bear the prime responsibility for ensuring that when they do get access to the media they present their own case well .  There is no <head>difference</head> between government coverage and party coverage in this respect except that government has more initiative in determining the news , which means that it has more opportunity than the opposition to ensure that its coverage is favourable . So long as balance is defined in terms of the quantity of party coverage  and not whether it is favourable or unfavourable  then the only justification for awarding the government extra coverage is that the government represents order ,  stability ,  and legitimate authority ,  which the media has a duty to support .  Those who do not approve the Mobilizing Ideal for the media should not approve extra media time for the government ,  especially near to election time .

Right - wing readers of a right - wing paper were more  likely than left - wing readers of that same paper to claim that their paper was biased towards the right  though a majority of both left -  and right - wing readers typically agreed that their papers were biased and agreed on the direction of that bias .  Instead of reacting against the bias in their chosen paper ,  readers tended  ( at the margin )  to defend their paper  ( if it was biased against their party )  or even to glory in its bias  ( if it was biased in favour of their party )  .  The <head>difference</head> between public responses to perceptions of bias in the press and on television was reflected in the complex relationship between voters ' allegations of bias and their ratings of the usefulness of the press and television news . Viewers who alleged bias on television tended to give television news lower  marks for usefulness than viewers who perceived no bias on television ;  but readers who alleged bias in their papers tended to give their papers higher  marks for usefulness than readers who perceived no bias in their paper  ( Chapter 6 )  .  Overall ,  although readers were well aware that their papers were relatively biased compared to television and although they rated television as much more useful for providing information about issues ,  they did not  rate television much more useful in helping them decide how to vote .

The switch of news focus clearly had some  influence on the public 's  agenda but a remarkably small one :  in terms of television influencing the public 's  agenda the cause seemed much greater than the effect .  ONCE IN FOUR YEARS :  THE FINDINGS A major theme that ran through our findings was the enormous <head>difference</head> between election and non - election times . In the midterm between elections interest in politics was much higher amongst highly educated voters and amongst regular readers of the quality press  the Guardian  ,  the Telegraph  ,  The Times  ,  and similar papers .  But that was no longer true at election time :  as the election approached the highly educated became less interested and the less well educated became more interested  ( Chapter 2 )  .

When the Constituent Assembly was dissolved after the 1917 Revolution ,  and the Bolsheviks '  Land Decree had stolen the main plank of the Socialist Revolutionaries '  platform ,  Siberian and Black - Earth peasants alike failed to give any further support to their still loyal party ,  despite the fact that for a period an SR - dominated Directory prevailed in eastern Russia .  The vote for the SRs had been strong in the Kursk and Poltava gubernii .  Further non - economic influences that cannot be ignored are ethnic and religious <head>differences</head> . These do not concern us for Kursk guberniia ,  which was almost exclusively Great Russian and Orthodox ,  but the traditional independence of the Old Believer elements in the Siberian peasantry must not be forgotten .  Kursk differed radically in this way from Poltava ,  which lay in the Ukraine .

A local priest was even so bold as to call the system a home - brew democracy .

Another <head>difference</head> between Nikol 'skaia and Roslavl ' was the obvious greater isolation of the former , although it was nearer to the guberniia capital . That did not mean much ,  since Kursk was itself a drowsy centre with almost no factories and only the main railway line from Moscow to enliven it .  As late as 1926 90.9 per cent of all inhabitants in the guberniia were in rural locations ,  one of the highest percentages for European Russia .
