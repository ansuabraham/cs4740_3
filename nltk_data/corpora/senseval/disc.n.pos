To do these effectively you need either an abdominal board which can be used on an incline ,  or a plank with one end raised on bricks and a piece of rope tied to that end to hook your feet underneath .  ( The angle of the incline board can be made steeper as strength and fitness increases .  )  For the sit - ups either a dumb - bell or a weight <head>disc</head> is held to the chest , and the back is kept slightly rounded with the chin on the chest . The start and finish positions are such that there is no rest until all the reps have been completed .  The sit - ups start with the back off the board ,  and end before the upper body  reaches the vertical position .

As a professional carver I thought it only natural to get my hands on one of those new Arbortech Woodcarvers to add to my compendium of tools last year .  I had no specific use at the time ,  but I thought it would prove a handy addition to the workshop ,  and was delighted when my grandfather elected to purchase the tool for me .  Sadly he died shortly afterwards and for many reasons it was some months before I used the <head>disc</head> . The advent of the Arbortech Carving Competition at the 1990 Woodworker Show gave me the idea of putting the tool to some good use .  My grandfather had always taken a keen interest in my work ,  and I had an equal admiration of the stories of his time spent in Burma during the Second World War .

Such is the waste removal power of this sort of tool ,  that safety for the operator and workpiece must be considered .  On a superficial level then ,  the SuperCut is the safer tool ,  slipping whenever problems arise ,  though there is concern about the chain breaking .  However , I found that in many instances this slipping action makes the <head>disc</head> useless , as it is unable to cut to any depth before it stops rotating . I had expected it to be best for trenching and shaping in the vertical position ,  but on all but the softest of timbers it failed to supply a substantial cut .  Conversely I discovered that it could cut with the disc flat ,  or at a slight angle ,  and I can see it having benefits for very fine work .

The silver cylinder and cone worked wonders ,  and I 'd be interested to try some of the other shapes .

There is also a drum sander , nylon brush and a steel mandrel for unmounted <head>discs</head> or defuzzing pads . All these bits are changed quite simply in the 44 with a spanner and locking pin ,  while the smaller 88 uses a C - spanner and fingers .  I found this a little fiddly ,  with the C - spanner light weight ,  but the sliding finger guard ,  which covers the collet on the 88 is excellent for ensuring digits do n't get near burrs .

The bench table is clamped securely in position by means of two tommy bar bolts .  For most applications ,  you can use a try square to set the table at 90 ,  but the table can be angled downwards and locked for sanding angles down to 45 .  The bench table is fitted with a very useful horizontal angleguide which can be locked into any position in front of the <head>disc</head> , or it can be locked at the desired angle while being free to slide in a slot parallel with the disc face . The Wolfcraft Bench Sander is ideal for truing up faces of timber prior to making joints ,  especially mitre - joints  ( ideal for frame makers !  )  In addition ,  you can use it for metal - grinding ,  for instance when sharpening cold chisels ,  rotary - mower blades and other cutting tool blades .

Alternatively ,  you can sometimes save money by using different firms for each process .  Look in the trade press to find them .  If you want a printed sleeve for your record , you need them before the <head>discs</head> are being made so that they can be delivered to the pressing plant and bagged up. Five hundred picture sleeves can cost from 200 to 500 depending on the number of colours and the thickness of the card .  It is worth trying to get a distribution company to take your record on .

Their responsibilities include ensuring availability of the master tape to suit the release schedule ;  overseeing the production of artwork for the sleeve 's  manufacture ;  preparing the appropriate campaign for the single or the album release ;  and keeping within the promotion budget which is prepared with the marketing director .   In addition ,  they decide the quantity of the initial pressing of their artists '  recordings  ( for a new artist 's  first single this would be around 5,000 )  ;  they liaise with the manufacturing plant to ensure further stock is available if it is needed ;  and they avoid producing stock which would probably never be sold .  The label manager also organizes promotional material like T - shirts , badges , picture <head>discs</head> and special limited edition sleeves ( in the right quantities to ensure maximum effect and minimum waste ) . Along with the press and promotion staff ,  the marketing department has to ensure that every potential record - buyer is aware of their artists '  work .  Assembling the right creative material ,  such as publicity photographs ,  sleeve designs ,  poster and advertisement material ,  is important for all artists .

The maximum speed restriction is surprising considering that ZR - rated 255/60x16 Avon Turbospeed tyres are already standard equipment ;  it is possible that the company wants to leave space for higher - performance versions still to come .

The steering and braking systems are power - assisted rack and pinion and all - round ventilated <head>discs</head> as before and overall dimensions , dictated by the saloon 's 120.5ins wheelbase , are again comparable at 210ins long and 80.5ins wide .

Based mostly on using a laser - <head>disc</head> player controlled by a Mac II , the system allows a user to explore as the developers like to say the painting and its history . Fronted by a HyperCard - like interface  SuperCard ,  actually  the system lets users click and move from point to point on the painting and get lectures and comments from old bores ,  ex - mistresses ,  people who were there ,  dopey ex - Nazi pilots ,  Picasso mavens and all sorts of experts .

Besides the Double Concerto and the two solo Concertos in E major and A minor the disc includes the delightful Concerto for Violin and Oboe reconstructed from the Double Keyboard Concerto in C minor ,  with the oboist Paul Goodwin joining Catherine Mackintosh .  It makes an ideal coupling for children of all ages to have three French masterpieces on a single disc - not just Saint - Saens '  Carnival of the Animals ,  but Bizet 's  Children 's  Games and Ravel 's  Mother Goose ,  all in fresh ,  well - sprung performances from the LSO under the ballet conductor ,  Barry Wordsworth .

This makes sense in Japan where  ( because of stellar house prices )  most young single professionals still live at home with their parents and have cash to spend ,  and where people do not make a habit of throwing bricks through car windows and stealing things .  Consequently ,  for lack of a better alternative ,  the car has become the favoured means of personal expression ,  or as an Autobacs Seven director ,  Kenzo Kido ,  puts it ,  the equivalent of life space .

The technology that has been substituted for human lives on the widest scale is that of the microprocessor .

It does the old job much better and some new jobs too .  Although microchips give machines only a smidgen of intelligence ,  that can go a long way when sensibly applied by human masters .

A tower may seem round from a distance ,  but there is no need to doubt our closer observation that it is square .  Sometimes ,  moreover ,  experience can show that our reasoning is superficial and incorrect ,  as when we learn from it that ,  despite what we might think ,  an arrow fired upwards from a moving ship will not fall behind but back on to it .  At other times , however , reason can correct the appearances of sense ; from the waxing and waning of the moon , according to how it is illuminated by the sun , we can deduce that it is a globe , and not the flat <head>disc</head> it appears to be . Furthermore ,  as when we infer from observed sweat the existence of pores in the skin ,  reason can lead us from what can be perceived to what cannot .  Gassendi 's  empiricist views on the derivation of our ideas from sense - experience ,  on natural philosophy and its foundation in carefully considered observation ,  and his stress on the explanatory value of Epicurean atomism ,  were already well known to Hobbes and others when they were formally introduced into England via the publication ,  in 1654 ,  of Walter Charleton 's  Physiologia Epicuro - gassendo - Charltonia :  a Fabrick of Science Natural upon the Hypothesis of Atoms ,  Founded by Epicurus ,  Repaired by Petrus Gassendus ,  Augmented by Walter Charleton  .

Considerable skill was required in the making of corduroy ,  working - class fabric or not.

Today , of course , the process is mechanized ; four hundred razor - sharp cutting <head>discs</head> slice more than a yard of cloth in one swift pass . One advantage of corduroy ,  aside from its warmth and comfort ,  is the richness it gives colours .

In the first example there is a white outer skin of pure silver ,  with overlapping joins at each end .  Between this and the core is an alloy of copper and silver  ( light grey in the photo )  .  This is a solder attaching two <head>discs</head> of silver foil cupped around the copper core like the foil wrappers around a chocolate penny . The second example has no joins in the outer skin ,  only a copper - silver alloy coating ,  indicating that it was plated with molten metal rather than foils .

X - ray diffraction  ( XRD )  analysis  ( see glossary )  is ideally suited to this sort of problem as it requires only a minute sample and ,  most important ,  it identifies the mineral or compound present .

Thus , where element analysis by X - ray fluorescence of the inlays on two silver Anglo - Saxon <head>disc</head> brooches shows both to have a major component of silver , with some copper and sulphur .

Jury ,  audience and critics  ( including me )  were overwhelmingly pro Vengerov ,  whether he was performing Bach ,  Beethoven or Paganini .

The orchestral one with the Israel Philharmonic and Zubin Mehta features what might be loosely called display pieces .  It needs a special artist to sustain such a programme ,  and the wonderful thing about Vengerov 's  playing is that in ,  say ,  the Paganini First Concerto ,  one can sit back and take the accomplishment for granted ,  acknowledge that he can overcome any Paganinian hurdle ,  and simply relish the way he actually makes something of the music .

Krauss 's  direction of the other Strauss 's  Die Fledermaus is another irreplaceable set ,  now coming up fresh - minted  ( 425 9902 )  ,  with Julius Patzak as the most beguiling of all Eisensteins and Wilma Lipp a delightfully coquettish Rosalinde .  A bonus on this <head>disc</head> is a New Year 's Concert of Strauss waltzes in which Krauss was a master . The same series features George Szell in vital and refined accounts of Brahms 's  Third Symphony and Dvorak 's  Eighth with the Concertgebouw  ( 425 9942 )  ,  readings to lift the heart .  Klemperer 's  live account of Mahler 's  Kindertotenlieder with the same orchestra may not be in such good sound ,  but with Kathleen Ferrier as soloist this is another important document ,  and it is coupled with an unrivalled version of Brahms 's  Liebeslieder - Walzer from the 1952 Edinburgh Festival .

Between them come Stravinsky 's  Dumbarton Oaks concerto and Frank Martin 's  Petite Symphonie Concertante ,  a work that grows in stature with every hearing ,  especially when conducted and played as well as it is here .  Yet none of these works can rival ,  for sheer novelty and strangeness ,  Sibelius 's  Sixth Symphony ,  still one of the most mystifying and mesmerising orchestral utterances of the century .

( Write to the British Audio Dealers Association for a list :  PO Box 229 ,  London N1 7UU .  )  The process does work on genuinely dirty records but , unfortunately , cannot provide the Lazarus touch for <head>discs</head> that have been played on decks that use a small chisel as a stylus . Inspect carefully before buying second - hand .  After many hours of listening solely to CD ,  I was also surprised at the sound quality of records played on decent equipment .

The actual system is generally placed in an enclosure ,  which provides a means both for keeping moisture in and for preventing volatile organic compounds from leaving without treatment .

Overall ,  there are several advantages to landfarming .  It provides a standard method for treating contaminated soils ,  sands ,  and solids ;  it provides treatment for surface contamination ,  while other methods are more suited to subsurface treatment ;  and it also requires a relatively low level of technology ,  meaning less can go wrong with the process .

During the l960s and 1970s ,  when there was much student and industrial militancy in Britain ,  the numbers of personal dossiers rose dramatically .  In recent years the entire MI5 registry has been transferred on to a computer at a Ministry of Defence office in Mount Row ,  Mayfair .  The original system used a 25 million ICL 2960 computer with 100 on - line EDS - 200 <head>disc</head> stores capable of holding 30 million separate dossiers but in 1984 ( an apt year indeed ) two ICL 2980 computers were ordered which provide enough capacity to store a 1,000 - word report on every adult in Britain . As it is hard to believe that even MI5 thinks there are that many  subversives ,  spies and traitors in the country ,  it must keep a lot of files on innocent people .  Here is a straightforward example of how the Maxwell Fyfe directive is ignored .

A wooden rod was placed through the centre hole of a whorl or <head>disc</head> made of wood or stone . Then the rod was twisted by the spinner ,  who pulled strands out from the fleece ,  allowing them to twist into thread by the action of the revolving spindle .  When a long length had been spun ,  it was wound onto the rod of the spindle ,  and the process was repeated .

The disc records invented by Berliner were the first to possess this advantage ,  since they could be stamped out almost like printing .  They also permitted a much simpler reproducing machine ,  since the groove itself propelled the soundbox ,  no additional screw mechanism being necessary  ( 7 )  .  At first , the playing time for both <head>discs</head> and cylinders was the same about two minutes but the fact that discs could be made in different sizes , all of which could be played on the same machine , was another advantage . In 1901 it was found that a ten - inch disc  ( playing for three minutes )  was better for most types of music ,  even popular songs ,  and the popular single was born .  Although cylinder manufacturers countered effectively for some decades ,  first with moulding techniques and later with finer grooves ,  the overwhelming simplicity of being able to press thousands of copies of disc records and play them on a simple machine eventually told in the disc 's  favour .

Any account of these milestones has to bear both applications in mind .  It did not take long for engineers to realise they could use more than one microphone ,  and balance the music internally .  Indeed , the Illustrated London News shows that Guest Merriman 's experiment had included several microphones and a selector system , but the surviving <head>disc</head> shows no sign of active mixing . Before long ,  engineers were performing sound - mixing functions hitherto the responsibility of the conductor or musical director .  One of the earliest collaborators was the conductor Leopold Stokowski ,  who happily agreed to experiments to divide the Philadelphia Orchestra into individually miked sections for increased clarity ,  presumably in search of something more like the clarity he perceived from the conductor 's  rostrum  ( 14 )  .

Experiments in Paris involving transmission by telephone lines date back to 1881 ,  but it needed the technology of the 1930s to record two channels with adequate fidelity ,  synchronization and separation .  Once again ,  Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra were in the forefront .  Two excerpts from Scriabin 's Poem of Fire were recorded on stereo <head>discs</head> on 12 March 1932 . These were followed on later dates by other experimental recordings .  As far as we know ,  they all used two or three microphones spaced some yards apart along the front of the orchestra ,  a technique favoured by American engineers to this day .

The 1930s were also a time for experimental long - playing records .  But what one means by the first LP depends very much on your definition of LP ;  long - playing records of various types date back to the 1900s ,  as we shall see later .  The stimulus in the 1930s was , again , the cinema ; for patent reasons , some studios preferred to distribute their films with separate <head>disc</head> soundtracks , rather than have the sound printed optically on the film itself . To match a 1000ft reel of film which ran for a little over eleven minutes ,  a 78rpm turntable had to be slowed to 33 1/3rpm  ( 18 )  .  This speed was then adopted for Victor 's  first long - playing records of 193134 .

But before tape came along ,  the record industry came up with one more development  full frequency - range recording .  The idea of a recording system covering the full range perceived by the human ear dates back to 1925 ,  when Brunswick claimed their electrical recordings covered the range from 16Hz to 21000Hz  ( 19 )  .  However , surviving <head>discs</head> show the upper limit was more like 4000Hz , inferior to Western Electric 's 4500Hz . By 1934 the highest frequency which  could reliably be recorded had reached 8000Hz .  In 1940 the British Decca Company was asked by RAF Coastal Command if it could record frequencies up to 14000Hz ,  almost the limit of human hearing .

It was a combination of inventions that proved to hold the secret to quality .

By 1982 ,  Sony 's  system ,  using its U - Matic videocassettes for storing 16 - bit digital audio  ( with a potential signal - to - noise ratio of some 96 decibels )  ,  had become an industry standard .  Meanwhile ,  Philips in Holland had been pioneering the use of Laservision videodiscs ,  the least unsuccessful of several types of disc for carrying video films .  These were played by a beam of laser light rather than a stylus , and Philips saw that combining digital audio with laser <head>disc</head> technology would be a great improvement upon the Dolby Cassette and the LP . The Compact Digital Disc  ( CD )  came on the market in 1982 ,  and has now practically replaced the LP as a distribution medium .  16 - bit audio has a signal - to - noise ratio which comfortably exceeds the full dynamic range of an orchestra ,  so it became possible to record orchestral music without any need to compress its dynamic range .

A search is now under way to find a medium with a reliably long shelf - life ,  because even if our present - day sound recordings last for a full century  ( which is doubtful )  ,  our successors will have to copy the whole collection every hundred years or so .

There was no impetus to develop anything more sophisticated than a spoken announcement or a separate piece of paper packed into the box .

It is debatable whether it was the cylinder or the <head>disc</head> that was the first to have a formal label physically attached . At the 1890 Convention of Local Phonograph Companies in Chicago ,  delegates asked for a longer cylinder with a section specifically set aside for an announcement ,  but this did not come about .

It is not so much the label which affects the collectability of early rock records ,  but the nature of this optional centre .  Until 1957 the Decca group in Great Britain made a  detachable  piece in the shape of a triangle  ( 35 )  .  These triangle centres tend to fetch high prices among collectors , because they are pretty safe guarantees that the <head>disc</head> in question was actually manufactured during the golden years of rock n roll , and is not a more modern pressing . There is a similar consideration for products of Britain 's  other principal manufacturer ,  the EMI group .  Its earliest singles had labels printed with gold ink ;  these ,  too ,  tend to have a higher value than later equivalents printed in silver .

However ,  since in this situation customers never knew what they were buying ,  the scheme did n't last very long .  Alas ,  the biggest deceptions in gramophone history comprised serious music ,  which was for many years cut down ,  both in duration and instrumentation .  The first symphony to be recorded was Schubert 's Unfinished published on one twelve - inch <head>disc</head> by American Columbia in 1911 . Fortuitously ,  its very title makes the short version acceptable under the Trades Descriptions Act !  But for the next decade or more ,  nearly all orchestral and instrumental music was issued in cut - down form ,  without any warning being given .

A sound archivist will want a recording which gets close to the sound of the original master - tape .  The rights to Presley 's  Sun recordings were acquired by RCA Victor together with the rights to the artist ,  and although it is now known that the tapes in RCA Victor 's  vault are not actually the 1955 originals ,  they are extremely good copies ,  and all have been reissued on compact disc .  Thus collectors can get back to the sound of the original master - tape far more closely than would be possible with any 1955 <head>disc</head> , let alone a forgery of one . There are very few artists whose genuine records attract prices which justify forgeries .  In 1987 the Black Album of pop singer Prince was withdrawn before it was issued ,  and only a few genuine copies escaped .

The Black Album ,  being a pure black sleeve  ( apart from lettering on the spine )  ,  was also particularly easy to reproduce .  There are three records which have defied the searches of record - collectors ,  and since no one alive today has examples to compare them with ,  they would seem to be prime candidates for potential forgers .  Two were scheduled for issue as Fonotipia 69000 and 69001 , single - sided <head>discs</head> nearly fourteen inches across . They comprised two operatic arias sung by the tenor Jean de Reszke ,  which are known to have been recorded in Paris on 22nd April 1905 .  It is assumed that de Reszke was dissatisfied with test - pressings ;  at any rate ,  neither was issued .

The above non - existent records are ,  as I say ,  obvious candidates for forgery ,  but the simple fact of their being made by obsolete technology makes it less likely that forgeries will appear .  There would have to be a high potential return to justify the trouble and expense .  Acetate <head>discs</head> were , for many years , the equivalent of wax cylinders before magnetic tape became universal . They were used by professionals and keen amateurs whenever a small number of tailor - made discs were required .  I consider the most likely candidate for forgery is therefore an unknown cylinder or an unknown acetate disc  in other words ,  a one - off ,  which would be difficult to compare with the genuine article ,  because there would be nothing with which to compare it .

Longer - Playing Recordings Three factors  ( size ,  speed ,  and groove - pitch )  might be manipulated to make long - playing records .  And because <head>discs</head> were on the market for a longer time , and attracted more investment , there are a correspondingly large number of freaks around . Probably the first long - playing disc records were made by the Neophone Company of London in 1904 ;  they were twenty inches in diameter .  The recordings comprised uninterrupted performances of opera overtures ,  but they cost ten shillings and sixpence each ,  and needed an outsize turntable .

The recordings comprised uninterrupted performances of opera overtures ,  but they cost ten shillings and sixpence each ,  and needed an outsize turntable .  So customers spent their money on twelve - inch discs instead ,  and in fact I have never seen a twenty - inch Neophone record .  The Marathon <head>discs</head> of 1912 ( 48 ) were made in the usual ten - inch and twelve - inch diameters , but with finer grooves . The idea was to record using hill - and - dale modulation ,  with the grooves packed closer together because there would be no risk of overlap .  In fact ,  the British inventor P. J. Packman took the idea a stage further ;  he developed a cutter for V - shaped grooves ,  rather than the U - shaped grooves then considered normal ,  so he got a deeper groove at the same time .

The new discs were also hill - and - dale ,  recorded with a relatively fine groove - pitch of 150 lines per inch ,  so a ten - inch side played rather longer than usual  ( about five minutes )  .  The grooves were U - bottomed with a radius of precisely 4.7 thousandths of an inch ,  and his reproducers were fitted with the very  first diamond styli ,  of exactly this size for minimum wear and surface - noise .  But the grooves were very shallow by normal <head>disc</head> standards , and to reduce the chances of the stylus being thrown out of the groove , the records were made absolutely flat , and a full quarter of an inch thick so they would be sure to stay that way . They turned out to be practically unbreakable as well as hard - wearing .  When I visited the Edison National Historic Site a few years ago ,  my guide told me that the full resources of his employer  ( the United States Government )  had failed to break one ;  but to find out exactly what was inside the quarter - inch slab ,  they had borrowed a diamond saw and cut one in half .

This proved to many people 's  satisfaction that Edison 's  re - creation was indistinguishable from the original .  Unfortunately ,  Edison was not himself a musician ,  and the technology he fathered was never used for mass - producing serious musical records .  Since 1910 he had been recording <head>discs</head> in London , and Raymond Wile 's list of Edison Disc Masters ( published in the Talking Machine Review from August 1971 onwards ) shows that many mouth - watering recordings of London opera - singers and other treasures were made .

Bigger cylinders allowed this to happen without extra wear .  But since all large commercially - made cylinders seem to have been copied from standard ones ,  there was no  increase in quality ,  only in volume .

In 1909 the Path company ,  which had by then abandoned cylinders ,  made their own twenty - inch monsters .  ( 50 )  .

They combined the two features of flexibility and long - playing time .  A relatively thin piece of cardboard  more like thick paper ,  really  was coated on one side with a material called Durium .  Because it was single - sided , the groove pitch was doubled to allow two numbers on each <head>disc</head> . The same company also made a French language course and many advertising mini - discs .

None of these unbreakable records succeeded in displacing shellac .  Actually ,  shellac was perhaps the least important constituent ;  the most important was slate dust ,  whose abrasive and gritty properties were needed for a rather unusual reason .  As we saw earlier , <head>discs</head> permitted simple and cheap record - players ; but the advantage was lost if the record - players had to have sapphire or diamond points made out of precious gems . So steel needles were often used instead .  To make the needle fit the groove ,  the disc contained abrasive material ,  so the tip would be ground down during the first two or three revolutions .
