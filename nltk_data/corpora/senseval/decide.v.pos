Despite the publicity giving the facts surrounding the transmission of the disease ,  ignorance was such that they became afraid of normal social contact .  It soon became clear that I could no longer rely on friends for help with everyday chores like shopping and housework when I needed it .  While <head>deciding</head> to stay as independent as possible , I contacted ACET who I knew provided practical care at home . I had previously spent about two years asking local social services and friends for help and not having it happen ,  so my flat had become pretty run down. There was also the question of my own exhaustion .

When such an article rises above the level of a gossip column ,  the artist 's  profile can be a valuable format .

After the Second World War , for example , the photographer Alexander Liberman <head>decided</head> to visit the studios of artists who had contributed to a century of painting in France , painters and sculptors closely connected with the School of Paris .

The critic necessarily has to take a manifesto into account .  Indeed ,  there is an implicit struggle between critic and artist ;  an artist 's  manifesto can be seen as a deliberate attempt to pre - empt critical comment and evaluation .  One puzzling decision for a critic to make is to <head>decide</head> whether to isolate any one artist as the leading figure of the group . When this is done ,  there is a tendency for other artists to be compared with the leader to their disadvantage .  It is a nice matter of judgement to decide how to treat the various personalities with justice .

If so ,  the power of critics may be no more than the listings services offered in the papers or on posters ,  while real power can be found in the organisation of the art market .  A different sort of exhibition which has had some success in attracting attention ,  and thus newspaper coverage ,  is the prize competition .  Here the critic is absolved from making judgements of his own by the need to report what a jury has <head>decided</head> about prizes . The critic 's  standing is thereby reduced ,  and the description or evaluation of the prize works is less than likely to be uninfluenced by their new position .  How then is the reader of art criticism best advised to use criticism to follow the fortunes of artists ?

Naipaul may in consequence be open to the charge of trying to diminish both the Michael X murders and the politics of the  Caribbean .  It can be said in his favour that the Michael X set seemed very like a fraud and a circus ,  and that these people had no deep connection with the politics of Trinidad .  In that last respect , however , they were like practically everyone else on the island , which may in itself be a reason why we should not be quick to <head>decide</head> that their behaviour lacked political significance , and consisted of antics .

Fraser observes that analysis is more limiting because it recreates the past only in the forms in which it was internalised or repressed .  ,  Not every reader of his book can have come to it believing the chauvinistic claims that have sometimes been issued on behalf both of psychoanalysis and of oral history ,  or prepared to believe that these pursuits could be successfully combined .  But it does not take long to <head>decide</head> that the experiment is being conducted with skill , and that the pursuits have at least a little in common . A piece of oral history may be meant to do without a presiding historian in much the same way in which an analytic session may be meant to do without a presiding analyst ;  theoretical presuppositions are subject in each case to a show of suspension ,  though it is clear that the theories of Freud and others will be present in the consulting - room ,  and that oral historians may be sympathetic to socialism and to the methods of  Marxist historiography .  Fraser 's  book is not without its evident presuppositions ,  and not every reader will feel that this autobiographer ,  having perused and digested his tape - recordings ,  talked to his analyst and completed his inner and outer voyages ,  knew something radically different about his past from what he had known before :  that something had been found ,  or proved .

No one would lightly believe that either of them has ever found it hard to tell the difference between himself and somebody else .  Dualistic explanations are moving ,  and intriguing :  but they are often thought ,  even by proponents ,  to be far - fetched ,  fictional ,  theoretical ,  counter - intuitive .  That Bellow , this participant in Roth 's inner life , can also be said to be out there in the world as his friend , and perhaps his rival , is a fact which does not help one to <head>decide</head> whether or not to trust the reports of literary duality what comes in has to have been out but it is very much in the tradition .

Over the summer I did read a few books and tentatively prepare a few classes ,  but it was indisputably a pretty lacklustre performance on my part .  I had managed to convince myself that ,  after a lifetime of teaching at university level ,  this was all going to be painfully easy .  I <head>decided</head> to keep up my flat in London and find fairly basic lodgings locally . The idea of leaving London for good  with its galleries ,  the opera and everything  was just too much for me .  I would go home for weekends ,  if I felt like it ,  and during the holidays .

In times past ,  I had tried to get across to the continent as much as possible ,  but now ,  while other people were going abroad for the first time because of all the cheap travel around ,  I was  ( without intending to be anti - social )  doing exactly the opposite and taking a look around the British Isles .  All this did ,  of course ,  cost money ,  but  if you 've had even a comparatively small amount of that and then lost it ,  you do tend to realize how transient the whole thing is and not worry so much about getting it back again .  Besides , I did n't think I could now save enough to make a significant difference to my standard of living when I retired , so I <head>decided</head> I might as well enjoy it while I had the chance . In retrospect ,  I would probably have saved a little bit more ,  but there it is  I did manage to save a little bit anyway .  I had been employed at Jersey House for about two and a half years when I was approached to see if I might like to do a little cleaning work to earn some overtime .

All my efforts were concentrated on keeping up appearances during those two hours of the day when I was with them .

Then ,  one day in May ,  Kathleen dropped a bombshell .  We had agreed at the start of this thing that pressing the Harwich local council for housing would probably be more trouble than it was worth :  if one of their inspectors had decided to check my circumstances with the port authorities ,  the customs people would inevitably have found out about the way in which I had been using their cupboard  ( and would have had a pink fit ,  probably )  .

If used strictly according to recommendations ,  chemical treatments have their place ,  if only as a last resort for serious threats .

It is generally agreed that only one wing - tip should be held while the glider is being moved about .  This is because if there is a person on both wing - tips ,  neither may have a good grip .  Furthermore , it is all too easy for both people to <head>decide</head> to let go at the same moment , so that no one is left holding a wing - tip . Traditionally ,  it was usual to take the upwind wing - tip and to hold it slightly below the horizontal .  This was because with the older gliders like the T21 or T31 ,  the wings were very high and they could not be held securely except by keeping one wing low .

With a trailer that you have not towed before ,  your first priority should be to explore its stability carefully .  You can do this by driving on a quiet ,  wide road with no traffic about ,  gradually increasing your speed and moving the steering slightly to produce a very slight weave .  As the speed is increased , the damping becomes less and you will be able to <head>decide</head> on a reasonable limit to keep to for the first half hour . By then you will have become tuned in to the driving and will be better able to judge if it is safe to go a little faster .  Remember to reduce speed on downhill stretches and to watch in the mirror for traffic which may be about to overtake ,  and which could therefore set up a swing .

Reducing the climbing angle slightly will help the driver to recognise the need for more speed .  However ,  levelling out too much will cause a large amount of slack in the cable and a further loss of speed ,  often leaving the aircraft in a dangerously nose - high attitude with no pull from the cable to maintain the speed .  With a slow launch the pilot must <head>decide</head> if the speed is sufficient to continue climbing . If it is ,  he should hold the present attitude and stand by to lower the  nose if the speed drops any further .  If the launch is much too slow ,  the nose must be lowered and the launch abandoned immediately .

You will discover large errors flying near north or south with even small amounts of bank ,  and large errors on east and west if you vary the speed .

The easy way to remember it is that for a lesser number of degrees ,  you turn left ,  e.g. turning from 350 to 320 is turning to a lesser number and therefore you turn left .

to look such truths in the eye is a test of courage .  It demands insight into the necessity of growing old ,  and the courage to renounce what is no longer compatible with it .  For only when one is able to discriminate between what must be discarded and what still remains as valuable for the future will one also be able to <head>decide</head> whether one is ready to strike out in the new direction consciously and positively . With benefit of the hindsight - ometer ,  it can be argued that my own movement into a structural limbo contained aspects of the unconscious journey towards a new self - knowledge ,  when the old values were able to be adjusted if not discarded ;  so that it was possible to break through the constraints imposed by the inculcated patterns of police culture ,  albeit in something of an unprogrammatic and fragmented manner .  Through the daily use of our special knowledge of the counter - culture ,  we were forced to acknowledge and come to grips with many of the complex social factors surrounding some drug use ,  which a legal framework could never adequately encompass .

Nathan Cohen himself was the eldest son of Lyon Cohen ,  one of the really influential men of early Canadian consolidation over five decades ,  not least among his own Jewish people .  His father ,  Lazarus Cohen  ( known as Reb Leizer )  ,  was formerly a bochur   ( teacher )  in the rabbinical college of Wolozhin ,  near Wilkovislak in Lithuania .  Born in 1844 to a family noted for its piety and scholarship , Lazarus had <head>decided</head> to emigrate to Canada in 1869 , having heard reports of the young country 's potential : its federation was then but two years old .

All of these observations of correlations between ERPs and different kinds of behaviour ,  including phenomenological reports ,  may tell us something about mental representations and the cognitive processes generating them ,  but they can tell us nothing about whether these representations and processes are conscious or unconscious .  It is the essential but usually overlooked fact that in any psychophysical experiment when ,  for example ,  subjects are asked whether or not they perceive a stimulus ,  their responses ,  verbal or otherwise ,  cannot be relied on as accurate accounts of their conscious experiences .  So , in a near - threshold task the subject may be accurately identifying the presence of a stimulus which tells the experimenter that there is some kind of mental representation of the stimulus , but there is no way the experimenter can <head>decide</head> whether or not the subject is consciously aware of the stimulus . Indeed ,  it is a common observation in experiments of this kind that subjects themselves often express confusion about what they are conscious of .  The problem arises whenever we try to use conscious awareness as a dependent variable :  for example ,  when we want to decide whether or not a particular external event leads to a phenomenal event .

Arbortech did so by developing a stamped disc with a tooth shape that differs from the chainsaw ,  to make sweeping cuts possible .  Its inventor Kevin Inkster started with a loose chain on a disc ,  and it is this formation that Toolbox have chosen .  This move has been promoted as a safety measure , permitting slip when the tool bites , but the legalities of patent law were doubtless considered when Toolbox <head>decided</head> to manufacture their version . Kevin Inkster discarded the loose chain when he was dissatisfied with the cut it gave ,  but it made him realise that he was certainly on the right lines .  To that extent the SuperCut is also on the right lines ,  and has some benefits ,  but for the serious woodcutter it is limiting .

To do so ,  both verbs and nouns need to be  qualified by adjectives and/or adverbs determined by the choreographers during the making of the design .

Before leaving Britain we 'd learnt that the hike up to Mount Kenya 's  walkers summit ,  Point Lenana ,  was not too demanding ,  and that the climbing route up to the twin summits of Batian and Nelion was graded mainly Diff ,  with a few patches of Severe ,  so we were n't expecting any technical problems .

At the crest of the dome is a large crater  ( more correctly called caldera )  ,  with its rim surmounted by a circle of large ,  steep - sided ,  flat - topped peaks .  The highest of these peaks , Wagagai ( 14,177ft/4321m ) , is in Ugandan territory and officially out of bounds , but our map showed the international boundary passing through the summit of the second highest peak ( just 20 metres lower than Wagagai ) , called Lower Elgon , so we <head>decided</head> to stay legal and aim for that instead .

The more feasible alternative is to dismember his plays between the history of his own day and the ideologies of ours .  Marxists invoke History as a transcendent signified ,  the ultimate in terms of which everything else is to be explained ;  but there are many histories ,  not one ,  and we choose those which suit us .  As Edward Pechter puts it , History does not tell us what the text is , because we <head>decide</head> what history is , and then put history into the text , rather than the other way round . Something similar is true of politics ,  another transcendent signified and argument - stopper .  Since politics is traditionally one of the major defining activities of a rational humanity ,  the discussion of literature in political terms is not only possible but desirable ,  as the major critics of the past have shown .

The line in Provenal is from Bertran de Born 's  Planh for the Young English King ,  which Pound had translated splendidly as early as 1909 .  The leopards and broom plants ,  Plantagenet emblems ,  signify the dynastic reasons for which Henry the young king was killed ,  as were Rizzio and Mary 's  husband Darnley centuries later .  Anyone is free to <head>decide</head> that life is too short for such unriddlings ; others ( I speak from experience ) may develop a taste for them . A more important point is that passages of this sort ,  spliced as they are with images like the lizard from the immediate foreground of Pound 's  tent inside the wire - mesh cage of the prison camp ,  do not come into being out of the free associations of idle reverie ,  though in these Pisan cantos Pound exploits the illusion of that ,  as Joyce did in Ulysses  when he pretended to transport himself and us into the mind of Leopold Bloom .  The reason we are reminded of these historical episodes ,  rather than any of a hundred others ,  comes clear only with the surprising and congested line that closes the quatrains about the Wars of the Roses :  But oblivion ,  not thy forgiveness ,  FRANCE .

Isn't that the giveaway ?  It will certainly seem so to the Englishman  ( as I take him to be )  ,  who found in the Envoi to Hugh Selwyn  Mauberley   Pound 's  most explicit farewell to England ,  as he prepared to leave her in 1918  externality :  an externality which ,  considering what Mauberley  attempts ,  is utterly disabling .  This is the same reader who , having decided that the Envoi is literary , in a limiting sense , is provoked by the word magic in the middle stanza into <head>deciding</head> that the term literary becomes a good deal more limiting , for the term aesthetic rises to our lips , and so , perhaps , does American ' And there we have it ! For this sort of Englishman ,  externality ,   to things English  is what any American is condemned to ;  and per contra inwardness  with things English  is what an Englishman quite simply has ,  painlessly ,  as a birthright .  From this point of view ,  the only good American is one who stays shamefacedly mute about his English cousins ,  however many years he may have lived among them .

However ,  Pound 's  diagnosis of Williams 's  condition was surely perceptive :  Williams could abide American reality  ( where Pound and Eliot had to flee from it )  because ,  as in the admirable To Elsie  (  The pure products of America / go crazy '  ,  he remained the immigrant ,  the outsider looking in on the behaviour of the nation that he had been ,  by the sheerest accident ,  born to .  Yvor Winters ,  eschewing lurid and unstable metaphors of bloodpoisoning and leukaemia ,  applied the discipline of intellectual history to isolate the virus that for him too disabled American literature of the north - east .  It was , he <head>decided</head> , Emersonianism a disease ( if that is what it is ) which is certainly no less rife now than it was when Winters made his diagnosis fifty years ago. This investigation was part of the wholesale scrutiny and revaluation that Winters was shocked into by the suicide of Hart Crane in 1932 .  In that revaluation ,  whereas Pound held his modest but respectable place ,  Williams was drastically denoted with Eliot rising in the scale against him.

The scale on which Pound was working was not clear even to the poet himself ;  so that the eleven cantos which he originally designated as preparation of the palette are now by responsible commentators considerably extended  to the extent that the first thirty cantos ,  which are all that the twenties knew of the poem  (  A Draft of XVI Cantos   ( Paris ,  June 1925 )  ;  A Draft often Cantos  1727   ( 100 copies ,  September 1928 )  ;  and A Draft of XXX Cantos   ( 210 copies ,  August 1930 )  )  ,  are now often regarded as laying out no the painter 's  palette the hues that only in subsequent cantos would be combined to polemical and imaginative purpose .  Certainly only in the next batch of cantos  ( post - 1930 )  ,  which began with extended excerpts from the founding fathers of the Republic ,  would the scale of magnitude of the poem become apparent ,  also its topicality and its Americanness .  Of the first thirty cantos by themselves , no account is more plausible than that of a writer in the New York Herald Tribune Books for 9 January 1927 , who <head>decided</head> : Mr Pound is avowedly writing a history of the Mediterranean basin ' The writer  was Ford Madox Ford ,  who was among the most loyal as he had been among the first of Pound 's  friends ;  in the twenties he was as penurious and as out of fashion as Pound .  It is easy to cheat when quoting from these early cantos :  either by imposing a seeming self - closure on passages that are in fact open at both ends ,  or  ( and as well )  by presenting a lyrically appealing passage as typical of the whole .

The critic necessarily has to take a manifesto into account .

One puzzling decision for a critic to make is to <head>decide</head> whether to isolate any one artist as the leading figure of the group . When this is done ,  there is a tendency for other artists to be compared with the leader to their disadvantage .

If so ,  the power of critics may be no more than the listings services offered in the papers or on posters ,  while real power can be found in the organisation of the art market .  A different sort of exhibition which has had some success in attracting attention ,  and thus newspaper coverage ,  is the prize competition .  Here the critic is absolved from making judgements of his own by the need to report what a jury has <head>decided</head> about prizes . The critic 's  standing is thereby reduced ,  and the description or evaluation of the prize works is less than likely to be uninfluenced by their new position .

Fraser observes that analysis is more limiting because it recreates the past only in the forms in which it was internalised or repressed .  ,  Not every reader of his book can have come to it believing the chauvinistic claims that have sometimes been issued on behalf both of psychoanalysis and of oral history ,  or prepared to believe that these pursuits could be successfully combined .  But it does not take long to <head>decide</head> that the experiment is being conducted with skill , and that the pursuits have at least a little in common . A piece of oral history may be meant to do without a presiding historian in much the same way in which an analytic session may be meant to do without a presiding analyst ;  theoretical presuppositions are subject in each case to a show of suspension ,  though it is clear that the theories of Freud and others will be present in the consulting - room ,  and that oral historians may be sympathetic to socialism and to the methods of  Marxist historiography .  Fraser 's  book is not without its evident presuppositions ,  and not every reader will feel that this autobiographer ,  having perused and digested his tape - recordings ,  talked to his analyst and completed his inner and outer voyages ,  knew something radically different about his past from what he had known before :  that something had been found ,  or proved .

Last Sunday the belated Lord Woodleigh and Miss Jilly Jonathan could not see the famous Blue Grotto on  this island because Lord Woodleigh insisted to go to Mass in a church here .  It was this ,  I am thinking ,  that made Miss Jonathan realize that if the marriage she was about to enter into with a man much different from herself ,  and older also ,  would not go well ,  she would never from a Catholic be obtaining a divorce .  So she <head>decided</head> to make away with him. But that 's  ridiculous ,  Arabella Buckley bounced out .  I mean ,  the girl was n't even married to him yet .

In times past ,  I had tried to get across to the continent as much as possible ,  but now ,  while other people were going abroad for the first time because of all the cheap travel around ,  I was  ( without intending to be anti - social )  doing exactly the opposite and taking a look around the British Isles .  All this did ,  of course ,  cost money ,  but  if you 've had even a comparatively small amount of that and then lost it ,  you do tend to realize how transient the whole thing is and not worry so much about getting it back again .  Besides , I did n't think I could now save enough to make a significant difference to my standard of living when I retired , so I <head>decided</head> I might as well enjoy it while I had the chance .

It is generally agreed that only one wing - tip should be held while the glider is being moved about .  This is because if there is a person on both wing - tips ,  neither may have a good grip .

Traditionally ,  it was usual to take the upwind wing - tip and to hold it slightly below the horizontal .

With a trailer that you have not towed before ,  your first priority should be to explore its stability carefully .  You can do this by driving on a quiet ,  wide road with no traffic about ,  gradually increasing your speed and moving the steering slightly to produce a very slight weave .  As the speed is increased , the damping becomes less and you will be able to <head>decide</head> on a reasonable limit to keep to for the first half hour . By then you will have become tuned in to the driving and will be better able to judge if it is safe to go a little faster .  Remember to reduce speed on downhill stretches and to watch in the mirror for traffic which may be about to overtake ,  and which could therefore set up a swing .

Reducing the climbing angle slightly will help the driver to recognise the need for more speed .  However ,  levelling out too much will cause a large amount of slack in the cable and a further loss of speed ,  often leaving the aircraft in a dangerously nose - high attitude with no pull from the cable to maintain the speed .  With a slow launch the pilot must <head>decide</head> if the speed is sufficient to continue climbing . If it is ,  he should hold the present attitude and stand by to lower the  nose if the speed drops any further .  If the launch is much too slow ,  the nose must be lowered and the launch abandoned immediately .

You will discover large errors flying near north or south with even small amounts of bank ,  and large errors on east and west if you vary the speed .

The easy way to remember it is that for a lesser number of degrees ,  you turn left ,  e.g. turning from 350 to 320 is turning to a lesser number and therefore you turn left .

to look such truths in the eye is a test of courage .  It demands insight into the necessity of growing old ,  and the courage to renounce what is no longer compatible with it .

With benefit of the hindsight - ometer ,  it can be argued that my own movement into a structural limbo contained aspects of the unconscious journey towards a new self - knowledge ,  when the old values were able to be adjusted if not discarded ;  so that it was possible to break through the constraints imposed by the inculcated patterns of police culture ,  albeit in something of an unprogrammatic and fragmented manner .  Through the daily use of our special knowledge of the counter - culture ,  we were forced to acknowledge and come to grips with many of the complex social factors surrounding some drug use ,  which a legal framework could never adequately encompass .

Nathan Cohen himself was the eldest son of Lyon Cohen ,  one of the really influential men of early Canadian consolidation over five decades ,  not least among his own Jewish people .  His father ,  Lazarus Cohen  ( known as Reb Leizer )  ,  was formerly a bochur   ( teacher )  in the rabbinical college of Wolozhin ,  near Wilkovislak in Lithuania .  Born in 1844 to a family noted for its piety and scholarship , Lazarus had <head>decided</head> to emigrate to Canada in 1869 , having heard reports of the young country 's potential : its federation was then but two years old .

All of these observations of correlations between ERPs and different kinds of behaviour ,  including phenomenological reports ,  may tell us something about mental representations and the cognitive processes generating them ,  but they can tell us nothing about whether these representations and processes are conscious or unconscious .  It is the essential but usually overlooked fact that in any psychophysical experiment when ,  for example ,  subjects are asked whether or not they perceive a stimulus ,  their responses ,  verbal or otherwise ,  cannot be relied on as accurate accounts of their conscious experiences .  So , in a near - threshold task the subject may be accurately identifying the presence of a stimulus which tells the experimenter that there is some kind of mental representation of the stimulus , but there is no way the experimenter can <head>decide</head> whether or not the subject is consciously aware of the stimulus . Indeed ,  it is a common observation in experiments of this kind that subjects themselves often express confusion about what they are conscious of .  The problem arises whenever we try to use conscious awareness as a dependent variable :  for example ,  when we want to decide whether or not a particular external event leads to a phenomenal event .

Arbortech did so by developing a stamped disc with a tooth shape that differs from the chainsaw ,  to make sweeping cuts possible .

Kevin Inkster discarded the loose chain when he was dissatisfied with the cut it gave ,  but it made him realise that he was certainly on the right lines .  To that extent the SuperCut is also on the right lines ,  and has some benefits ,  but for the serious woodcutter it is limiting .

As we walked through the hills we saw several large herds of long - horned cattle ,  guarded by warriors called morani  who were stern but not unfriendly ,  and brightly decorated ,  like our guide ,  with their faces painted and hair thick with ochre .

Like Mount Kenya ,  Elgon is the remains of an ancient volcano ,  and rises as a gigantic dome high above the surrounding plains .  At the crest of the dome is a large crater  ( more correctly called caldera )  ,  with its rim surmounted by a circle of large ,  steep - sided ,  flat - topped peaks .  The highest of these peaks , Wagagai ( 14,177ft/4321m ) , is in Ugandan territory and officially out of bounds , but our map showed the international boundary passing through the summit of the second highest peak ( just 20 metres lower than Wagagai ) , called Lower Elgon , so we <head>decided</head> to stay legal and aim for that instead . Part of Mount Elgon is a national park ,  a protected area for several species of animals ,  including elephant and buffalo .  Remembering the close encounter near Maralal ,  we arranged for an armed park ranger to accompany us ,  so that we would also be protected in case of emergency .

The more feasible alternative is to dismember his plays between the history of his own day and the ideologies of ours .  Marxists invoke History as a transcendent signified ,  the ultimate in terms of which everything else is to be explained ;  but there are many histories ,  not one ,  and we choose those which suit us .  As Edward Pechter puts it , History does not tell us what the text is , because we <head>decide</head> what history is , and then put history into the text , rather than the other way round . Something similar is true of politics ,  another transcendent signified and argument - stopper .  Since politics is traditionally one of the major defining activities of a rational humanity ,  the discussion of literature in political terms is not only possible but desirable ,  as the major critics of the past have shown .

The line in Provenal is from Bertran de Born 's  Planh for the Young English King ,  which Pound had translated splendidly as early as 1909 .  The leopards and broom plants ,  Plantagenet emblems ,  signify the dynastic reasons for which Henry the young king was killed ,  as were Rizzio and Mary 's  husband Darnley centuries later .  Anyone is free to <head>decide</head> that life is too short for such unriddlings ; others ( I speak from experience ) may develop a taste for them . A more important point is that passages of this sort ,  spliced as they are with images like the lizard from the immediate foreground of Pound 's  tent inside the wire - mesh cage of the prison camp ,  do not come into being out of the free associations of idle reverie ,  though in these Pisan cantos Pound exploits the illusion of that ,  as Joyce did in Ulysses  when he pretended to transport himself and us into the mind of Leopold Bloom .  The reason we are reminded of these historical episodes ,  rather than any of a hundred others ,  comes clear only with the surprising and congested line that closes the quatrains about the Wars of the Roses :  But oblivion ,  not thy forgiveness ,  FRANCE .

Isn't that the giveaway ?  It will certainly seem so to the Englishman  ( as I take him to be )  ,  who found in the Envoi to Hugh Selwyn  Mauberley   Pound 's  most explicit farewell to England ,  as he prepared to leave her in 1918  externality :  an externality which ,  considering what Mauberley  attempts ,  is utterly disabling .  This is the same reader who , having decided that the Envoi is literary , in a limiting sense , is provoked by the word magic in the middle stanza into <head>deciding</head> that the term literary becomes a good deal more limiting , for the term aesthetic rises to our lips , and so , perhaps , does American ' And there we have it ! For this sort of Englishman ,  externality ,   to things English  is what any American is condemned to ;  and per contra inwardness  with things English  is what an Englishman quite simply has ,  painlessly ,  as a birthright .  From this point of view ,  the only good American is one who stays shamefacedly mute about his English cousins ,  however many years he may have lived among them .

However ,  Pound 's  diagnosis of Williams 's  condition was surely perceptive :  Williams could abide American reality  ( where Pound and Eliot had to flee from it )  because ,  as in the admirable To Elsie  (  The pure products of America / go crazy '  ,  he remained the immigrant ,  the outsider looking in on the behaviour of the nation that he had been ,  by the sheerest accident ,  born to .  Yvor Winters ,  eschewing lurid and unstable metaphors of bloodpoisoning and leukaemia ,  applied the discipline of intellectual history to isolate the virus that for him too disabled American literature of the north - east .  It was , he <head>decided</head> , Emersonianism a disease ( if that is what it is ) which is certainly no less rife now than it was when Winters made his diagnosis fifty years ago. This investigation was part of the wholesale scrutiny and revaluation that Winters was shocked into by the suicide of Hart Crane in 1932 .  In that revaluation ,  whereas Pound held his modest but respectable place ,  Williams was drastically denoted with Eliot rising in the scale against him.

The scale on which Pound was working was not clear even to the poet himself ;  so that the eleven cantos which he originally designated as preparation of the palette are now by responsible commentators considerably extended  to the extent that the first thirty cantos ,  which are all that the twenties knew of the poem  (  A Draft of XVI Cantos   ( Paris ,  June 1925 )  ;  A Draft often Cantos  1727   ( 100 copies ,  September 1928 )  ;  and A Draft of XXX Cantos   ( 210 copies ,  August 1930 )  )  ,  are now often regarded as laying out no the painter 's  palette the hues that only in subsequent cantos would be combined to polemical and imaginative purpose .  Certainly only in the next batch of cantos  ( post - 1930 )  ,  which began with extended excerpts from the founding fathers of the Republic ,  would the scale of magnitude of the poem become apparent ,  also its topicality and its Americanness .  Of the first thirty cantos by themselves , no account is more plausible than that of a writer in the New York Herald Tribune Books for 9 January 1927 , who <head>decided</head> : Mr Pound is avowedly writing a history of the Mediterranean basin ' The writer  was Ford Madox Ford ,  who was among the most loyal as he had been among the first of Pound 's  friends ;  in the twenties he was as penurious and as out of fashion as Pound .  It is easy to cheat when quoting from these early cantos :  either by imposing a seeming self - closure on passages that are in fact open at both ends ,  or  ( and as well )  by presenting a lyrically appealing passage as typical of the whole .
