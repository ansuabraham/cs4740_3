AI is concerned that the Tunisian Government ,  by its failure to investigate allegations of torture brought to its notice ,  appears to be condoning the use of torture .

Fry was a connoisseur of Renaissance art ,  but also he defended Post - Impressionism  ( a term he invented )  ,  was a painter ,  and published a monograph on Czanne .  In 1933 he wrote as follows in a lecture at Cambridge University :  An enormous amount of work has been done and perhaps still more <head>remains</head> to be done in arranging works of art in exact sequence of time . It is here that the Germans have done so much pioneer work ,  and indeed the whole tendency of their art historical studies has been to regard works of art almost entirely from a chronological point of view ,  as coefficients of a time sequence ,  without reference to their aesthetic significance .  The title of the lecture in which these words appeared was Art - history as  an Academic Study ,  but those were early days for the subject in the British Isles ;  only in London was there undergraduate teaching ,  at the Courtauld Institute which opened in 1933 .

Moreover ,  His role shifted easily from the alienated critic writing art columns for intellectual magazines to an impresario in the New York art - world judged by his commitment to a specific type of art and respected for its ultimate  ( commercial and influential )  success .  Greenberg 's  articles are marked by a confident authority ,  as in the following passage .  Looser paint - handling , combined with what <head>remained</head> an essentially Cubist sense of design , drawing , layout , was what artists as different as Gorky and Pollock had in common during the mid - 1940s . If the term Abstract Expressionist means anything verifiable ,  it means painterliness :  loose ,  rapid handling ,  or the look of it ;  masses that blot and fuse instead of shapes that stay distinct ;  large ,  conspicuous rhythms ;  broken  color  ;  uneven saturations or densities of paint ;  exhibited brush ,  knife ,  finger or rag marks  in short a constellation of physical features like those defined by Wlflinn when he extracted his notion of the Malerische  from Baroque art .  As we can now see ,  the displacing of the linear and quasi - geometrical as the dominant mode in New York  ( and Parisian )  abstract art after 1943 offers another instance of that cyclical alternation of non - painterly ,  or linear ,  and painterly which has marked the evolution of Western art since the sixteenth century .

He wrote :  Paolo Uccello would have been the most delightful and imaginative genius since Giotto that had adorned the art of painting ,  if he had devoted as much pains to figures and animals as he did to questions of perspective ,  for ,  although these are ingenious and good in their way ,  yet an immoderate devotion to them causes an infinite waste of  time ,  fatigues nature ,  clogs the mind with difficulties ,  and frequently renders it sterile where it had previously been fertile and facile .  But when Uccello died in his eighties , He left a daughter who could design , and a wife who used to say that Paolo would <head>remain</head> the night long in his study to work out the lines of his perspective , and that when she called him to come to rest , he replied , Oh what a sweet thing this perspective is ! Mathematical perspective of a Renaissance sort had not been used in European medieval art ,  where the size of a figure often derives from the person 's  importance ,  God the father never being small .  A perspective may be used which reverses the convergence of lines in the distance ;  instead ,  lines of perspective converge in front of the viewer ,  an unexpected phenomenon for a twentieth - century spectator used to photographs .

The dual division of ecclesiastical power has also been important because the religious orders have often been the vehicle for innovative theologies differing from the Roman line .  Because such religious orders are themselves controlled from Rome ,  Roman discipline is conveyed via a route other than by the bishops .  Even so , some orders still <head>remain</head> slightly independent from Rome , particularly the religious orders of solemn vows , whose existence preceded the reformation . Their numbers include the Augustinians and Dominicans ,  both of whom have been influential in Ireland and have produced theologians of liberal or left persuasion .

Nevertheless the predominant catholic power lies with the hierarchy and secular clergy .  Thus ,  while it is possible to identify liberal catholicism in Ireland from the late nineteenth century to the present ,  and though there has grown up a climate of liberal dissent and criticism of conservative catholicism ,  it is still possible to assert the prominence of conservative catholicism ,  particularly in its alliance with nationalism .  The predominant political religious form was and <head>remains</head> , with some modifications and with increasing opposition , a centralizing and conservative catholicism . The protestant churches in Ireland also retained their island - wide organization after the political partition of the island .

We reiterate :  the dominant beliefs of the alliances which we have termed historical blocs are not necessarily shared by all but are promoted successfully by dominant groups and have some grounding in the consciousness of the wider membership .  Thus ,  Irish nationalism is conceived by most members in an abstract way ,  but it has concrete import for key groups .  Equally , a particular type of catholic identity may not belong to all but <head>remains</head> politically dominant for similar reasons . The outcome of the dominance of both is that historically there have been critical mediations between religion and politics for catholic nationalists .  As will be seen in the remaining chapters ,  a particular form of Irish catholicism known as monopoly catholicism has assisted in the concrete success of the mix of the beliefs with economic beliefs in capitalism ,  ownership of land ,  and inheritance ,  helping to bring the elements to an explicit formulation in the 1937 Irish constitution ,  which has ever since shown considerable resistance to reformulation .

It is adhered to by increasing numbers who have become disillusioned with British identity and have seen Paisley 's  words about the traitorous nature of British governments become reality as protestant  loyalist domination in Ulster has been continuously eroded .

The republicanism of Irish socialist nationalists was of course logical in so far as they interpreted imperialism as an enemy of the indigenous population and as an expropriator of the people .  But it was thereby alien to Ulster protestant socialists .  A duality of class interests within republicanism has <head>remained</head> , with forms of bourgeois and rural peasant - owner republicanism existing side by side with socialist republicanism . This combination still exists in the provisional movement especially in the South despite the officially socialist policies of Sinn Fein ,  as well as in the Fianna Fil party .

As Gibbon has noted ,  the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles  ( 1975 :  3 )  .  The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic  nationalist and protestant  loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material interests of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions .

There did exist the small Northern Ireland Labour Party which disappeared after the fall of Stormont ;  but it had been based on industrial workers ,  particularly in the shipyards ,  and remained much smaller in size than its Southern counterpart .  As Gibbon has noted , the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism <head>remain</head> the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles ( 1975 : 3 ) . The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic  nationalist and protestant  loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material interests of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions .  By providing core beliefs ,  and by reinforcing their separateness for both alliances ,  religious beliefs and institutions equally suppress class divisions ,  become embroiled in cementing alliances ,  and help retain the overall divisional structure of Ireland as a whole .

This is one of the special characteristics of catholicism ,  and is found to a much lesser extent in non - episcopal traditions .  Failure to conform to directives of priests and bishops were seen to break the very fabric of communion and to allow sin to enter in .  This <head>remains</head> particularly so today where an objectivist stance on morality prevails in a national or local culture anywhere in the catholic world . From within this perspective bishops and clergy lay down rules for the laity to follow in any given situation and the teaching of the church is seen as absolutely clear and devoid of problematic .  Rules are enforced rather than principles declared .

1968 )  .  The idea of defending a  protestant heritage is not solely an Ulster phenomenon but rooted in the British tradition .  Whereas in Britain , with the growth of suffrage , catholics could never be perceived as a political threat because of the smallness of their numbers , in Ireland , with the growth of the home rule movement and its accompanying nationalism , they could only be perceived as politically , religiously , and nationally subversive and suspicion of them <head>remained</head> . The issues of freedom of conscience and freedom from Roman hegemony lie at the centre of Northern Ireland fundamentalism and are meshed in with its evangelical tenets .

In the Roman catholic account ,  Christ appoints Peter to lead the church he has founded .  In the other ,  the church is founded but taken over early on by the Popes in Rome and by priests who use magic and ritual to gain control of God 's   people ,  thus profaning his divine word .  For the one version , the Reformation is the catastrophe by which half Christendom defects from the church , the church itself <head>remaining</head> intact and faithful to Peter . This version still predominates among Roman catholic laity in most countries .  For the popular protestant version ,  one which is still shared probably by a majority of clergymen within the protestant denominations of the North ,  the church re - emerges after centuries of misguidance only with the Reformation .

For the popular protestant version ,  one which is still shared probably by a majority of clergymen within the protestant denominations of the North ,  the church re - emerges after centuries of misguidance only with the Reformation .  The protestant version has variants as to how pure this church is or whether it <head>remains</head> sinful , but the evangelical version which is the basic one in the North of Ireland opts absolutely for Jesus Saves ; the community , no longer medium of salvation , tends to take on a visible , earthly role , an occasion of grace and a support for religious this - worldly activity . Rome is seen to continue on its headlong path to misery and sin ,  a symbol of the rejection of Christ for the sake of human idols .  However ,  the earthly role of the community ,  be it protestant or catholic ,  is not seen as secondary to the religious message ,  but as either in continuity with or against it .

At this level ,  the power of the Roman catholic church bore directly on the institutions of government .

Even if Dil members had thought otherwise ,  it must by now be clear that the ethos of the Irish Republic was still one in which it was impolitic to be in conflict with the church .

The change in the socio - moral context was hardly recognized ,  and the corresponding change in religious social ethics had remained unformulated .  In the case of the Mother and Child scheme ,  it was rather through withdrawal from the scene that first the politicians and later the churchmen avoided further trouble .  As will be elaborated now in further contexts , it appears that the underlying reality to such difficulties was , and <head>remains</head> a complex contradiction which the catholic nationalist alliance has still failed to solve . On the one hand there were the beliefs in the nature and extent of the clergy 's  political religious power and how that power was to be exercised in the state .  There was also the general assumption that the fact of a state populated by catholics must perforce imply a heightened degree of institutionalized catholic  value in law.

It should be added here that the high clergy hardly recognized that they had actually been exercising a political religious power of a specifically sectarian or monopolistic type .  Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate ,  they meant they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state .  But they did and still do <head>remain</head> the authoritative conscience of the nation . In addition ,  the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships ,  doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues .  Part of the overall argument of this book is that ,  as the Roman catholic church is principal validator or legitimator of the Southern state along with the concept of the national entity ,  what that state goes on to do in the field of social ethics cannot be separated out from the responsibilities of the church .

As already stated ,  the clergy had sustained the catholic  nationalist populace over centuries of oppression .  Furthermore ,  the ranks of that clergy were drawn from the common people themselves .  But a key element <head>remained</head> the considerable filial loyalty the catholic nationalists showed towards their clergy , bishops , and Popes . The  authority of the clergy had been second to none during the years of persecution and this appears to have strengthened as a direct result of Roman centralization from the 1850s onwards .  This respect for authority has appeared throughout the examples given ,  but it has also been shown to be a respect within certain limits .

From 1899 ,  the intention of the clergy to assume and maintain absolute control of their schools led a number of them to refuse to appoint members of the Irish National Teachers '  Organization so as to avoid trade union interference .  The result was that the union became subordinated for some time to the hierarchy and a breakaway union of protestant teachers was formed .  Despite the curtailment of some of the clergy 's powers , friction between the teachers ' associations , particularly the INTO , and the Roman catholic clergy has <head>remained</head> until this day . Clergy control of the schools had indeed become a priority for the church leadership .  The understanding reached between them and the catholic  nationalist lay leadership resulted in schooling in the future state being allocated to the domain of the church ,  in exchange for the legitimation of that state by the church leadership .

The present interrelationship between control of the schools and the two alliances varies in each part of Ireland ,  though one should also bear in mind the additional underpinning of the alliances both North and South by one of the traditional values of bourgeois capitalism ,  private and selective schooling .  Throughout Ireland as a whole ,  there has generally been an anti - comprehensive ethos in the education system supportive of both class and sectarian divisions in schooling and which is now eroding only in part .  In Northern Ireland , the catholic schools ' sector is provided for out of state funds , and <head>remains</head> under the governorship of the local clergy , now assisted by laity and members of the local educational and library boards . Many Roman catholic schools up to 1968 were financed for capital expenditure by the local church as part of the church 's  determination not to lose control of them .  The chairman of the board is usually the parish priest or his curate .

All Children Together ,  or ACT ,  was formed in the early 1970s .  It draws its membership from across the spectrum of religious and non - religious groupings ,  though they are generally middle - class and mostly committed Christians .  They <head>remain</head> dedicated to the task of setting up a group of integrated schools as a sector of education complementary to the existing system . An appeal made to Rome in 1977 by the Roman catholic parents concerned with the Confirmation ban appeared to have been answered in their favour ,  as Bishop Philbin changed his pastoral policy and these children were allowed to go forward for confirmation in 19789 .  A notable achievement of ACT has been the passing of the Education  ( Northern Ireland )  Act of 1978 ,  permitting the establishment of multi - denominational schools where such is desired by adequate numbers of parents .

A similar treatment was recently meted out by Allied 's Tetley Walker subsidiary to what <head>remains</head> a fundamentally Georgian pub in an urban setting near Manchester the Church Inn at Lowton . Having applied cement render over the external brickwork ,  attached a hideous modern porch and added an extension in jarring and inappropriate modern materials ,  the brewery designers have gutted the interior .

Although biological methods of pest control such as Bacillus thuringiensis   ( for caterpillars )  are now available to committed organic gardeners ,  there are few of us who never  need to resort to the use of chemicals .  Pesticides are either selective  ( affecting specific insects only )  or non - selective .  Some kill on contact and are then rendered ineffective , whereas systemic ( translocated ) chemicals are absorbed into the plant 's system and <head>remain</head> active for much longer , which could delay the harvest of fruit and vegetables . Many gardeners prefer to apply systemic chemicals to ornamentals ,  restricting edible plants to spot treatment with contract pesticides .  Check that the chemical will in fact control the pest and can be used on the affected plant .

Its status or  ( as importantly )  its lack of value creates complex systems of meaning which are rarely articulated ;  for the police world has similar strictures to that which Benedict  ( 1967 )  described in her attempts to understand the rigidities of Japanese culture :  men who have accepted a system of values by which to live ,  cannot without courting in - efficiency and chaos keep for long a fenced - off portion of their lives where they think and behave according to a contrary set of values .  Anthropological modes of enquiry are therefore programmed to steer us through the assumptions of police society , so that contradictions no longer <head>remain</head> incomprehensible . The cultural baggage which any social group ,  tribe ,  or institution such as the police acquires over time can thus be translated to reveal just what sustains it ,  and furthermore reveal what the society itself may not even have understood .  Where there does exist a genuine public expression of concern about the way the police operate this cannot just be dismissed as a matter of misunderstanding or be written off as the foolish ramblings of that police folk devil the loony left ,  who would dismantle the system for their own political ends .

Its frenzied rejection was very different to that of the many projects listed in the Police Foundation or Home Office Registers of Research mentioned above ,  most of which are simply ignored and never ever receive any review .  I believe the denial of the PSI report and the furore it caused occurred precisely because it managed to get beneath the surface of police culture to explore the deep structures of belief and to comment adversely about their influence on police activities .  The invisibility in the written record , which Shapland and Hobbs ( 1989 ) observed , and the unrecorded information which Chatterton told the conference <head>remained</head> hidden in the heads of the constables are the result of cultural values , which are then brought to bear to deny validity to these agendas . It is worth noting the language in the Federation rebuttal of the PSI report ,  for it illustrates how the culture is programmed to sneer at the graphic literary phrase and dismiss the use of anecdotal material as unscientific :  while participant observation is considered to be a world away from research based on safe  academic principles  ( my emphasis )  .  Police culture is omnipotent is structuring such views of critical research .

This total reverence to the group binds ideas of silence ,  loyalty ,  and reticence together to create a positive category for belief and action and ,  in turn ,  links silence to other concepts of respect for the order of the institution .  In consequence ,  even the publication of an academic seminar paper carried out without formal approval could form a breach in the regulated structures of police existence and be subject to disciplinary control .  In such a world , the easy resolution of the ethical dilemma <head>remains</head> problematic , for as Anne Akeroyd ( 1984 : 134 ) recognizes there is not , nor ever likely to be any definitive agreement about the nature of either the problems or solutions facing the social scientist and the question of ethics . I have never completely resolved my own dilemma ,  for I do not think it has a simple resolution .  Unlike the natural sciences ,  which deal largely in results ,  the social sciences are rightly concerned for practice ,  perhaps because results are rarely possible in an exact mathematical sense .

Obviously concerned that his analysis of the negative influence of discipline on the efficiency of systems of communication might offend or incite displeasure ,  he avoided confrontation ;  but he need not have worried .  For it received the neglect that a great deal of insider research achieves and was channelled  ( unopened )  to me ,  accompanied by a two - line memo from a senior officer which suggested ,  I understand you are doing some research ;  you may find this useful .  In the following three years the thesis <head>remained</head> on my desk , unrequested by anyone else . Any suggestions for improvements in communications or any critical findings it may have contained were negated by institutional neglect and the silence which Arendt  ( 1958 )  argues is a primary tool of authority operated to effect !  The police ,  of course ,  can never really be geared easily to incorporate structural challenge to their existing concepts of order and control ,  for they are set up to maintain the symbols and practice which has sustained the status quo .

Research in the police ,  Irving further asserts ,  is a matter of pragmatics ,  eliminating philosophical enquiry into systems of belief ,  or how the knowledge of an ideology is transformed into action .  In the end ,  only the action is viable ,  so that all these essays tend to match the inside ethnography and are nullified by neglect or have any contentious matter treated as privileged information ,  for as Templeton  ( 1980 :  904 )  argues the police fear that if you have a better understanding of society ,  you are in a better position to change it  the very exercise they are reluctant to engage in .  Those who do go public are disloyal and there are thinly veiled attempts to dismiss the value of any revelation they make , for they are expected to <head>remain</head> silent and uncritical . When Ronald Gregory ,  the ex - chief constable of West Yorkshire ,  said little or nothing new about the Yorkshire Ripper case in a series of newspaper articles ,  he was castigated in Police Review   ( 1 July 1983 )  and they republished a 1979 photograph of him when his loyalty was unquestioned .  John Alderson ,  the ex - chief constable of Devon and Cornwall has suffered even more from his subsequent public persona ,  because of a move into academia ,  some critical publications ,  and a flirtation with the political life .

Since this condemnation of research opportunity ,  few studies have penetrated deeply beneath the sensitive skin of police culture ,  and even though Chatterton in his notes to my thesis argued there has been a considerable amount of participant police research ,  I would question whether many of these inquiries achieved the finer grain and detail ' of the insider 's  account ,  for they can never really know or tell if they have been excluded from the inner workings of police practice or prevented from gaining access to the hidden realities contained inside the heads of the constables .  Because of the litism which such an organization of control wields ,  it is not surprising there is difficulty in incorporating the outside researcher ,  or in accepting his critical findings .  And certainly that other main arm of executive control the army seems little better at this than the police , for the number of participant accounts of their deep structures <head>remains</head> negligible , supporting McCabe 's ( 1980 ) contention that we should be asking of all of these costly institutions , who is to be controlled by whom and for what reasons ? Meanwhile ,  as Reiner  ( 1985 )  suggests ,  the politicization of the police has proceeded at a pace ,  and can be illustrated by their growing willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy .  This trend is further displayed in their growing tendency to agree to be used as a pseudo - military arm of government in its socio - economic and industrial/political disputes with whole sections of society .

WPC Dick 's  salutary essay  ( 1985 )  changed little and generated few ripples on the ACPO pond ,  while one of the most powerfully critical books on policing in recent years  ( Jones 1980 )  seems to have had little effect on the structures of the organization ,  except ,  perhaps ,  to help draw its author  then a chief inspector  into the ACPO ranks .  Mervyn Jones  ( ibid .  )  ,  in this book on organizational  behaviors  ,  presented some glaringly uncomfortable findings .  Critical of the way that status is attributed by the institution , his thesis was that even as the service proclaims beat patrol work to be the basis of all good policework , it penalizes and stigmatizes those who <head>remain</head> there . The young officer ,  he concluded ,  must escape at the first opportunity or risk being classified as an unambitious no hoper at an early career stage .  A keenly stated desire to move into some area of specialization is a necessity ,  and ,  as a result ,  uniform patrol work becomes synonymous with failure and punishment .

Men get sent back  from specialist posts to uniform duties as a punishment and the strength of this metaphorical move downwards or backwards  ( you can never move up or forwards into uniform )  is not lost on young officers .

Jones 's book <head>remained</head> untouched on the shelves of Northumbria 's modest library in its first two years , even though it had good reviews ; and the influence of his research has been all but negligible . For even though some attempt to give status to the community or home beat officer has been made following Lord Scarman 's   ( 1981 )  report on the Brixton riots which gave something of a slap on the wrist to the service ,  the deference accorded to specialist posting or to detective work remains untouched .

Any need to analyse the ways in which the multi - variant police world forms a coherent and self - sustaining whole is material for the social scientist and not the practitioners ,  for they already live the system as a matter of course .  The police ,  therefore ,  have little to gain in promoting any exploration of their modes of thought ,  for analysis can only hold the possibility that the whole intricate system ,  to paraphrase Lvi - Strauss  ( 1967 )  ,  will be revealed as an immense disorder which is organised in the form of a grammar .  In consequence , police ethnography <head>remains</head> largely unwritten simply because it is unlikely the organization will be keen to reveal the ways this immense disorder is constructed , for it is not in their nature to allow other individuals to create their classifications for them . Indeed ,  institutional ideology sets out to strait - jacket minds and bodies and overcome individual thought  ( Foucault 1970 )  .

Favret - Saada 's  unique analysis  ( ibid .  128 )  of the bizarre subjective position she found herself in is a masterful assessment of the difficulties which arise when the ethnographer seeks to gain  knowledge of a social group which depends for its existence on misknowledge or silence :  For anyone who wants to understand the meaning of such a discourse ,  there is no other solution but to practise it oneself ,  to become one 's  own informant and to try and make explicit what one finds unstatable in oneself .  for it is difficult to see how the native could have any interest in the project of unveiling what can go on existing only if it <head>remains</head> veiled . ( ibid .  22 )  In succumbing to the temptation of subjectivism  ( ibid .  23 )  ,  she recognizes that it becomes impossible to put any distance between oneself and the native ,  or more importantly between oneself and oneself in such a situation .

Like other symbolic non - verbal devices ,  the multi - vocal nuances of our uniform were used in a variety of other ways as boundary markers to maintain our cultural identity and define our institutional specificities .  Just as the white - coated doctors in hospitals symbolize the clean and purifying nature of the healer ,  so the dark uniform of the police symbolizes not just the force identity ,  but also the presence of the avenger ,  who purifies through retribution rather than by cure .  It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force police service which <head>remains</head> unresolved , on which I will say more later in relation to the role of women police officers . The dark uniform we wore had a military cap with polished brim ,  and in our fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boots we presented an avenging image ,  clothed in the symbolic colour of death and darkness .  Black is a light absorbent ,  non - reflective colour and most suitable for controllers who operate with a degree of social anonymity ,  upholding the rule of law and the abstractions of the legal system .

In such inversions of social regard we can again see how movement will tend to confound the police preference for and reliance on a rigidly maintained classificatory world .  The changing values attributed to our own private delicts such as divorce ,  slander ,  adultery ,  debt ,  libel ,  blasphemy ,  obedience to church ,  and the like ,  have turned some earlier crimes into matters now governed by other social mores .  With the public appropriation of certain categories of property , however , the police have been on more certain ground , for the status attributed to the capture of the thief has <head>remained</head> fairly constant , at least since the police were created as a public body . The detective therefore has a legitimate target in the thief  ( again the metaphor is based in militarism )  ;  and this is currently reinforced by the politics of materialism .  The statistical expansion of recorded crimes and a success largely determined by detection rates support the inevitable institutional contention that more control is a necessity ,  and has been a corner - stone in police ideology for the whole of my service .

In effect this was a time when new worlds and new social structures were being forged ;  and in many ways we were closer to the world of the underground than that of the moral majority ,  for we were walking the same ground and like many in the alternative society were  ( somewhat unsystematically )  following an essential and perennial theme of history  that of man 's  journey as hero .  In this search for a new spiritual awareness ,  they  like us  were finding new possibilities to achieve a revived sense of what it is to be truly human in the transformational experience .  This is basically the same anthropological journey pursued by Lvi - Strauss ( 1973 ) in Tristes Tropiques , which <head>remains</head> a suitable precursor for most of the current reflexive ethnography . In this account ,  Lvi - Strauss uses the hero 's  journey to self - analysis in the field as a means of achieving or engendering knowledge  ( see also Caplan 1988 )  ;  emphasizing that it is the journey to self - awareness itself ,  and not the arrival ,  which is the most important aspect of the rite de passage  .  The forces produced in the individual on such occasions ,  in what Jung  ( 1964 )  calls a journey to individuation ,  manifest themselves in a number of very persuasive ways and in this case led to some radical reassessments of the existing moral ,  philosophic ,  political ,  and aesthetic order .

When deciding how wide to make your stance ,  look at yourself in a full length mirror to see what kind of a target you present for the opponent .

I know of some competitors who fight from a fully sideways - facing straddle stance .

Nevertheless it <head>remains</head> an excellent opening strike because , even more than the snap punch , it cocks the hips for a powerful reverse punch .

It took a further eight years before classes got under way ,  and then only in medicine ,  and it was not till well into the 1850s that it became really established .  It prospered and expanded under the principalship of Sir William Dawson ;  by the time he had completed 38 years as Principal  ( 18551893 )  the student body had risen from 100 to over 1000 ,  and Dawson had had the satisfaction of seeing great strides made in both the building programme and the various curricula  not least in his own scientific fields .  As well as academic achievements , McGill was noted for originating two major sports : ice hockey , in 1875 , largely from the rules written by J.G.A . Creighton ; and a species of rugby which was played by the citizens and soldiers ( for Montreal had <head>remained</head> a garrison town ) as well as the students . A McGill team introduced it to Harvard University in 1874 ,  which marked the formal birth of football .  Montrealers are not inclined to overlook their influence on Harvard !

If Soren Kierkegaard vitiated the easy - going philosophical idealism of his day with his heavily personalised challenges to it ;  if von Rochau brought in the concept of Realpolitik  to Bismarck 's  Germany ;  and if Karl Barth ushered in Crisis Theology in Switzerland ;  it is at least arguable that Irving Layton fathered Crisis Poetry in Canada :  poetry that demanded a decision ,  a response ;  that cut through the emollient patter and posed a rough demand on the reader or hearer .  In order to get that response he was prepared to dispense with the niceties of convention and the formulae of polite language :  from the gut ,  to the gut .  It was exactly what Leonard expected of a poet , and he and Layton have <head>remained</head> firm friends ever since . ( Moreover ,  he was ,  like Lorca ,  another L  and that could not be merely coincidental !  )  Indeed ,  the relationship has been more than mere friendship ,  but one of familial depth .

Ondaatje perceived this and described the book as being far nastier and more frightening than Flowers For Hitler  ;  but the choice of words is unjust :  there is nothing nasty or frightening about honest observation .  Such value - judgments surely arise out of the critics '  disappointment at finding negative aspects in an otherwise positive projection ,  an all -   to   - human aspiration for avoiding reality which Leonard refuses to do ,  to his great cost .  Manzano has drawn attention to a real difference when he says ( of both these first books ) , In general Cohen is lyrical in his writings when he refers to himself , and anarchistic when he confronts the outside world , a comment which becomes more fully justified as time goes by , though Leonard 's anarchism <head>remained</head> personal and mainly verbal . He is wont to talk of the new vision that Lorca 's  poetry gave to him ;  here is my landscape ,  he exclaimed repeatedly .  But that other landscape ,  quieter perhaps ,  but like an underground stream ,  unconscious and very persistent ,  never failed to obtrude itself on him :  It is strange that even now prayer is my natural language ,  he said ,  in Lines From My Grandfather 's  Journal  ( The Spice - Box Of Earth ,  p10 )  which powerfully reflect his own self - questionings ;  the tyranny was asserting itself .

Descartes believed firmly that universals were formed in the mind and that ideas possessed objective and formal reality ;  that is ,  that it was an irreducible feature of ideas that they were able to be about  a class of objects .  Descartes is true to his radical dualism :  everything that is a mark of mind is withdrawn into the mind ,  leaving the external world in atomistic darkness .  But mind <head>remains</head> truly special . The materialist Hobbes ,  by contrast ,  denies that universality is really found even in the mind :  This word universal  is never the name of anything existent in nature ,  nor of any idea or phantasm found in the mind  my italics ,  but always the name of some word or name ;  so that when a living creature ,  a stone ,  a spirit  ,  or any other thing ,  is said to be universal  ,  it is not to be understood that any man ,  stone etc. ,  ever was or can be universal ,  but only that the words ,  living creature ,  stone ,  etc. ,  are universal names  ,  that is ,  names common to many things ;  and the conceptions answering them in the mind are the images and phantasms of several living creatures or other things .

It reduces language to an uninterpreted formal system .  All we know about As ,  for example ,  is that they have relation to R to Bs ,  relation R ' to Cs ,  relation R '  to Ds ,  etc ;  and similarly for our understanding of Bs ,  Cs and Ds ,  and the variety of Rs .  What any of these things is like in itself , even the qualitative nature of the spatial medium of the relations , <head>remains</head> unknown . It is not surprising that reductive treatment of consciousness should have this effect .  In consciousness alone is it possible to confront at least some empirical properties and apprehend them directly ,  and if consciousness is analysed in terms of some purely non - mental notion this grasp is lost ;  just as ,  in the analysis of thought ,  if the irreducible generality of thought is analysed away ,  our ability to think and refer is wished away with it .

( This implies of course that consciousness in animals is a hypothesis for which there can be no evidence at all unless we resort to anthropomorphism ,  which we usually do .  )  Most psychologists accept that cognitive processes ,  and therefore mind  although this is a term not widely used in the brain sciences  -  encompass both conscious and unconscious activities .  Clearly , conscious processes are central to an individual 's own experience , but most of us <head>remain</head> neutral as to whether they are central to cognitive processes given that many , if not most , of these are not conscious . It also follows from this that understanding consciousness would not be sufficient for understanding mental processes .  So current cognitive models of language ,  memory ,  perception and so forth are also basically neutral to the question of consciousness .

This exchange of energy explains how we perceive the world .  This is now so widely accepted that it seems less like a theory ,  or even a theoretical framework ,  than a piece of common sense ;  and in one form or another it encompasses the views of the majority of Anglo - American philosophers and neuroscientists about the basis of consciousness or ,  at the very least ,  of perception .  Although some philosophers and psychologists would emphasize the role of action in controlling perception ( see chapter 2 ) and some talk of top down constraints on the interpretation of the perceived , the causal role of incident energy <head>remains</head> fundamental and the materialist version of the CTP essentially unchallenged . The neurophysiological  version of the CTP ,  with which we are concerned here ,  holds that perception is the result of the constant interaction between the material world and the nervous system .  In particular ,  perceptual awareness ,  and so consciousness itself ,  is identified with certain events taking place in the higher reaches of the central nervous system where a chain of events ,  collectively described as sensory processing ,  and originating from the object that is perceived ,  reaches a terminus .

For all the damage ,  though ,  the fire has  brought unexpected benefits .

Not that the eighties were without their problems :  quite apart from the industrial recession of the early years ,  which affected all Railfreight 's  bulk traffics to some degree or other ,  there was the historic miners '  strike of 19845 ,  taking heavy toll of steel as well as coal carryings .  Happily the coal traffic was revived to the point where pre - strike tonnages were exceeded ,  although the number of individual collieries served was vastly reduced .  The merry - go - round system which allows loading and discharge to take place while an entire train <head>remains</head> in motion has continued to form the mainstay of Railfreight Coal 's operations , and it is difficult to imagine a more efficient alternative . Railborne steel traffic suffered in proportion to the cutbacks in the steel industry itself ,  with complete withdrawal from one or two locations such as Consett in County Durham .  Interestingly ,  though ,  Railfreight also derived some benefit from the contraction of British Steel 's  steel - making activities .

But standing out above all are the scores commissioned from Stravinsky by Balanchine ,  such as Apollo ,  Orpheus  and Card Game  .  During the third phase of his enterprise Diaghilev realised the need to keep up with the tastes of his wealthy audiences always anxious to be in fashion and commissioned works from members of the group known as Les Six .  These were Milhaud , Poulenc and Auric whose music greatly influenced many later composers such as William Walton and Constant Lambert , many of their works <head>remain</head> in constant use today as witness MacMillan 's moving interpretation of Poulenc 's Gloria . When choreographers decide to commission music ,  they should first give the composer an outline of the plot ,  roughly suggesting the sequence of the action ,  the likely entrances and exits for the characters and the dances or brief scenes in which they are involved .  Secondly ,  some description should be given of the characters ,  their moods ,  emotions and particular role in each part of the action .

There are few ,  if any ,  suggestions of how individual movements can be linked together to achieve some expressive or rhythmic quality suitable to the style of dance required by the plot ,  theme and/or music .  if choreographers wish to make their design more interesting they should attempt to give each step and pose some distinctive quality or unusual place in the design ,  which may or may not break the old conventions .  As Fokine said : There can never be revolution in dance , only evolution , because the human body <head>remains</head> as it always has been , a living apparatus which can only move in certain well - defined ways . Choreographers should remember that the descriptions in any dictionary of steps only indicate the beginning ,  passing through and end of a single item .  There is no linkage ,  no indication of how to amalgamate one step with another and no indication of either rhythm or quality to make the movement come alive .

In every enchanement  each step an/or pose must be given its appropriate value by way of beginning ,  climax and end so that its place is justified by its importance to the whole sentence .

They were not creative artists but they were and still <head>remain</head> for the most part arbiters of technique and the niceties of perfect performance . The originality of so much of   Ashton 's  and MacMillan 's  choreography fur classical ballets lies in the way they follow the basic principles and rules in order to create an infinite variety of enchanements  from the traditional vocabulary of steps ,  and yet discard the conventions .

All go together  ( The Royal Ballet )  Ashton ,  too ,  has made vivid use of occupational gesture from time to time as ,  for example ,  when his Swiss Miss milks her cow with the help of the three boys in Faade  .  One of his finest examples of occupational gesture as the foundation of a ballet <head>remains</head> Les Patineurs . Here he creates the many happy and not so happy incidents that can occur on a skating rink where even a professional can miss a trick .  Jerome Robbins has a knack of using occupational gesture in many of his works and most particularly in The Concert  ,  where the well - observed behaviour of the many different concert - goers arouses much laughter .

Even the family room may not be strictly legal .  Everything is open to interpretation ,  usually by the police ,  and the poor ,  hard - pressed licensee and his customers are so confused that the usual solution is to avoid the problem and not let children into the pub at all .  While we must support family rooms in those pubs which have the space and can provide suitable amusement for the little angels , this cannot <head>remain</head> the only answer to the problem . Family rooms are useful to let the less well - behaved and noisier children run riot but they are frequently cold and characterless and ,  no matter how good the facilities may be ,  you often feel excluded from the main atmosphere of the pub .  I WOULD rather take my children into the main bar or lounge of a pub and expect them to sit sensibly and reasonably quietly so that we can all relax ,  drink ,  talk and eat in a proper pub atmosphere .

The East End was also the place where India Pale Ale was invented .  Docklands historians say it was first shipped out to thirsty expats in the Far East from Hodgson 's  brewery in Bow in 1734 .  Hodgson 's brewery , whose tap room in the Bow Road bore the name Bombay Grab , <head>remained</head> pre - eminent in the India beer trade until at least the 1820s . But the Hodgsons seem to have over - extended themselves and lost their monopoly on exporting beer to India ,  which was subsequently picked up by such upstarts as Bass .  The brewery itself eventually became ,  some time around 1847 ,  Smith Garrett and Company .

Mann 's <head>remained</head> famous for stouts and brown ales , and many other brewers sold its bottled brown ale , first introduced in 1899 . The brewery used horse - drawn drays for beer deliveries in and around the East End ,  and during the Second World War it was hit hard when a German land mine damaged the brewery stables ,  killing and injuring many of the horses .  BUT even in 1963 the brewery still had 25 heavy horses delivering beer in London .

Fry was a connoisseur of Renaissance art ,  but also he defended Post - Impressionism  ( a term he invented )  ,  was a painter ,  and published a monograph on Czanne .  In 1933 he wrote as follows in a lecture at Cambridge University :  An enormous amount of work has been done and perhaps still more <head>remains</head> to be done in arranging works of art in exact sequence of time . It is here that the Germans have done so much pioneer work ,  and indeed the whole tendency of their art historical studies has been to regard works of art almost entirely from a chronological point of view ,  as coefficients of a time sequence ,  without reference to their aesthetic significance .  The title of the lecture in which these words appeared was Art - history as  an Academic Study ,  but those were early days for the subject in the British Isles ;  only in London was there undergraduate teaching ,  at the Courtauld Institute which opened in 1933 .

Moreover ,  His role shifted easily from the alienated critic writing art columns for intellectual magazines to an impresario in the New York art - world judged by his commitment to a specific type of art and respected for its ultimate  ( commercial and influential )  success .  Greenberg 's  articles are marked by a confident authority ,  as in the following passage .  Looser paint - handling , combined with what <head>remained</head> an essentially Cubist sense of design , drawing , layout , was what artists as different as Gorky and Pollock had in common during the mid - 1940s . If the term Abstract Expressionist means anything verifiable ,  it means painterliness :  loose ,  rapid handling ,  or the look of it ;  masses that blot and fuse instead of shapes that stay distinct ;  large ,  conspicuous rhythms ;  broken  color  ;  uneven saturations or densities of paint ;  exhibited brush ,  knife ,  finger or rag marks  in short a constellation of physical features like those defined by Wlflinn when he extracted his notion of the Malerische  from Baroque art .  As we can now see ,  the displacing of the linear and quasi - geometrical as the dominant mode in New York  ( and Parisian )  abstract art after 1943 offers another instance of that cyclical alternation of non - painterly ,  or linear ,  and painterly which has marked the evolution of Western art since the sixteenth century .

He wrote :  Paolo Uccello would have been the most delightful and imaginative genius since Giotto that had adorned the art of painting ,  if he had devoted as much pains to figures and animals as he did to questions of perspective ,  for ,  although these are ingenious and good in their way ,  yet an immoderate devotion to them causes an infinite waste of  time ,  fatigues nature ,  clogs the mind with difficulties ,  and frequently renders it sterile where it had previously been fertile and facile .  But when Uccello died in his eighties , He left a daughter who could design , and a wife who used to say that Paolo would <head>remain</head> the night long in his study to work out the lines of his perspective , and that when she called him to come to rest , he replied , Oh what a sweet thing this perspective is ! Mathematical perspective of a Renaissance sort had not been used in European medieval art ,  where the size of a figure often derives from the person 's  importance ,  God the father never being small .  A perspective may be used which reverses the convergence of lines in the distance ;  instead ,  lines of perspective converge in front of the viewer ,  an unexpected phenomenon for a twentieth - century spectator used to photographs .

The dual division of ecclesiastical power has also been important because the religious orders have often been the vehicle for innovative theologies differing from the Roman line .  Because such religious orders are themselves controlled from Rome ,  Roman discipline is conveyed via a route other than by the bishops .  Even so , some orders still <head>remain</head> slightly independent from Rome , particularly the religious orders of solemn vows , whose existence preceded the reformation . Their numbers include the Augustinians and Dominicans ,  both of whom have been influential in Ireland and have produced theologians of liberal or left persuasion .  Despite their dependency on Rome ,  the jesuits too have been important innovators on the contemporary scene in Ireland ,  particularly in the areas of education for ecumenism and industrial relations .

Nevertheless the predominant catholic power lies with the hierarchy and secular clergy .  Thus ,  while it is possible to identify liberal catholicism in Ireland from the late nineteenth century to the present ,  and though there has grown up a climate of liberal dissent and criticism of conservative catholicism ,  it is still possible to assert the prominence of conservative catholicism ,  particularly in its alliance with nationalism .  The predominant political religious form was and <head>remains</head> , with some modifications and with increasing opposition , a centralizing and conservative catholicism . The protestant churches in Ireland also retained their island - wide organization after the political partition of the island .  The church  of Ireland still has one all - island synod ,  the presbyterians a single general assembly ,  the methodists one conference .

We reiterate :  the dominant beliefs of the alliances which we have termed historical blocs are not necessarily shared by all but are promoted successfully by dominant groups and have some grounding in the consciousness of the wider membership .  Thus ,  Irish nationalism is conceived by most members in an abstract way ,  but it has concrete import for key groups .  Equally , a particular type of catholic identity may not belong to all but <head>remains</head> politically dominant for similar reasons . The outcome of the dominance of both is that historically there have been critical mediations between religion and politics for catholic nationalists .  As will be seen in the remaining chapters ,  a particular form of Irish catholicism known as monopoly catholicism has assisted in the concrete success of the mix of the beliefs with economic beliefs in capitalism ,  ownership of land ,  and inheritance ,  helping to bring the elements to an explicit formulation in the 1937 Irish constitution ,  which has ever since shown considerable resistance to reformulation .

This is one of the special characteristics of catholicism ,  and is found to a much lesser extent in non - episcopal traditions .  Failure to conform to directives of priests and bishops were seen to break the very fabric of communion and to allow sin to enter in .  This <head>remains</head> particularly so today where an objectivist stance on morality prevails in a national or local culture anywhere in the catholic world . From within this perspective bishops and clergy lay down rules for the laity to follow in any given situation and the teaching of the church is seen as absolutely clear and devoid of problematic .  Rules are enforced rather than principles declared .

In the Roman catholic account ,  Christ appoints Peter to lead the church he has founded .  In the other ,  the church is founded but taken over early on by the Popes in Rome and by priests who use magic and ritual to gain control of God 's   people ,  thus profaning his divine word .  For the one version , the Reformation is the catastrophe by which half Christendom defects from the church , the church itself <head>remaining</head> intact and faithful to Peter . This version still predominates among Roman catholic laity in most countries .  For the popular protestant version ,  one which is still shared probably by a majority of clergymen within the protestant denominations of the North ,  the church re - emerges after centuries of misguidance only with the Reformation .

The protestant version has variants as to how pure this church is or whether it <head>remains</head> sinful , but the evangelical version which is the basic one in the North of Ireland opts absolutely for Jesus Saves ; the community , no longer medium of salvation , tends to take on a visible , earthly role , an occasion of grace and a support for religious this - worldly activity . Rome is seen to continue on its headlong path to misery and sin ,  a symbol of the rejection of Christ for the sake of human idols .  However ,  the earthly role of the community ,  be it protestant or catholic ,  is not seen as secondary to the religious message ,  but as either in continuity with or against it .

The change in the socio - moral context was hardly recognized ,  and the corresponding change in religious social ethics had remained unformulated .  In the case of the Mother and Child scheme ,  it was rather through withdrawal from the scene that first the politicians and later the churchmen avoided further trouble .  As will be elaborated now in further contexts , it appears that the underlying reality to such difficulties was , and <head>remains</head> a complex contradiction which the catholic nationalist alliance has still failed to solve . On the one hand there were the beliefs in the nature and extent of the clergy 's  political religious power and how that power was to be exercised in the state .  There was also the general assumption that the fact of a state populated by catholics must perforce imply a heightened degree of institutionalized catholic  value in law.

It should be added here that the high clergy hardly recognized that they had actually been exercising a political religious power of a specifically sectarian or monopolistic type .  Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate ,  they meant they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state .  But they did and still do <head>remain</head> the authoritative conscience of the nation . In addition ,  the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships ,  doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues .  Part of the overall argument of this book is that ,  as the Roman catholic church is principal validator or legitimator of the Southern state along with the concept of the national entity ,  what that state goes on to do in the field of social ethics cannot be separated out from the responsibilities of the church .

Furthermore ,  the ranks of that clergy were drawn from the common people themselves .  But a key element <head>remained</head> the considerable filial loyalty the catholic nationalists showed towards their clergy , bishops , and Popes . The  authority of the clergy had been second to none during the years of persecution and this appears to have strengthened as a direct result of Roman centralization from the 1850s onwards .  This respect for authority has appeared throughout the examples given ,  but it has also been shown to be a respect within certain limits .

From 1899 ,  the intention of the clergy to assume and maintain absolute control of their schools led a number of them to refuse to appoint members of the Irish National Teachers '  Organization so as to avoid trade union interference .  The result was that the union became subordinated for some time to the hierarchy and a breakaway union of protestant teachers was formed .  Despite the curtailment of some of the clergy 's powers , friction between the teachers ' associations , particularly the INTO , and the Roman catholic clergy has <head>remained</head> until this day . Clergy control of the schools had indeed become a priority for the church leadership .  The understanding reached between them and the catholic  nationalist lay leadership resulted in schooling in the future state being allocated to the domain of the church ,  in exchange for the legitimation of that state by the church leadership .

The present interrelationship between control of the schools and the two alliances varies in each part of Ireland ,  though one should also bear in mind the additional underpinning of the alliances both North and South by one of the traditional values of bourgeois capitalism ,  private and selective schooling .  Throughout Ireland as a whole ,  there has generally been an anti - comprehensive ethos in the education system supportive of both class and sectarian divisions in schooling and which is now eroding only in part .  In Northern Ireland , the catholic schools ' sector is provided for out of state funds , and <head>remains</head> under the governorship of the local clergy , now assisted by laity and members of the local educational and library boards . Many Roman catholic schools up to 1968 were financed for capital expenditure by the local church as part of the church 's  determination not to lose control of them .  The chairman of the board is usually the parish priest or his curate .

An appeal made to Rome in 1977 by the Roman catholic parents concerned with the Confirmation ban appeared to have been answered in their favour ,  as Bishop Philbin changed his pastoral policy and these children were allowed to go forward for confirmation in 19789 .  A notable achievement of ACT has been the passing of the Education  ( Northern Ireland )  Act of 1978 ,  permitting the establishment of multi - denominational schools where such is desired by adequate numbers of parents .

The Lamb ,  a picturesque village pub closed some years ago by Allied ,  was reopened in 1989 as a free house after an extensive remodelling  which involved the complete gutting of the original unexceptional but characterful ,  partitioned interior .

Some kill on contact and are then rendered ineffective , whereas systemic ( translocated ) chemicals are absorbed into the plant 's system and <head>remain</head> active for much longer , which could delay the harvest of fruit and vegetables .

Its status or  ( as importantly )  its lack of value creates complex systems of meaning which are rarely articulated ;  for the police world has similar strictures to that which Benedict  ( 1967 )  described in her attempts to understand the rigidities of Japanese culture :  men who have accepted a system of values by which to live ,  cannot without courting in - efficiency and chaos keep for long a fenced - off portion of their lives where they think and behave according to a contrary set of values .  Anthropological modes of enquiry are therefore programmed to steer us through the assumptions of police society , so that contradictions no longer <head>remain</head> incomprehensible . The cultural baggage which any social group ,  tribe ,  or institution such as the police acquires over time can thus be translated to reveal just what sustains it ,  and furthermore reveal what the society itself may not even have understood .  Where there does exist a genuine public expression of concern about the way the police operate this cannot just be dismissed as a matter of misunderstanding or be written off as the foolish ramblings of that police folk devil the loony left ,  who would dismantle the system for their own political ends .

Its frenzied rejection was very different to that of the many projects listed in the Police Foundation or Home Office Registers of Research mentioned above ,  most of which are simply ignored and never ever receive any review .  I believe the denial of the PSI report and the furore it caused occurred precisely because it managed to get beneath the surface of police culture to explore the deep structures of belief and to comment adversely about their influence on police activities .  The invisibility in the written record , which Shapland and Hobbs ( 1989 ) observed , and the unrecorded information which Chatterton told the conference <head>remained</head> hidden in the heads of the constables are the result of cultural values , which are then brought to bear to deny validity to these agendas . It is worth noting the language in the Federation rebuttal of the PSI report ,  for it illustrates how the culture is programmed to sneer at the graphic literary phrase and dismiss the use of anecdotal material as unscientific :  while participant observation is considered to be a world away from research based on safe  academic principles  ( my emphasis )  .  Police culture is omnipotent is structuring such views of critical research .

This total reverence to the group binds ideas of silence ,  loyalty ,  and reticence together to create a positive category for belief and action and ,  in turn ,  links silence to other concepts of respect for the order of the institution .  In consequence ,  even the publication of an academic seminar paper carried out without formal approval could form a breach in the regulated structures of police existence and be subject to disciplinary control .  In such a world , the easy resolution of the ethical dilemma <head>remains</head> problematic , for as Anne Akeroyd ( 1984 : 134 ) recognizes there is not , nor ever likely to be any definitive agreement about the nature of either the problems or solutions facing the social scientist and the question of ethics . I have never completely resolved my own dilemma ,  for I do not think it has a simple resolution .  Unlike the natural sciences ,  which deal largely in results ,  the social sciences are rightly concerned for practice ,  perhaps because results are rarely possible in an exact mathematical sense .

Obviously concerned that his analysis of the negative influence of discipline on the efficiency of systems of communication might offend or incite displeasure ,  he avoided confrontation ;  but he need not have worried .

In the following three years the thesis <head>remained</head> on my desk , unrequested by anyone else . Any suggestions for improvements in communications or any critical findings it may have contained were negated by institutional neglect and the silence which Arendt  ( 1958 )  argues is a primary tool of authority operated to effect !  The police ,  of course ,  can never really be geared easily to incorporate structural challenge to their existing concepts of order and control ,  for they are set up to maintain the symbols and practice which has sustained the status quo .

Research in the police ,  Irving further asserts ,  is a matter of pragmatics ,  eliminating philosophical enquiry into systems of belief ,  or how the knowledge of an ideology is transformed into action .  In the end ,  only the action is viable ,  so that all these essays tend to match the inside ethnography and are nullified by neglect or have any contentious matter treated as privileged information ,  for as Templeton  ( 1980 :  904 )  argues the police fear that if you have a better understanding of society ,  you are in a better position to change it  the very exercise they are reluctant to engage in .  Those who do go public are disloyal and there are thinly veiled attempts to dismiss the value of any revelation they make , for they are expected to <head>remain</head> silent and uncritical . When Ronald Gregory ,  the ex - chief constable of West Yorkshire ,  said little or nothing new about the Yorkshire Ripper case in a series of newspaper articles ,  he was castigated in Police Review   ( 1 July 1983 )  and they republished a 1979 photograph of him when his loyalty was unquestioned .  John Alderson ,  the ex - chief constable of Devon and Cornwall has suffered even more from his subsequent public persona ,  because of a move into academia ,  some critical publications ,  and a flirtation with the political life .

Since this condemnation of research opportunity ,  few studies have penetrated deeply beneath the sensitive skin of police culture ,  and even though Chatterton in his notes to my thesis argued there has been a considerable amount of participant police research ,  I would question whether many of these inquiries achieved the finer grain and detail ' of the insider 's  account ,  for they can never really know or tell if they have been excluded from the inner workings of police practice or prevented from gaining access to the hidden realities contained inside the heads of the constables .  Because of the litism which such an organization of control wields ,  it is not surprising there is difficulty in incorporating the outside researcher ,  or in accepting his critical findings .  And certainly that other main arm of executive control the army seems little better at this than the police , for the number of participant accounts of their deep structures <head>remains</head> negligible , supporting McCabe 's ( 1980 ) contention that we should be asking of all of these costly institutions , who is to be controlled by whom and for what reasons ? Meanwhile ,  as Reiner  ( 1985 )  suggests ,  the politicization of the police has proceeded at a pace ,  and can be illustrated by their growing willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy .  This trend is further displayed in their growing tendency to agree to be used as a pseudo - military arm of government in its socio - economic and industrial/political disputes with whole sections of society .

WPC Dick 's  salutary essay  ( 1985 )  changed little and generated few ripples on the ACPO pond ,  while one of the most powerfully critical books on policing in recent years  ( Jones 1980 )  seems to have had little effect on the structures of the organization ,  except ,  perhaps ,  to help draw its author  then a chief inspector  into the ACPO ranks .  Mervyn Jones  ( ibid .  )  ,  in this book on organizational  behaviors  ,  presented some glaringly uncomfortable findings .  Critical of the way that status is attributed by the institution , his thesis was that even as the service proclaims beat patrol work to be the basis of all good policework , it penalizes and stigmatizes those who <head>remain</head> there . The young officer ,  he concluded ,  must escape at the first opportunity or risk being classified as an unambitious no hoper at an early career stage .  A keenly stated desire to move into some area of specialization is a necessity ,  and ,  as a result ,  uniform patrol work becomes synonymous with failure and punishment .

Men get sent back  from specialist posts to uniform duties as a punishment and the strength of this metaphorical move downwards or backwards  ( you can never move up or forwards into uniform )  is not lost on young officers .

Jones 's book <head>remained</head> untouched on the shelves of Northumbria 's modest library in its first two years , even though it had good reviews ; and the influence of his research has been all but negligible . For even though some attempt to give status to the community or home beat officer has been made following Lord Scarman 's   ( 1981 )  report on the Brixton riots which gave something of a slap on the wrist to the service ,  the deference accorded to specialist posting or to detective work remains untouched .

Any need to analyse the ways in which the multi - variant police world forms a coherent and self - sustaining whole is material for the social scientist and not the practitioners ,  for they already live the system as a matter of course .  The police ,  therefore ,  have little to gain in promoting any exploration of their modes of thought ,  for analysis can only hold the possibility that the whole intricate system ,  to paraphrase Lvi - Strauss  ( 1967 )  ,  will be revealed as an immense disorder which is organised in the form of a grammar .  In consequence , police ethnography <head>remains</head> largely unwritten simply because it is unlikely the organization will be keen to reveal the ways this immense disorder is constructed , for it is not in their nature to allow other individuals to create their classifications for them . Indeed ,  institutional ideology sets out to strait - jacket minds and bodies and overcome individual thought  ( Foucault 1970 )  .

Like other symbolic non - verbal devices ,  the multi - vocal nuances of our uniform were used in a variety of other ways as boundary markers to maintain our cultural identity and define our institutional specificities .  Just as the white - coated doctors in hospitals symbolize the clean and purifying nature of the healer ,  so the dark uniform of the police symbolizes not just the force identity ,  but also the presence of the avenger ,  who purifies through retribution rather than by cure .  It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force police service which <head>remains</head> unresolved , on which I will say more later in relation to the role of women police officers . The dark uniform we wore had a military cap with polished brim ,  and in our fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boots we presented an avenging image ,  clothed in the symbolic colour of death and darkness .  Black is a light absorbent ,  non - reflective colour and most suitable for controllers who operate with a degree of social anonymity ,  upholding the rule of law and the abstractions of the legal system .

In such inversions of social regard we can again see how movement will tend to confound the police preference for and reliance on a rigidly maintained classificatory world .  The changing values attributed to our own private delicts such as divorce ,  slander ,  adultery ,  debt ,  libel ,  blasphemy ,  obedience to church ,  and the like ,  have turned some earlier crimes into matters now governed by other social mores .  With the public appropriation of certain categories of property , however , the police have been on more certain ground , for the status attributed to the capture of the thief has <head>remained</head> fairly constant , at least since the police were created as a public body . The detective therefore has a legitimate target in the thief  ( again the metaphor is based in militarism )  ;  and this is currently reinforced by the politics of materialism .  The statistical expansion of recorded crimes and a success largely determined by detection rates support the inevitable institutional contention that more control is a necessity ,  and has been a corner - stone in police ideology for the whole of my service .

In effect this was a time when new worlds and new social structures were being forged ;  and in many ways we were closer to the world of the underground than that of the moral majority ,  for we were walking the same ground and like many in the alternative society were  ( somewhat unsystematically )  following an essential and perennial theme of history  that of man 's  journey as hero .  In this search for a new spiritual awareness ,  they  like us  were finding new possibilities to achieve a revived sense of what it is to be truly human in the transformational experience .  This is basically the same anthropological journey pursued by Lvi - Strauss ( 1973 ) in Tristes Tropiques , which <head>remains</head> a suitable precursor for most of the current reflexive ethnography . In this account ,  Lvi - Strauss uses the hero 's  journey to self - analysis in the field as a means of achieving or engendering knowledge  ( see also Caplan 1988 )  ;  emphasizing that it is the journey to self - awareness itself ,  and not the arrival ,  which is the most important aspect of the rite de passage  .  The forces produced in the individual on such occasions ,  in what Jung  ( 1964 )  calls a journey to individuation ,  manifest themselves in a number of very persuasive ways and in this case led to some radical reassessments of the existing moral ,  philosophic ,  political ,  and aesthetic order .

When policemen label one of their colleagues with the term academic it is always a derogatory term of reference ,  while college  man is another derisory phrase used to define that tiny percentage who gain accelerated promotion through one of the special course or graduate entry schemes generated through the police staff college .  Whitaker  ( 1979 :  229 )  records how these college men are described sardonically at police station level ,  as plastic men  who know all about how to hold a knife and fork ,  but nothing about how to catch villains .  During a sojourn in Northumbria one of these academic high - flyers <head>remained</head> implacably not one of us , and I heard him summed up in the following terms : bloody man is in the fast - lane ;  comes off at junction 7 for a year or so here ,  and then he 'll be off and away at junction 8 ,  on to his chief 's  job somewhere else and look at him !

When deciding how wide to make your stance ,  look at yourself in a full length mirror to see what kind of a target you present for the opponent .  Narrow your stance and pull your rear hip back to try and reduce this profile ,  but notice also how this makes you gradually more and more susceptible to a foot sweep .  so , your rear hand has to be drawn further and further back from where it should be in order to <head>remain</head> immediately effective . I know of some competitors who fight from a fully sideways - facing straddle stance .  This stance has a very small target profile indeed ,  though it is wide open to the foot sweep and also reduces the competitor 's  choice of technique to the back fist or the side kick .

Carry the hand far enough forwards for immediate use as a reverse punch .  As before ,  the rear guard hand must never cross the body 's  centre - line .  Even during flurries of techniques , both hands <head>remain</head> on their respective sides of the centre - line . Arm movement Economy of arm movement is important since the more you flail them about ,  the longer it takes to cock them for an effective punch .

Many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the arm action .  A back fist will out - range a reverse punch performed by an opponent of equal height but it is not often scored because many referees do not consider it powerful enough .  Nevertheless it <head>remains</head> an excellent opening strike because , even more than the snap punch , it cocks the hips for a powerful reverse punch . However ,  all the time your shoulder leads ,  your centre - line is not facing the opponent ,  so you are vulnerable to a strong counter - attack .  Lean in behind the strike in order to get the maximum range ,  and raise your other hand as a guard .

Training To conclude this section it is necessary to point out a few things about the squad training sessions .  Firstly , karateka are not allowed to bring their own coaches with them to training sessions because experience has shown that the presence of other coaches breaks up the training atmosphere , and causes people to separate to far corners instead of <head>remaining</head> together . The second point is that you may be asked to take a drug test at any squad session .  If you refuse ,  you will be treated as though you had failed the test ,  and you will face a lifetime ban .

It took a further eight years before classes got under way ,  and then only in medicine ,  and it was not till well into the 1850s that it became really established .  It prospered and expanded under the principalship of Sir William Dawson ;  by the time he had completed 38 years as Principal  ( 18551893 )  the student body had risen from 100 to over 1000 ,  and Dawson had had the satisfaction of seeing great strides made in both the building programme and the various curricula  not least in his own scientific fields .  As well as academic achievements , McGill was noted for originating two major sports : ice hockey , in 1875 , largely from the rules written by J.G.A . Creighton ; and a species of rugby which was played by the citizens and soldiers ( for Montreal had <head>remained</head> a garrison town ) as well as the students .

If Soren Kierkegaard vitiated the easy - going philosophical idealism of his day with his heavily personalised challenges to it ;  if von Rochau brought in the concept of Realpolitik  to Bismarck 's  Germany ;  and if Karl Barth ushered in Crisis Theology in Switzerland ;  it is at least arguable that Irving Layton fathered Crisis Poetry in Canada :  poetry that demanded a decision ,  a response ;  that cut through the emollient patter and posed a rough demand on the reader or hearer .  In order to get that response he was prepared to dispense with the niceties of convention and the formulae of polite language :  from the gut ,  to the gut .  It was exactly what Leonard expected of a poet , and he and Layton have <head>remained</head> firm friends ever since . ( Moreover ,  he was ,  like Lorca ,  another L  and that could not be merely coincidental !  )  Indeed ,  the relationship has been more than mere friendship ,  but one of familial depth .

Ondaatje perceived this and described the book as being far nastier and more frightening than Flowers For Hitler  ;  but the choice of words is unjust :  there is nothing nasty or frightening about honest observation .  Such value - judgments surely arise out of the critics '  disappointment at finding negative aspects in an otherwise positive projection ,  an all -   to   - human aspiration for avoiding reality which Leonard refuses to do ,  to his great cost .  Manzano has drawn attention to a real difference when he says ( of both these first books ) , In general Cohen is lyrical in his writings when he refers to himself , and anarchistic when he confronts the outside world , a comment which becomes more fully justified as time goes by , though Leonard 's anarchism <head>remained</head> personal and mainly verbal . He is wont to talk of the new vision that Lorca 's  poetry gave to him ;  here is my landscape ,  he exclaimed repeatedly .  But that other landscape ,  quieter perhaps ,  but like an underground stream ,  unconscious and very persistent ,  never failed to obtrude itself on him :  It is strange that even now prayer is my natural language ,  he said ,  in Lines From My Grandfather 's  Journal  ( The Spice - Box Of Earth ,  p10 )  which powerfully reflect his own self - questionings ;  the tyranny was asserting itself .

Descartes believed firmly that universals were formed in the mind and that ideas possessed objective and formal reality ;  that is ,  that it was an irreducible feature of ideas that they were able to be about  a class of objects .  Descartes is true to his radical dualism :  everything that is a mark of mind is withdrawn into the mind ,  leaving the external world in atomistic darkness .  But mind <head>remains</head> truly special . The materialist Hobbes ,  by contrast ,  denies that universality is really found even in the mind :  This word universal  is never the name of anything existent in nature ,  nor of any idea or phantasm found in the mind  my italics ,  but always the name of some word or name ;  so that when a living creature ,  a stone ,  a spirit  ,  or any other thing ,  is said to be universal  ,  it is not to be understood that any man ,  stone etc. ,  ever was or can be universal ,  but only that the words ,  living creature ,  stone ,  etc. ,  are universal names  ,  that is ,  names common to many things ;  and the conceptions answering them in the mind are the images and phantasms of several living creatures or other things .

It reduces language to an uninterpreted formal system .  All we know about As ,  for example ,  is that they have relation to R to Bs ,  relation R ' to Cs ,  relation R '  to Ds ,  etc ;  and similarly for our understanding of Bs ,  Cs and Ds ,  and the variety of Rs .  What any of these things is like in itself , even the qualitative nature of the spatial medium of the relations , <head>remains</head> unknown . It is not surprising that reductive treatment of consciousness should have this effect .  In consciousness alone is it possible to confront at least some empirical properties and apprehend them directly ,  and if consciousness is analysed in terms of some purely non - mental notion this grasp is lost ;  just as ,  in the analysis of thought ,  if the irreducible generality of thought is analysed away ,  our ability to think and refer is wished away with it .

( This implies of course that consciousness in animals is a hypothesis for which there can be no evidence at all unless we resort to anthropomorphism ,  which we usually do .  )  Most psychologists accept that cognitive processes ,  and therefore mind  although this is a term not widely used in the brain sciences  -  encompass both conscious and unconscious activities .  Clearly , conscious processes are central to an individual 's own experience , but most of us <head>remain</head> neutral as to whether they are central to cognitive processes given that many , if not most , of these are not conscious . It also follows from this that understanding consciousness would not be sufficient for understanding mental processes .  So current cognitive models of language ,  memory ,  perception and so forth are also basically neutral to the question of consciousness .

This exchange of energy explains how we perceive the world .  This is now so widely accepted that it seems less like a theory ,  or even a theoretical framework ,  than a piece of common sense ;  and in one form or another it encompasses the views of the majority of Anglo - American philosophers and neuroscientists about the basis of consciousness or ,  at the very least ,  of perception .  Although some philosophers and psychologists would emphasize the role of action in controlling perception ( see chapter 2 ) and some talk of top down constraints on the interpretation of the perceived , the causal role of incident energy <head>remains</head> fundamental and the materialist version of the CTP essentially unchallenged . The neurophysiological  version of the CTP ,  with which we are concerned here ,  holds that perception is the result of the constant interaction between the material world and the nervous system .  In particular ,  perceptual awareness ,  and so consciousness itself ,  is identified with certain events taking place in the higher reaches of the central nervous system where a chain of events ,  collectively described as sensory processing ,  and originating from the object that is perceived ,  reaches a terminus .

His chief officers formed a board which had a very considerable measure of authority to determine its own ways  ( witness ,  for example ,  the Western Region 's  adventure with diesel - hydraulic locomotives when the remainder of British Railways was following the diesel - electric path ,  or  the Eastern Region 's  policy of civil engineering for speed )  .  An innovation in organisation sectorisation resulted in the regions losing their business roles and becoming purely the providers of services and facilities .

But some positive things happened in 1982 like the opening of Milton Keynes Central at a cost of 4.5million ;  Watton - at - Stone between Stevenage and Hertford North ;  and of Watford Stadium on the Watford Junction - Croxley Green branch on 4 December .  And it was in 1982 that David Kirby was appointed director of the new London  South East sector .

And technology was now offering a key to this problem also .  Modern cook - chill processes ,  using liquid nitrogen ,  chill partly cooked food very rapidly to just above freezing point at which temperature it will keep perfectly for several days. Heating in a simple convection oven is all that <head>remains</head> to do on board ; and this system , coupled with a range of basically similar ( modular ) trolleys formed the basis of Cuisine 2000 begun experimentally between Euston and Manchester in August 1985 . Modular catering cars retained an orthodox grill for that perennial favourite ,  the Great British Breakfast ,  which in 1987 accounted for 630,000 out of the total of 1.1 million main meals served .  Preparation of the food on shore now offered private contractors a foothold in the core of the business ,  and this in turn led in 1987 to the highly symbolic step of privatising the railway sandwich .

The yard was a product of piecemeal development over many years and found an important role in the air - braked wagonload network  ( Speedlink )  from the 1970s onwards .  It was a convenient gathering point for all non - trainload traffic to and from South Wales ,  and also became the gateway to south - west England with feeder services to Bristol ,  Exeter ,  Plymouth and so on .  Moreover it was not an under - used white elephant in the manner of Kingmoor yard in Carlisle ; traffic levels <head>remained</head> comparatively healthy right up to the end . In their quest to reduce costs ,  however ,  the Railfreight managers were keen to explore every way of streamlining their operations ,  and in the case of Severn Tunnel Junction it was found that total closure would bring substantial savings for relatively little inconvenience .  Most of the work previously carried out at Severn Tunnel Junction was transferred to Gloucester ,  Cardiff Tidal and East Usk  ( Newport )  yards ,  with Stoke Gifford  ( Bristol )  playing a minor role .

Not that the eighties were without their problems :  quite apart from the industrial recession of the early years ,  which affected all Railfreight 's  bulk traffics to some degree or other ,  there was the historic miners '  strike of 19845 ,  taking heavy toll of steel as well as coal carryings .  Happily the coal traffic was revived to the point where pre - strike tonnages were exceeded ,  although the number of individual collieries served was vastly reduced .  The merry - go - round system which allows loading and discharge to take place while an entire train <head>remains</head> in motion has continued to form the mainstay of Railfreight Coal 's operations , and it is difficult to imagine a more efficient alternative . Railborne steel traffic suffered in proportion to the cutbacks in the steel industry itself ,  with complete withdrawal from one or two locations such as Consett in County Durham .  Interestingly ,  though ,  Railfreight also derived some benefit from the contraction of British Steel 's  steel - making activities .

But standing out above all are the scores commissioned from Stravinsky by Balanchine ,  such as Apollo ,  Orpheus  and Card Game  .  During the third phase of his enterprise Diaghilev realised the need to keep up with the tastes of his wealthy audiences always anxious to be in fashion and commissioned works from members of the group known as Les Six .  These were Milhaud , Poulenc and Auric whose music greatly influenced many later composers such as William Walton and Constant Lambert , many of their works <head>remain</head> in constant use today as witness MacMillan 's moving interpretation of Poulenc 's Gloria . When choreographers decide to commission music ,  they should first give the composer an outline of the plot ,  roughly suggesting the sequence of the action ,  the likely entrances and exits for the characters and the dances or brief scenes in which they are involved .  Secondly ,  some description should be given of the characters ,  their moods ,  emotions and particular role in each part of the action .

There are few ,  if any ,  suggestions of how individual movements can be linked together to achieve some expressive or rhythmic quality suitable to the style of dance required by the plot ,  theme and/or music .  if choreographers wish to make their design more interesting they should attempt to give each step and pose some distinctive quality or unusual place in the design ,  which may or may not break the old conventions .  As Fokine said : There can never be revolution in dance , only evolution , because the human body <head>remains</head> as it always has been , a living apparatus which can only move in certain well - defined ways . Choreographers should remember that the descriptions in any dictionary of steps only indicate the beginning ,  passing through and end of a single item .  There is no linkage ,  no indication of how to amalgamate one step with another and no indication of either rhythm or quality to make the movement come alive .

In every enchanement  each step an/or pose must be given its appropriate value by way of beginning ,  climax and end so that its place is justified by its importance to the whole sentence .  This does not mean that today 's  choreographers need follow the conventions laid down by the Renaissance scholars who were more interested in the physical ability and behaviour of courtiers .  They were not creative artists but they were and still <head>remain</head> for the most part arbiters of technique and the niceties of perfect performance . The originality of so much of   Ashton 's  and MacMillan 's  choreography fur classical ballets lies in the way they follow the basic principles and rules in order to create an infinite variety of enchanements  from the traditional vocabulary of steps ,  and yet discard the conventions .

He must balance the movements one against the other to give proportion and emphasis as well as dimension .  Each gesture in a sequence must be carefully timed so that it is of proper value to the whole .  Once the sailor has climbed the rigging , which is usually an energetic process , he looks out , <head>remaining</head> stationary except for a slight sway as the boat sails out of harbour . Lise 's  dance when she sweeps the floor before helping Mother Simone to spin is an excellent example of how the subtle timing of gesture can be and is helped by the appropriate choice of music .  4

All go together  ( The Royal Ballet )  Ashton ,  too ,  has made vivid use of occupational gesture from time to time as ,  for example ,  when his Swiss Miss milks her cow with the help of the three boys in Faade  .  One of his finest examples of occupational gesture as the foundation of a ballet <head>remains</head> Les Patineurs . Here he creates the many happy and not so happy incidents that can occur on a skating rink where even a professional can miss a trick .  Jerome Robbins has a knack of using occupational gesture in many of his works and most particularly in The Concert  ,  where the well - observed behaviour of the many different concert - goers arouses much laughter .

Even the family room may not be strictly legal .  Everything is open to interpretation ,  usually by the police ,  and the poor ,  hard - pressed licensee and his customers are so confused that the usual solution is to avoid the problem and not let children into the pub at all .  While we must support family rooms in those pubs which have the space and can provide suitable amusement for the little angels , this cannot <head>remain</head> the only answer to the problem . Family rooms are useful to let the less well - behaved and noisier children run riot but they are frequently cold and characterless and ,  no matter how good the facilities may be ,  you often feel excluded from the main atmosphere of the pub .  I WOULD rather take my children into the main bar or lounge of a pub and expect them to sit sensibly and reasonably quietly so that we can all relax ,  drink ,  talk and eat in a proper pub atmosphere .

The East End was also the place where India Pale Ale was invented .  Docklands historians say it was first shipped out to thirsty expats in the Far East from Hodgson 's  brewery in Bow in 1734 .  Hodgson 's brewery , whose tap room in the Bow Road bore the name Bombay Grab , <head>remained</head> pre - eminent in the India beer trade until at least the 1820s . But the Hodgsons seem to have over - extended themselves and lost their monopoly on exporting beer to India ,  which was subsequently picked up by such upstarts as Bass .  The brewery itself eventually became ,  some time around 1847 ,  Smith Garrett and Company .

Mann 's <head>remained</head> famous for stouts and brown ales , and many other brewers sold its bottled brown ale , first introduced in 1899 . The brewery used horse - drawn drays for beer deliveries in and around the East End ,  and during the Second World War it was hit hard when a German land mine damaged the brewery stables ,  killing and injuring many of the horses .  BUT even in 1963 the brewery still had 25 heavy horses delivering beer in London .

However ,  the capitals '  sports - climbers were dismayed to discover that because of an agreement between Bendcrete and the Sobell to share profits from any organised competitions ,  a special sports licence was required for insurance purposes :  a licence which the sports centre lacked .

But , the width of the crack prevents this and the nut <head>remains</head> solid . The wires are soldered into the nut and the device appears well engineered .  One benefit of this over similar units is that the groove retains the semi - circular wedge ,  so it is hard to separate this moveable part from the nut .

More important ,  and very surprising ,  we are told that he did not repent of his crime .

Prison finds him longing to feel contrite ,  to feel he deserves his punishment ,  but only able to believe he has committed a simple blunder  which might have happened to anybody .
