The public perception of Amnesty has also changed and this has not happened by accident .  For a long time deemed a white ,  Western organization ,  the setting up of section sin countries like Tunisia ,  Algeria and South Korea ,  are ample illustration of Amnesty 's  worldwide stature .  As a multi - lingual movement the human rights message can be conveyed via dozens of reports , books and audio - visual materials to <head>audiences</head> from Japan to Nigeria . Amnesty is global in name and nature .  The very life blood of Amnesty is its research teams  there are currently 40 based at the International Secretariat in London .

Amnesty sections all over the world include the Prisoner Letter Writing Campaign cases in the magazines and newssheets they publish in many other languages ,  from Faroe to Banlga .

ARTISTS OWN WRITING Van Gogh is famous not only for his art ,  but for his writing .  He did not write an autobiography , but his letters have been a source of fascination to a wide <head>audience</head> , especially artists . Luckily ,  he had a correspondent in his brother Theo in whom he could confide and with whom he could explore ideas about art ;  the letters are thus an invaluable source of interpretation .  From the distance of a century ,  some of Van Gogh 's  enthusiastic appraisals of the art of his time look curious ;  but then ,  this artist acting as a critic was especially vulnerable to admiring art with a moral purpose ,  or work from which he was able to draw inspiration .

The variations and exceptions to these brief generalised statements can be found in a number of books ,  some by investigative outsiders ,  some in memoirs by dealers and others interested in the market .  For other periods ,  historians are slowly making studies which document the connections of critics and historians with the markets .  In 1959 Dore Ashton was dismissed by the New York Times , the charges being that her articles were not aimed at a wide newspaper <head>audience</head> , and her articles on work by artist friends gave evidence of bias ( her husband , whose work she was forbidden to review , was a painter and print - maker called Adja Yunkers ) . John Canaday ,  the incoming editor of the newspaper 's  art page and responsible for the dismissal ,  had made a challenge to a climate of opinion in which Dore Ashton 's  criticism was valued for its sensitivity ,  and where the art which she praised was accepted .  Her supporters included Thomas Hess ,  Meyer Schapiro ,  Leo Steinberg ,  Harold Rosenberg ,  and Peter Selz ,  and their intervention ,  asserting that Canaday had offended Ashton 's  rights and responsibilities as a critic ,  resulted in Canaday 's  being censured by the American art critics '  association .

The theatre is larger than life ,  not in terms of physical scale ,  but because movements and speech are comparatively emphatic and intense ,  even when a play simulates everyday natural surroundings .  Some people find this makes theatre less believable  less true to their own experience and therefore less convincing than the more restrained performances seen on television and cinema .  Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the <head>audience</head> are vitally connected to what is going on . As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself ,  and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for .  Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters  this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre  ( for example ,  look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 ,  scene 1 of Henry V  ,  which draws the audience into the atmosphere before a battle enormously effectively )  .

Your local amateur society is always a good beginning .  Being nervous and taking risks are two of the main things you will have to face as an aspiring actor ,  and that first time you read a play with a group of strangers ,  rather than in a classroom or among friends is when you confront your first hurdle .  But you may not actually learn much , simply because the main object of the group will not be to help you but to get on and do the play , relying on the skills available and hoping that the <head>audience</head> will give adequate support . So what else can you do ?

At nearly all schools no stage performances will be seen by an <head>audience</head> until at least the end of the second term . Sometimes students get anxious about this ,  and believe they are not making audience contact early enough ;  but if you think about it ,  the reasoning is clear .

Students may find themselves performing in final productions over two full terms ,  which means they have the opportunity to play twice as many parts ,  but this depends on the school 's  policy and how they think you have progressed .  At this stage ,  too ,  the allocation of parts and the standard of performance is becoming a lot more competitive  a foretaste of the profession itself .  In many cases students will also tour in productions mounted by the school , and this gives good <head>audience</head> experience away from the greenhouse of school performances , where the people who sit in the audience are usually either professionally interested , or are fellow students and friends . Any programme of final drama school productions will present a variety of styles and the casting is aimed at giving students a chance to do well in suitable roles .  Naturally ,  with a cast of actors who are all approximately the same age ,  the casting of heavy character parts has to be considered very carefully ,  and of course not all plays are teeming with characters of similar age .

Small , little - known groups do n't generally muster a large <head>audience</head> , of course , but they are often a good way of commanding interest from future employers .

Another outstanding Box feature was SIMON AND LAURA  ( 1956 )  a comedy about live television production starring Kay Kendall and Peter Finch whose wit and sharpness has not since been rivalled by films on similar themes .

They make deceptively subtle demands on their <head>audience</head> , and through all of them there runs a strong sense of humour . Her last film RATTLE OF A SIMPLE MAN  ( 1964 )  whose commercial and critical failure ended her career ,  can be seen as a woman 's  reply to the eulogies of the working class male celebrated by John Osbourne and his like ,  and it does so by poking fun at the ideology of the male and his crude sexism .  Ironically ,  this film stands up better today than many of its male social realist counterparts .

His ideas of symphonic development were followed by Beethoven  (  Prometheus  1801 )  ,  Adam  (  Giselle  1841 )  ,  Delibes  (  Copplia  1870 )  and Tchaikovsky .  Although the scores of The Sleeping Beauty  and The  Nutcracker  followed Petipa 's  explicit orders that each item consisted of so many bars of one tempo and time signature and as to what it was supposed to represent ,  Tchaikovsky did demonstrate how ballet music could be developed symphonically by using the leitmotifs .

Stravinsky composed the first truly modern score for ballet with The Firebird   ( see page 61 )  .

Ashton punctiliously followed the layout .  But Stravinsky 's  music ,  although classical in form ,  was far from the tuneful dance idioms of Tchaikovsky ,  Stravinsky 's  source of inspiration .  Despite strict rhythm and exact phrasing , the music was daringly frivolous in tone and quality because it was meant to entertain a popular <head>audience</head> . In following Stravinsky 's  guidelines ,  Ashton found many new ,  sometimes frivolous ,  ways of performing class - room steps .  The corps de ballet  neglect the turn - out and step forwards sur les pointes  ,  raising the working knee and resting the toe on the calf of the other leg ,  before moving forwards .

This told how the poet ,  having taken opium ,  dreamt backwards through time to seek his love in a ballroom ,  on his way to a medieval scaffold ,  at a well in ancient Greece and finally at a Witches Sabbath ,  where her kiss ended in death  ( see page 56 )  .  However ,  Massine 's  interpretation of Brahms '  fourth Symphony  ( Choreartium  ,  1933 )  was very different .  It was the ideas behind this design that so interested not only the <head>audience</head> but also the music critics of the time ( see page 41 ) . Massine not only paralleled the overall and short phrase rhythms of the music by those of the dancers ,  but the instruments of the orchestra by related groups of dancers .  Each group was led by a soloist representing the leader of a particular orchestral section so that as the themes were taken up by first one and then another section ,  the various groups of dancers joined in .

For example ,  when the musical phrases get complicated because of the use of many notes ,  the dancers find themselves using their hands feverishly in order to give every note its value .  Occasionally this can be interesting as it is in Bintley 's  Consort Lessons   ( 1984 )  .  But if it is repeated too often the incessant jigging of hands makes the <head>audience</head> restless , too . A study of Dalcroze Eurythmics from which such ideas emanate is valuable ,  but the practice must be used with discretion if the resultant ballet is not to resemble an examination of machinery rather than a feeling fur the rhythm and shape of the engine that makes the dancers perform .

Instead of concentrating on the lines of the dance  which they will need if they ever dance in Ashton 's  Symphonic Variations  or Monotones  ,  MacMillan 's  Requiem  or Bintley 's  Consort Lessons   students spend more time loosening up to meet the demands of modern choreographers .  There is often a rush to create something new without enough thought being given to the physical problems they may cause .  There remain , however , a few dancers who excel in the purely classical roles , which an <head>audience</head> demands because they are still testing grounds for particular talents . Purely classical ballets are still popular ,  so there have to be choreographers who understand and mould the technique .

Most other story ballets can be analysed in much the same way .  Those with a theme ,  or which consist of dance only ,  have a similar plan .  A choreographer who neglects the old rules and any item pertinent to the unfolding of the plot , theme or music is demanding a great deal from an <head>audience</head> . Many plotless or so - called abstract ballets ,  by choreographers such as Balanchine ,  have no specific characters or climaxes but they do follow the composer 's  score very closely .

This can be effected by the use of a leitmotif or phrases of music .  Since the first performance of Giselle  ,  certain composers and arrangers have used leitmotifs fur one or several characters and repeat the leitmotifs each time the characters appear .  These musical phrases give continuity to the action and are most valuable because they help both performers and <head>audience</head> to understand how moments in the story or theme affect the players . Adolphe Adam ,  composer of the music for Giselle  ,  initiated this idea which greatly influenced Wagner and later composers .  Leitmotifs are a firm point of reference that carries the dancer onwards from the     beginning to the climax and to the end of the story .

Choreographers can also take a more subjective view of their work .  This is equally important and has so proved throughout ballet history .

The names of four choreographers immediately stand        out .

No better example can be given than by citing the careers of Tamara Karsavina and Margot Fonteyn ,  both of whom worked with many different choreographers as well as submitting themselves to the severely classical discipline of the older Petipa repertoire .  A general view  There is a third type of choreographer who produces ballets which give <head>audiences</head> great pleasure through the sheer variety of their virtuoso designs . Because of the interesting ,  usually technical ,  demands made on the performers ,  their ballets often become testing grounds for future soloists .  Variations from such ballets as Petipa 's  Don Quixote ,  Raymonda  and La Bayadre  and Bournonville 's  Napoli  are still considered by most classical dancers to be more technically demanding than the more complex twistings and turnings of modern choreographers who mix their styles .

Measurable extent of any kind ;  number of unknown qualities contained as factors in a whole Dimension immediately suggests that the choreographer must take into account the space in which the dancers move .  Although this is of considerable importance , particularly if the ballet is to be presented in a large theatre , too much concentration on certain of the dimensions ( height , depth or breadth ) may deprive some members of the <head>audience</head> of much of the pattern . for example ,  too much weaving and rolling of bodies on the floor is hardly visible from the stalls ,  whilst too much concentration on one side of the stage finds spectators on the same side craning their necks to see what is going on .  It was for such reason that most of Petipa 's  famous pas de deux  take place centre stage ,  whilst those of Ashton and MacMillan cover the whole area as befits their more flowing lyrical styles ,

Once an outline of the story and a general layout of the plot have been decided ,  they should be discussed with the composer or arranger of music whose first task may be to create a proper beginning with the overture .  Is it to set the general atmosphere and mood as Stravinsky did for The Firebird  Mysterious sounds of the wind whispering in the trees ,  the soaring flight of a bird and the heavy tread of an unseen foot are still a wonderful introduction to this magic tale .  On the other hand , Prokofiev used his overture to Romeo and Juliet to introduce the leitmotifs which will help both dancers and <head>audience</head> to follow the unfolding of the plot . He contrasts the love themes of Romeo and Juliet with those which accompany the bitter struggles and fights between Montague and Capulet .

Despite the general activities there is menace in the air and it is not long before the rival factions of Montagues and Capulets are fighting and deaths occurring before the lovers even meet .  This opening is very different from the quietly charming first scene of A Month in the Country  ,  where the only thing amiss is Natalia 's  bored behaviour .  Even with such examples in mind the choreographer may well decide it is better to delay the confrontation between the chief players because , by creating and stressing the general atmosphere , this raises the <head>audience</head> 's expectations before the meeting of the protagonists , and the sudden onset of passion is what makes the ultimate tragedy so poignant . This happens in Giselle  where Hilarion 's  suspicions of Albrecht 's  identity are already aroused before Albrecht meets Giselle .  Hilarion 's  discovery of Albrecht 's  sword and later his confrontation with Giselle ,  with the sword in his hands ,  still does not convince Giselle of Albrecht 's  duplicity .

Despite the great differences in style between the above three ballets and despite their different libretti the three choreographers perrot  ( with Saint - Georges )  ,  MacMillan and Ashton give valid reasons why the tragic deaths of Giselle ,  Romeo and Juliet ,  and Natalia 's  lost love are the inevitable result of what has gone before .  In other words ,  what happens at the beginning of the story states why the relationships between two or more characters lead to confrontations which continue onwards to a climax and finally draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion .  This last task is possibly the most difficult because the <head>audience</head> must be convinced that the ending chosen is the only possible outcome of everything that has gone before . The ending can also owe a great deal to the composer or arranger of music .  Stravinsky ensures a happy yet solemn ending to The Firebird  by using the old Easter hymn At the Gate where the whole congregation rejoices at the renewal of life .

The style must disclose and be expressive of the moods ,  emotions and actions of the roles played even where few personal feelings are allowed to show ,  as in such ballets as Ashton 's  Monotones  where all that is needed is a calm ,  unhurried and seemingly endless weaving of the dance design in all its dimensions .

A contradiction in style during this change of aulement  or alignment can distort the design .

He then gives an entirely new quality to the class - room exercise on which these enchanements  are based.

By 1717 these gestures were accepted practice by actors to reinforce the meaning of the words spoken and particularly by members   of the commedia dell'arte travelling troupes who produced mime plays .  In these the expert gestures and extemporised playing of easily recognised characters in certain stock situations were understood by <head>audiences</head> everywhere no matter what the native language because the gestures were so explicit . These gestures were first listed by monks in the tenth century .  They described some four hundred used by monks and nuns of certain religious orders during the hours of silence .

Those in the <head>audience</head> who have had to suffer such behaviour in a concert hall , whilst trying to listen to a brilliant musician , know that his remarks about certain characters are only too true . Whatever occupational gesture  ( mime )  a choreographer chooses to use in ballet ,  it must be envisaged in terms of dance without the use of props .

composers ,  authors ,  poets and painters ,  began to strengthen the national features of their work .  More typical and traditional folk dance steps and customs were absorbed into demi - caractre  dance and were accompanied by idiomatic features from national music .  When this happened , however , even the traditional features became more stereotyped because choreographers used only those which the <head>audience</head> could easily recognise and which were commonly seen and heard in a particular country . It was from such traditional dance that Fokine ,  at the instigation of Diaghilev ,  devised the first truly national ballets by breaking away from the sterotyped steps .  Instead ,  Fokine based his design  ( as did the composer Stravinsky and the artist Korovin  ( later Goncharova )  )  on the folk tales ,  customs ,  traditional dances and music of Russia without in any way conforming to the generally accepted rules of classical technique .

His dance throughout has its base in the classical vocabulary but MacMillan has coloured it by gestures from cabaret and vaudeville dance traditions ,  which serve to reveal not only class  differences in behaviour but also genuine feelings .  This is why Bratfisch is so important .  Without him there is no other character with whom the <head>audience</head> can feel sympathy . Ashton 's  Alain shows yet another aspect of the sad clown or little man and can ,  when subtly played ,  gain much sympathy because ,  while things seem to go right ,  he is so pleased with life .

MacMillan 's  The Burrow  ,  based on the real diary of Anne Frank ,  was possibly the most explicit and moving of all his efforts to depict reality in terms of dance  ( see page 30 )  .  The classification of today 's  ballets becomes more difficult as their stories ,  themes and music get more complicated .  Very occasionally , the opposite happens , e.g. in Robbins ' Glass Pieces to John Cage 's minimal music , the constant repetition of musical phrases paralleled by dance phrases lost the interest of an <head>audience</head> bored with too much meaningless to - ing and fro - ing .

In these cases the interests of justice may demand special requirements such as ,  for example ,  that the preparation and presentation of the case be in separate and independent hands .  In the second category ,  general civil cases ,  parties should be able to choose their own lawyers because the interests of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's  right of choice .  Lord Donaldson implied , however , that solicitors who exercised their new rights of <head>audience</head> in these cases ought to be expected to concentrate on advocacy . While emphasising that he had not reached any firm conclusions ,  Lord Donaldson 's  voice will be a powerful one in behind - the - scenes manoeuvres as rules governing the exercise of the new advocacy rights are hammered out away from the parliamentary battlefield .  The rules will be drawn up by the Law Society having regard to suggestions made by a new lay - dominated independent advisory committee on legal education and conduct .

But on the other hand ,  the statute will also include a clear intention that extended rights of audience are put into practical effect as soon as the necessary conditions have been met .  A majority of judges said in their response to the Green Papers that standards of conduct and competence might decline if lawyers who worked in partnerships and took instructions directly from clients  ( most solicitors )  were allowed widespread access to the higher courts .  Lord Donaldson 's formula for settling the rights of <head>audience</head> controversy was viewed as an adept political move by some delegates . Alternative dividing lines which have been informally mooted ,  such as simply restricting solicitor - advocates in Crown Court jury trials to the less serious cases ,  had been viewed as difficult to support as a matter of principle .  Lord Donaldson 's  remarks were greeted with cautious enthusiasm by Bar leaders .

Suddenly she caught sight of the child 's  mother .  Immediately ,  her expression and pace of approach changed and instead of the lambasting ,  or worse ,  she had seemed about to deliver ,  she gave the child a tolerant smile and began to pick up the scattered cans .  Most of us have experienced similar examples of such <head>audience</head> effects on behaviour : playing a game to perfection ( or otherwise ) when the team selector is present , for instance . What you do depends very much on who might be watching ,  often with good reason .

A PAIR of tramps in the cellar of an abandoned hotel lengthily airing their psychological underwear until evicted by a  ( superficially )  heartless boilerman :  we seem to have been here before .  But there is not much Pinter ,  and definitely no Beckett ,  about this solid piece of middle - class music theatre by the Canadian composer Quenten Doolittle ,  which began its short British tour by the Banff Music Theatre at the Chapter Arts Centre ,  Cardiff .  Doolittle has based himself on what seems a pellucidly consequential and intelligently written play by Rex Deverell ( also the librettist ) ; and though the piece is offered as best suited to alternative <head>audiences</head> , it cuts an oddly respectable figure in the modestly louche surroundings of Chapter . Two reasons strike me for this .  First ,  the work is dramaturgically polite ;  it consults its audience too much to be taken seriously as drop - out theatre .

Neither club was pleased ,  supporters were furious and Liverpool were reported to have protested strongly .

What we were offered ,  if definition is needed ,  might be called ballet - pantomime :  it was certainly not opera .  As in the best ballet - pantomimes ,  the message is direct in origin and presentation .  At times the method is decidedly crude , especially in a hint of West Side Story which concludes the overture , doubtless aimed at today 's <head>audience</head> . Oddly enough ,  Ghanashyam  ( A Broken Branch )  approaches opera in the nature of the story it tells :  originating in village festivities ,  the tale unfolds a rake 's  progress towards perdition ,  in this case via drugs ,  but with an extra metaphysical twist when the spirit of the departed returns to inhabit his wife .  While the intentions of the plot are clear enough ,  it is not significantly developed by the dance .

But Holland 's  particular trademark is a cute and cloying sentimentality ,  with pathos laid on thick .  Her story - telling has no obliqueness , no mystery ; everything is slowly and patiently explained , as though the <head>audience</head> was a fidgety bunch of six - year - olds . The two directors have done their best ,  speeding the tale along on the wings of Bessie Smith and mouth - organ blues .  And the actresses themselves are a delight :  Josette Bushell - Mingo has an extraordinarily mobile face and an infectiously comic manner ,  Joy Richardson shows an uncanny ability to get inside a 10 - year - old 's  skin ,  and Angela Bruce ,  as the mother ,  has natural authority .

By not uttering a word to the <head>audience</head> , then keeping the stage shrouded in smoke , lit only from the back in lurid purple , orange and red , and reducing the band to shadowy figures looming out of a fog , he put so much distance between them and anybody past the regulation front - of - stage pogoers that attention easily wandered . And the over - use of an extra microphone ,  giving his voice the qualities of a US TV cop with a bull horn ,  made many of the lyrics unintelligible ,  removing the thrust of his carefully - penned portraits of despair .

IT SEEMS that even in its own time the thirteenth - century motet was considered by many to be a sophisticated ,  subtle genre ,  only likely to appeal to the literati .  That these generally complex ,  polytextual pieces can today appeal to an almost capacity house at the Wigmore Hall is largely due to two factors :  the superb singing of Gothic Voices ,  and the ability of their director ,  Christopher Page ,  to unlock the musical secrets of the past .  Over the years , Page has established himself as a medieval raconteur , delighting his audience with tales of , say , thirteenth - century Paris ; but anecdotes aside , he has also been refining the presentation and programming so that , almost without realising it , his <head>audiences</head> learn a good deal about the often totally unfamiliar music being performed . This concert ,  part of the Early Music Centre Festival ,  was one of the most overtly educative so far ,  with even ,  at one point ,  an illustrated guide to composing a motet in five easy stages .  Yet there is nothing condescendingly didactic in Page 's  manner ,  nor anything textbookish about Gothic Voices '  performance .

No boxing match seems too trivial for live coverage ,  basketball and volleyball draw vast audiences ,  Formula One racing grips the nation and there is an inexhaustible appetite for football ,  to the extent that Saturday night English soccer is a major viewing habit .  Thus battle has been joined between RAI and the private channels for an <head>audience</head> which Italian advertisers regard as pre - eminently desirable .

Finvest 's  men have been making the bidding against RAI harder and harder by the season and now they are fighting on a match - by - match basis .  RAI protests that this amounts to a colossal waste of money since it previously acquired Eurovision rights for nothing more than the duty of reciprocal access to material from Italy .  But the pickings could be huge : the <head>audience</head> for RAI 's recorded Italian Sunday football in the United States and Canada may be as high as 50 million , while down in Latin America they hunger for footage of Maradona at almost any price .

The Director - General ,  Biagio Agnes  ( like all RAI executives a political party appointee )  ,  has angrily accused the Berlusconi camp of dragging in even the authorities of the state and seizing every opportunity to attack the public broadcasting service with statements of such arrogance that they betray weakness and sheer lack of class despite  ( Berlusconi 's  )  economic power and much - vaunted influential friendships .

I 'm not just a monkey dancing to the organ - grinder 's  tune .

The result of this hunger could simply be that opera houses survive the dog days of Thatcherism with full houses for Carmen etc. ,  or it could be the creation of new works that express and mirror the social and political needs of our culture in opera 's  emotive language .  But are there composers ready to seize this chance ?  Many composers now crave the chance to write operas , but will they acknowledge the duty to communicate with the <head>audience</head> ? There has always been a sense in which music is a secret ,  arcane ,  almost Cabbalistic ,  art .  But this introspective isolation ,  now compounded in so many cases by the fact that universities are the only institutions able to support a composer 's  existence ,  perpetuates the sense that the only right path for a serious composer is the romantic path of high seriousness and absolute individual integrity .

They cannot expect to affect the development of a genius like Janacek .  But that realisation should not be a disappointment :  rather it liberates us from the job of creating masterpieces ,  and gives us a much more achievable task .  That is quite simply to reduce by say 25 per cent the amount of time the eager opera <head>audience</head> wishes to spend listening to famous old works about famous old people and places , and instead increase the amount of time it wishes to spend listening to new works about ordinary people now . This is an exercise in persuasion ,  and requires composers who will focus their art on the simple and fundamental act of communication with their enthusiastic but tired ,  inattentive ,  restless ,  distracted and easily bored fellow human beings who none the less long to hear themselves in a not necessarily flattering mirror of music .  Our society needs to be given the chance to hear its own heartbeat in its own music  for pleasure first ,  then also for knowledge and understanding .

MUSIC / Unholy row :  CBSO / Rattle  Birmingham By JAN SMACZNY THE MOST appealing moment in Mark - Anthony Turnage 's engagingly chatty introduction to Three Screaming Popes , his Feeney commission premiere for the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra at the Birmingham Town Hall , came with a stated desire that his music should be accessible to an <head>audience</head> . Well ,  the Popes ,  in terrifying orchestral sonorities ,  certainly screamed and the new composition was ,  indeed ,  accessible to the audience .  This substantial ,  15 - minute orchestral movement was inspired by three paintings of Innocent X by Francis Bacon ,  themselves based on Velasquez .

According to these sources ,  the Pope and the Secretariat of State intend to push for a firm public commitment to legalisation by Mr Gorbachev when he visits Italy and the Vatican at the end of November .  They say the decision to step up overt pressure came quickly after the Vatican learned from Italian Foreign Ministry officials that Mr Gorbachev 's  visit was being curtailed to less than three full days. On Thursday , the Pope spoke forcibly to an <head>audience</head> of Ukrainian Catholic bishops , recalling that the native branch of their church had been driven into the catacombs , suffering the martyrdom of her bishops and priests , deportations , arrests and the closures of churches and monasteries . The cries of these Catholics reach Rome with ever - increasing urgency ,  he said .  The campaign of hostility and accusations against this church and her priests does not help reforms ,  but hinders them .

It was a mark of her artistic intelligence and independence that she did not choose to dish up a pot - pourri of well tried favourites for the occasion ,  drawing attention to herself rather than the music .  True ,  in a first half devoted to the song repertory she allowed herself a Wolf group which included Mein Liebster ist so Klein and Ich hab ' in Penna. But she effortlessly avoided that exasperating coyness with which some seek to engage their <head>audience</head> , and the group also included the angelic Wir haben beide lange Zeit with whose chiming repetitions she wove an enchanting spell . To frame this more familiar fare ,  she presented songs by Enesco and Marx ,  bringing to them the skill of a dramatic singer without ever overstepping the bounds of intimate communion required by the genre .  Enesco is a major force in twentieth century music whose almost total neglect at present is quite astonishing ,  and if his little Poemes de Clement Marot show a limited aspect of his art ,  they still breathed an engaging wit and charm in Miss Cotrubas 's  heart - warming performance .

All the signs are that radio is an exciting prospect  the forthcoming deregulation of the industry with associated changes in costs ,  and an expected boom in advertising revenues ,  is finally making the City take notice .  The potential for an advertising bonanza has come under the spotlight with the advent of splitting frequencies such as that undertaken by London 's  LBC last week .  Splitting frequencies transmitting different programmes on FM and AM could effectively double listening hours and provides two highly targeted <head>audiences</head> for advertising in a catchment area . In LBC 's  case ,  for example ,  the LBC Crown FM is going for the upmarket listener ,  while the medium wave service ,  London Talkback Radio ,  is pitching for the tabloid market and the dedicated followers of phone - ins .  Capital Radio ,  the other UK giant of the independents ,  has already split its frequencies ,  and before long all nine quoted independent stations are expected do so ,  albeit not always around the clock .

Being Labour 's  money man is never easy ,  even when the party is still in opposition and you are as persuasive as Mr Smith .  But for once ,  the regular Labour conference task of reminding the party the public purse is not bottomless was put in the shade by the two looming Tory conference tasks of presenting the poll tax  and 15 per cent base rates .  The first of these is basically more difficult ; but Mr Patten has the advantage of novelty , the sheen of possible succession to Mrs Thatcher , a way with green words and blue <head>audiences</head> .

There are times when this universe seems excessively ,  even arbitrarily ,  bleak .  Like Peter Brook 's  Endgame - inspired King Lear in the Sixties ,  this Macbeth takes the risk of narrowing the play 's  potential dramatic range in order to create a particular emphasis .  Limited scope exists for actors to develop individual characters : there is little room , in particular , to explore tensions between the sympathy and horror that Macbeth 's conflicts can elicit in an <head>audience</head> . Any loss in emotional or dramatic range ,  however ,  is generally compensated for by the fearsome intensity of the vision that results ,  and the compelling stylishness with which it is communicated .  Moving ,  like the witches ,  with confident ,  implacable force ,  the Citizens '  creates a Macbeth machine to assault a Scottish audience 's  expectations of this most familiar of Shakespeare 's  plays ,  leaving it ,  by the end ,  thoroughly drained and disturbed .

THIS YEAR'S enthusiastically Francophile Dance Umbrella opened with one of the most prestigious of the French new - wave companies  Jean - Claude Gallotta 's  Groupe Emile Dubois .  Gallotta 's  whimsical approach receives heavy support in his own country .  But on Monday night the <head>audience</head> at the Queen Elizabeth Hall appeared neatly divided between those who were willing to prolong the applause indefinitely and those who either disappeared discreetly halfway through or scarpered quickly at the end . Gallotta 's  Mammame is true to a very French type ,  with its scatty logic ,  its mix of dance ,  gesture and slapstick and its ability to polarise opinion between joyously unconfined choreography and mildly diverting tosh .  By the end of 90 minutes I was close to the tosh school ,  but still buoyed up by the work 's  genuine pleasures ;  the unflagging force of its energy ,  the wit of its timing and the comic unlikeliness of some of its performers .

By MARY FAGAN ,  Technology Correspondent BRITISH Pathe News Library ,  the film newsreel archive which chronicled world events of the last 100 years ,  has been acquired for 16m by Parkfield Group ,  the mini conglomerate .  Pathe , epitomised by its crowing cockerel and mildly patronising commentaries , stopped producing newsreels in 1970 after 75 years ' coverage of world events because of the decline of the film industry and a change in cinema <head>audience</head> tastes . But the library occupies an important position in British cinema history and includes unrivalled coverage of events ,  spanning Queen Victoria 's  diamond jubilee ,  the Wright brothers '  flight ,  the world wars and the onset of the space age .  Its footage is mainly licensed world - wide to film makers for inclusion in features and documentaries .

The present system ,  involving solicitors who put the interests of their clients first ,  was being replaced by a free market which will be a free - for - all among a handful of powerful ,  profit - motivated instititutions serving the financial interests of their shareholders .  Alan Johnston QC ,  treasurer of the 250 - strong Faculty of Advocates ,  said :  The disappearance of many small legal firms which rely on conveyancing income to underwrite the provision of other ,  non - profitable legal services will not be in the public interest .  The faculty also opposed the move to extend the rights of <head>audience</head> to suitably qualified solicitors , not to protect a monopoly , but because it felt the administration of justice might suffer . However ,  Mr Johnston was delighted by the Government 's  decision on lawyers '  partnerships ,  a view not shared by the Law Society of Scotland .  The Government plans to remove the statutory barrier to the formation of partnerships between solicitors and non - solicitors .

The society fears that the Bar and judges will exert subtle pressure to build in case separation requirements .

It did not set out to be radically different ,  though Haydn 's  colourful scoring was certainly enhanced by the use of period instruments  ( including a fortepiano in the recitatives and a bass line reinforced more consistently by bass trombone and contra bassoon )  ,  but it succeeded in being unforced and unfettered .  He made the most of his superb wind section ,  used the extra clarity of the strings to underline the richness of the harmony ,  and encouraged the brass to cut through the texture and pin down the rhythm as ,  for example ,  in the exhilarating chorus Achieved is the Glorious Work .  The <head>audiences</head> at the first performances of The Creation in Vienna in the late 1790s were entranced by Haydn 's musical depictions of every living creature from the mighty eagle to the lowly worm .

In the middle of the spectrum ,  however ,  are perceptions with more than a hint of approval or disapproval implicit in them :  perceptions of each party 's  electoral chances ;  perceptions of whether national economic performance and prospects are improving or declining ;  and images of the parties and party leaders .  It is not at all obvious whether viewing party leaders as energetic or decisive is a perception or an attitude .  To a foreign correspondent covering the British election for a foreign <head>audience</head> , whether a party leader appears energetic or decisive is simply a matter of objective reporting : a perception . To British voters ,  especially those who identify strongly with a political party ,   energetic or decisive probably imply approval :  for them ,  images are at the margin between perceptions and attitudes .  Media influence on perceptions is likely to depend upon whether they are at the pure perception end of the spectrum or at the margin between perceptions and attitudes .

It would give the viewer freedom of choice ,  even if that freedom was not extended to the broadcasters .  It might require public subsidies to political parties to finance their own newspapers and television stations .  Alternatively , rival parties could be given control of different public television stations : so BBC 1 and Channel 4 might become conservative - right wing channels while BBC 2 and ITV become socialist - left wing channels , which could then compete for an <head>audience</head> . The situation in some European countries approximates that model .

It was thought that anyone subscribing to a newspaper would have to pay a special tax .

In short ,  quite apart from economic or foreign policy considerations ,  the social momentum which had sustained the British throughout their difficult experiences since 1945 was not being maintained .  Underlying these themes was the belief that the problems of the British system were being thrown into stark relief by the endless economic difficulties of the 1970s .  The Oxford economists , Bacon and Eltis , found a receptive <head>audience</head> across the political spectrum for their diagnosis that Britain was generating far too few producers of wealth . In their stead came a new intermediate breed of service operatives working in administration ,  in finance ,  or in the professions .  University graduates became accountants ,  solicitors ,  or stock - brokers instead of entering industry .

Ramsey 's  weight in debates rested upon more than his manner and his fluency and his command of words .  He could be vehement in  denunciation .  On occasion marvellous phrases sprang out of his mouth and enthralled the <head>audience</head> . On off days he could sound tired ,  and sometimes excitement carried him away to an excess of length .  He was not the cleverest speaker in the house ,  a palm which by general consent went to the very Tory Charles Smyth ,  and the house also contained Patrick Devlin and Selwyn Lloyd and sometimes Rab Butler .

He did not write an autobiography , but his letters have been a source of fascination to a wide <head>audience</head> , especially artists . Luckily ,  he had a correspondent in his brother Theo in whom he could confide and with whom he could explore ideas about art ;  the letters are thus an invaluable source of interpretation .  From the distance of a century ,  some of Van Gogh 's  enthusiastic appraisals of the art of his time look curious ;  but then ,  this artist acting as a critic was especially vulnerable to admiring art with a moral purpose ,  or work from which he was able to draw inspiration .

The variations and exceptions to these brief generalised statements can be found in a number of books ,  some by investigative outsiders ,  some in memoirs by dealers and others interested in the market .  For other periods ,  historians are slowly making studies which document the connections of critics and historians with the markets .  In 1959 Dore Ashton was dismissed by the New York Times , the charges being that her articles were not aimed at a wide newspaper <head>audience</head> , and her articles on work by artist friends gave evidence of bias ( her husband , whose work she was forbidden to review , was a painter and print - maker called Adja Yunkers ) . John Canaday ,  the incoming editor of the newspaper 's  art page and responsible for the dismissal ,  had made a challenge to a climate of opinion in which Dore Ashton 's  criticism was valued for its sensitivity ,  and where the art which she praised was accepted .  Her supporters included Thomas Hess ,  Meyer Schapiro ,  Leo Steinberg ,  Harold Rosenberg ,  and Peter Selz ,  and their intervention ,  asserting that Canaday had offended Ashton 's  rights and responsibilities as a critic ,  resulted in Canaday 's  being censured by the American art critics '  association .

Some people find this makes theatre less believable  less true to their own experience and therefore less convincing than the more restrained performances seen on television and cinema .  Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the <head>audience</head> are vitally connected to what is going on . As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself ,  and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for .  Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters  this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre  ( for example ,  look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 ,  scene 1 of Henry V  ,  which draws the audience into the atmosphere before a battle enormously effectively )  .

Students may find themselves performing in final productions over two full terms ,  which means they have the opportunity to play twice as many parts ,  but this depends on the school 's  policy and how they think you have progressed .  At this stage ,  too ,  the allocation of parts and the standard of performance is becoming a lot more competitive  a foretaste of the profession itself .  In many cases students will also tour in productions mounted by the school , and this gives good <head>audience</head> experience away from the greenhouse of school performances , where the people who sit in the audience are usually either professionally interested , or are fellow students and friends . Any programme of final drama school productions will present a variety of styles and the casting is aimed at giving students a chance to do well in suitable roles .  Naturally ,  with a cast of actors who are all approximately the same age ,  the casting of heavy character parts has to be considered very carefully ,  and of course not all plays are teeming with characters of similar age .

They make deceptively subtle demands on their <head>audience</head> , and through all of them there runs a strong sense of humour . Her last film RATTLE OF A SIMPLE MAN  ( 1964 )  whose commercial and critical failure ended her career ,  can be seen as a woman 's  reply to the eulogies of the working class male celebrated by John Osbourne and his like ,  and it does so by poking fun at the ideology of the male and his crude sexism .  Ironically ,  this film stands up better today than many of its male social realist counterparts .

As terrestrial and satellite companies compete for sport and movies ,  the two major commodities which could ensure the future success of television ,  the conference will consider how the contest for the SPOILS OF SPORT will progress over the next decade .  How far will terrestrial broadcasters compete for the rights to SPORTS coverage ?  How will BBC and ITV survive and how much will they need to bid against each other to acquire the major sports which <head>audiences</head> will wish to see ? Will the vast sums of money which are being asked for by the Governing Bodies of Sport mean that they will price themselves out of the market or will television continue to pay as they compete for audiences ?  Sports and sporting figures are managed and packaged for television production and there is a fear amongst purists and some sporting fans that the spirit of sport will be lost in its relationship with television .

As raising development finance for fiction projects is the most difficult stage of production for independent producers and writers ,  the European Script Fund provides seed money to European producers and writers in an attempt to redress the imbalance between indigenous production and the great amount of imported fictional material in European cinemas and television .  The Script Fund is committed to the notion that without encouraging indigenous European stories of interest for its own <head>audiences</head> , our screens will continue to be overwhelmed by imported products and our national audio - visual industries will suffer . The grand total of awards made since the European Script Fund opened its doors in April 1989 has been 236 from over 2200 submissions received .  A total of 3 million has now been allocated to European applicants .

Although the scores of The Sleeping Beauty  and The  Nutcracker  followed Petipa 's  explicit orders that each item consisted of so many bars of one tempo and time signature and as to what it was supposed to represent ,  Tchaikovsky did demonstrate how ballet music could be developed symphonically by using the leitmotifs .

Stravinsky composed the first truly modern score for ballet with The Firebird   ( see page 61 )  .

Massine not only paralleled the overall and short phrase rhythms of the music by those of the dancers ,  but the instruments of the orchestra by related groups of dancers .

For example ,  when the musical phrases get complicated because of the use of many notes ,  the dancers find themselves using their hands feverishly in order to give every note its value .  Occasionally this can be interesting as it is in Bintley 's  Consort Lessons   ( 1984 )  .  But if it is repeated too often the incessant jigging of hands makes the <head>audience</head> restless , too . A study of Dalcroze Eurythmics from which such ideas emanate is valuable ,  but the practice must be used with discretion if the resultant ballet is not to resemble an examination of machinery rather than a feeling fur the rhythm and shape of the engine that makes the dancers perform .

Instead of concentrating on the lines of the dance  which they will need if they ever dance in Ashton 's  Symphonic Variations  or Monotones  ,  MacMillan 's  Requiem  or Bintley 's  Consort Lessons   students spend more time loosening up to meet the demands of modern choreographers .

Most other story ballets can be analysed in much the same way .  Those with a theme ,  or which consist of dance only ,  have a similar plan .  A choreographer who neglects the old rules and any item pertinent to the unfolding of the plot , theme or music is demanding a great deal from an <head>audience</head> . Many plotless or so - called abstract ballets ,  by choreographers such as Balanchine ,  have no specific characters or climaxes but they do follow the composer 's  score very closely .

This can be effected by the use of a leitmotif or phrases of music .  Since the first performance of Giselle  ,  certain composers and arrangers have used leitmotifs fur one or several characters and repeat the leitmotifs each time the characters appear .  These musical phrases give continuity to the action and are most valuable because they help both performers and <head>audience</head> to understand how moments in the story or theme affect the players . Adolphe Adam ,  composer of the music for Giselle  ,  initiated this idea which greatly influenced Wagner and later composers .  Leitmotifs are a firm point of reference that carries the dancer onwards from the     beginning to the climax and to the end of the story .

Choreographers can also take a more subjective view of their work .  This is equally important and has so proved throughout ballet history .

No better example can be given than by citing the careers of Tamara Karsavina and Margot Fonteyn ,  both of whom worked with many different choreographers as well as submitting themselves to the severely classical discipline of the older Petipa repertoire .  A general view  There is a third type of choreographer who produces ballets which give <head>audiences</head> great pleasure through the sheer variety of their virtuoso designs . Because of the interesting ,  usually technical ,  demands made on the performers ,  their ballets often become testing grounds for future soloists .  Variations from such ballets as Petipa 's  Don Quixote ,  Raymonda  and La Bayadre  and Bournonville 's  Napoli  are still considered by most classical dancers to be more technically demanding than the more complex twistings and turnings of modern choreographers who mix their styles .

Measurable extent of any kind ;  number of unknown qualities contained as factors in a whole Dimension immediately suggests that the choreographer must take into account the space in which the dancers move .  Although this is of considerable importance , particularly if the ballet is to be presented in a large theatre , too much concentration on certain of the dimensions ( height , depth or breadth ) may deprive some members of the <head>audience</head> of much of the pattern . for example ,  too much weaving and rolling of bodies on the floor is hardly visible from the stalls ,  whilst too much concentration on one side of the stage finds spectators on the same side craning their necks to see what is going on .  It was for such reason that most of Petipa 's  famous pas de deux  take place centre stage ,  whilst those of Ashton and MacMillan cover the whole area as befits their more flowing lyrical styles ,

Once an outline of the story and a general layout of the plot have been decided ,  they should be discussed with the composer or arranger of music whose first task may be to create a proper beginning with the overture .  Is it to set the general atmosphere and mood as Stravinsky did for The Firebird  Mysterious sounds of the wind whispering in the trees ,  the soaring flight of a bird and the heavy tread of an unseen foot are still a wonderful introduction to this magic tale .  On the other hand , Prokofiev used his overture to Romeo and Juliet to introduce the leitmotifs which will help both dancers and <head>audience</head> to follow the unfolding of the plot . He contrasts the love themes of Romeo and Juliet with those which accompany the bitter struggles and fights between Montague and Capulet .

Despite the general activities there is menace in the air and it is not long before the rival factions of Montagues and Capulets are fighting and deaths occurring before the lovers even meet .  This opening is very different from the quietly charming first scene of A Month in the Country  ,  where the only thing amiss is Natalia 's  bored behaviour .  Even with such examples in mind the choreographer may well decide it is better to delay the confrontation between the chief players because , by creating and stressing the general atmosphere , this raises the <head>audience</head> 's expectations before the meeting of the protagonists , and the sudden onset of passion is what makes the ultimate tragedy so poignant . This happens in Giselle  where Hilarion 's  suspicions of Albrecht 's  identity are already aroused before Albrecht meets Giselle .  Hilarion 's  discovery of Albrecht 's  sword and later his confrontation with Giselle ,  with the sword in his hands ,  still does not convince Giselle of Albrecht 's  duplicity .

Despite the great differences in style between the above three ballets and despite their different libretti the three choreographers perrot  ( with Saint - Georges )  ,  MacMillan and Ashton give valid reasons why the tragic deaths of Giselle ,  Romeo and Juliet ,  and Natalia 's  lost love are the inevitable result of what has gone before .  In other words ,  what happens at the beginning of the story states why the relationships between two or more characters lead to confrontations which continue onwards to a climax and finally draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion .  This last task is possibly the most difficult because the <head>audience</head> must be convinced that the ending chosen is the only possible outcome of everything that has gone before . The ending can also owe a great deal to the composer or arranger of music .

The style must disclose and be expressive of the moods ,  emotions and actions of the roles played even where few personal feelings are allowed to show ,  as in such ballets as Ashton 's  Monotones  where all that is needed is a calm ,  unhurried and seemingly endless weaving of the dance design in all its dimensions .

A contradiction in style during this change of aulement  or alignment can distort the design .  Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement  or alignment can add interest and draw attention to a dancer 's  statement .  for example : the swift change from the grand dvelopp la seconde which Odile makes facing the <head>audience</head> and her sudden turn to arabesque when she looks straight into the kneeling Siegfried 's eyes in the Act II pas de deux of Swan Lake ; it is Odile 's triumph for she knows she has won Siegfried 's heart . Even more exciting changes of aulement  can be found in Ashton 's  Birthday  Offering  where each soloist dances an old step at a new angle ,  without breaking the rules or older conventions of nineteenth - century ballet .  He then gives an entirely new quality to the class - room exercise on which these enchanements  are based.

Birthday Offering  Ashton 's  technical virtuosity  ( The Royal Ballet )  Choreographers who do not adhere strictly to the old conventions of court etiquette realise that their total design will flow more easily because their dancers '  behaviour will appear more spontaneous and natural .  For example : each soloist need not begin with a formal bow to a king or to the <head>audience</head> , nor end with another bow or considered pose ; but such behaviour may be included if the choreographer wishes to locate dance in a particular century and probably a palace in which the story unfolds . Many new members of an audience have been known to object to the applause greeting the last bow .  It breaks the continuity of the dance .

This last convention is invaluable in early training because it helps to stabilise balance during the transfer from one foot to the other and is also valuable in such ballets as Birthday Offering  as it echoes the period and style of Glazounov 's  music .  But this would get very boring if used too often .  Another old rule decreed that dancers never turned their backs on the <head>audience</head> , because all had to face the king , the centre of attention . The turn of a dancer 's  back can now become part of a beautiful line being made in a total picture .  Today 's  dancers not only dance fur an audience .

A sudden change of aulement  ,  an unusual turn in - out of legs or arms ,  or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design .  Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton 's  five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros  and Consort Lessons  .  In fact such unusual movements often arouse the <head>audience</head> to gentle laughter as swift changes add a touch of humour as two or more dancers compete to capture the attention of both the audience and their Colleagues . Classical dance patterns In classical ballet the patterns and groupings delineated by the dancers '  bodies are usually symmetrical and evenly balanced over the whole stage .

It should be noted that a similar order of precedence exists in Ashton 's  Scnes de Ballet  as in Petipa 's  The Sleeping Beauty  which was supposed to be an evocation of a court ballet at the time of Louis XIV .  However ,  when ballets were performed for the public ,  professional dancers took the place of courtiers and technical innovations had to be made .  The dancers now appeared on a stage before a wide <head>audience</head> and the focus of their attention changed to the whole audience or to the most important performers . They had to adapt their movements to cover a larger space which was like a box with one side only being open to public gaze .  They had to pay greater attention to the placing of each step and pose within the new framework .

Those in the <head>audience</head> who have had to suffer such behaviour in a concert hall , whilst trying to listen to a brilliant musician , know that his remarks about certain characters are only too true . Whatever occupational gesture  ( mime )  a choreographer chooses to use in ballet ,  it must be envisaged in terms of dance without the use of props .

composers ,  authors ,  poets and painters ,  began to strengthen the national features of their work .

When this happened , however , even the traditional features became more stereotyped because choreographers used only those which the <head>audience</head> could easily recognise and which were commonly seen and heard in a particular country . It was from such traditional dance that Fokine ,  at the instigation of Diaghilev ,  devised the first truly national ballets by breaking away from the sterotyped steps .  Instead ,  Fokine based his design  ( as did the composer Stravinsky and the artist Korovin  ( later Goncharova )  )  on the folk tales ,  customs ,  traditional dances and music of Russia without in any way conforming to the generally accepted rules of classical technique .

His dance throughout has its base in the classical vocabulary but MacMillan has coloured it by gestures from cabaret and vaudeville dance traditions ,  which serve to reveal not only class  differences in behaviour but also genuine feelings .  This is why Bratfisch is so important .  Without him there is no other character with whom the <head>audience</head> can feel sympathy . Ashton 's  Alain shows yet another aspect of the sad clown or little man and can ,  when subtly played ,  gain much sympathy because ,  while things seem to go right ,  he is so pleased with life .

MacMillan 's  The Burrow  ,  based on the real diary of Anne Frank ,  was possibly the most explicit and moving of all his efforts to depict reality in terms of dance  ( see page 30 )  .

The narrative maximizes  Stepan 's  vulnerability ,  perching him on a platform amid the malcontents and troublemakers and the much larger number of those humble ,  obscure people who are enduring more or less passively the chaos of the fte .  He is holding forth about beauty to an <head>audience</head> which has been short - changed over food and drink and entertainment . Therefore he is asking for trouble ,  and he receives it suddenly and in full measure ,  above the groundswell of heckling ,  at the hands of a divinity student who reminds him at the top of his voice about Fedka ,  a dangerous escaped convict now roaming our town and originally a serf of Stepan 's  whom he sold into military service to pay a gambling debt :  If you had not lost him at cards ,  would he have got into prison ?

Nuttall has elsewhere given a mischievous account of an academic occasion in which a speaker insisted on asserting ,  It is a truth that the workers are oppressed .  This ,  Nuttall remarks ,  acted as a red rag .  It was as if the logical conservatism ' of his remark was more significant and more offensive to his ( predominantly left - wing ) <head>audience</head> than its thoroughly socialist content . In A New Mimesis  Nuttall accused Hawkes of collective cultural solipsism .  Hawkes ,  in turn ,  gave the book a mockingly dismissive review in the TLS  ,  without mentioning Nuttall 's  accusation against him.

She writes :  And if the reading public as a whole is shrinking ,  if literature is increasingly relegated to the schools as something to be studied  if ,  in a word ,  the majority of readers now are scholars  ( whether students or professional academics )   then the claims of literary theory to be our representative literary genre become stronger still .  What better inspiration could a literature of theory have than an <head>audience</head> composed of theorists and critics ? This is not ,  I think ,  meant to be ironical ,  and it represents a quite logical development from the premiss that the whole production ,  definition ,  and reception of literature has now become intramural to the academy .  In this context ,  what goes on outside ,  what is actually written by poets and novelists ,  is of minor interest .

The plot ,  insofar as one could discern it ,  was both labyrinthine and self - cancellingly ambiguous ,  built round an interview in a psychiatric hospital between a journalist and the grief - obsessed widow of a German professor who had bequeathed a videotape casting doubt on the official version of Hess 's  death .

The script cut from psychiatry to politics to history to Euro - moralising with dizzy speed ;  film - clip collages of Hitler saluting ,  Hess  ( or not - Hess )  in the mortuary ,  hamburger ads ,  crumbling buildings ,  a screaming man in seventeenth - century dress ,  and the widow miming Hess 's  improbable suicide all chimed in an unholy jangle with the events on stage .  The questions raised may have been interesting ,  but the answers given were tritely familiar ;  the authorial tone was relentlessly baleful .

If Mr Lawson can hold off a base rate rise at least until he can blame the Germans ,  that will make his political task a fraction easier ;  but not much .

In these cases the interests of justice may demand special requirements such as ,  for example ,  that the preparation and presentation of the case be in separate and independent hands .  In the second category ,  general civil cases ,  parties should be able to choose their own lawyers because the interests of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's  right of choice .  Lord Donaldson implied , however , that solicitors who exercised their new rights of <head>audience</head> in these cases ought to be expected to concentrate on advocacy . While emphasising that he had not reached any firm conclusions ,  Lord Donaldson 's  voice will be a powerful one in behind - the - scenes manoeuvres as rules governing the exercise of the new advocacy rights are hammered out away from the parliamentary battlefield .  The rules will be drawn up by the Law Society having regard to suggestions made by a new lay - dominated independent advisory committee on legal education and conduct .

But on the other hand ,  the statute will also include a clear intention that extended rights of audience are put into practical effect as soon as the necessary conditions have been met .  A majority of judges said in their response to the Green Papers that standards of conduct and competence might decline if lawyers who worked in partnerships and took instructions directly from clients  ( most solicitors )  were allowed widespread access to the higher courts .  Lord Donaldson 's formula for settling the rights of <head>audience</head> controversy was viewed as an adept political move by some delegates . Alternative dividing lines which have been informally mooted ,  such as simply restricting solicitor - advocates in Crown Court jury trials to the less serious cases ,  had been viewed as difficult to support as a matter of principle .  Lord Donaldson 's  remarks were greeted with cautious enthusiasm by Bar leaders .

But there is not much Pinter ,  and definitely no Beckett ,  about this solid piece of middle - class music theatre by the Canadian composer Quenten Doolittle ,  which began its short British tour by the Banff Music Theatre at the Chapter Arts Centre ,  Cardiff .  Doolittle has based himself on what seems a pellucidly consequential and intelligently written play by Rex Deverell ( also the librettist ) ; and though the piece is offered as best suited to alternative <head>audiences</head> , it cuts an oddly respectable figure in the modestly louche surroundings of Chapter . Two reasons strike me for this .  First ,  the work is dramaturgically polite ;  it consults its audience too much to be taken seriously as drop - out theatre .

Piecemeal highlights are all very well ,  but viewers tend to be creatures of habit and ,  at present ,  a short burst of goals every Saturday night is just a tease ;  an uninitiated visitor would never guess that football was the national game .  Within ITV 's  ranks ,  there is concern that last season 's  gains have been wasted .

Before a demoralising defeat when challenging Mike Tyson for the world heavyweight championship two years ago Biggs would have probably been too dangerous a proposition for Mason but something has gone from him since then and he was unable to fulfil bold pre - fight assertions .  Both men took heavy blows and by withstanding the best of the American 's  punches Mason at least emphasised that he has a strong enough chin .  It was not a contest to excite the <head>audience</head> and there must have been some anxiety in Mason 's corner as it approached a critical stage . Mason was ahead but Biggs for a while looked the stronger man and employed his superior technique to suggest that Mason might be running into trouble .  He took four of six rounds and yet without ever making his supporters believe that a decisive victory was on the cards .

Out Of The Blue was fractured in the extreme ,  Heartland became a loose - limbed skank ,  and Marr more than proved his worth on Violence of Truth .  Good as the concert was ,  it was rather too middle of the road for a tour titled The The vs The World and ,  sadly for fans of the more paranoid earlier work ,  Johnson 's  attempts to darken the proceedings ended up looking silly .  By not uttering a word to the <head>audience</head> , then keeping the stage shrouded in smoke , lit only from the back in lurid purple , orange and red , and reducing the band to shadowy figures looming out of a fog , he put so much distance between them and anybody past the regulation front - of - stage pogoers that attention easily wandered . And the over - use of an extra microphone ,  giving his voice the qualities of a US TV cop with a bull horn ,  made many of the lyrics unintelligible ,  removing the thrust of his carefully - penned portraits of despair .  Under the weight of such cliches ,  The The were about as dangerous as the average heavy metal band .

IT SEEMS that even in its own time the thirteenth - century motet was considered by many to be a sophisticated ,  subtle genre ,  only likely to appeal to the literati .  That these generally complex ,  polytextual pieces can today appeal to an almost capacity house at the Wigmore Hall is largely due to two factors :  the superb singing of Gothic Voices ,  and the ability of their director ,  Christopher Page ,  to unlock the musical secrets of the past .  Over the years , Page has established himself as a medieval raconteur , delighting his audience with tales of , say , thirteenth - century Paris ; but anecdotes aside , he has also been refining the presentation and programming so that , almost without realising it , his <head>audiences</head> learn a good deal about the often totally unfamiliar music being performed . This concert ,  part of the Early Music Centre Festival ,  was one of the most overtly educative so far ,  with even ,  at one point ,  an illustrated guide to composing a motet in five easy stages .  Yet there is nothing condescendingly didactic in Page 's  manner ,  nor anything textbookish about Gothic Voices '  performance .

The range of sports programmes ,  live and packaged ,  is extraordinary ,  while the videotape market is booming .  No boxing match seems too trivial for live coverage ,  basketball and volleyball draw vast audiences ,  Formula One racing grips the nation and there is an inexhaustible appetite for football ,  to the extent that Saturday night English soccer is a major viewing habit .  Thus battle has been joined between RAI and the private channels for an <head>audience</head> which Italian advertisers regard as pre - eminently desirable .

Finvest 's  men have been making the bidding against RAI harder and harder by the season and now they are fighting on a match - by - match basis .

The Director - General ,  Biagio Agnes  ( like all RAI executives a political party appointee )  ,  has angrily accused the Berlusconi camp of dragging in even the authorities of the state and seizing every opportunity to attack the public broadcasting service with statements of such arrogance that they betray weakness and sheer lack of class despite  ( Berlusconi 's  )  economic power and much - vaunted influential friendships .

The result of this hunger could simply be that opera houses survive the dog days of Thatcherism with full houses for Carmen etc. ,  or it could be the creation of new works that express and mirror the social and political needs of our culture in opera 's  emotive language .

There has always been a sense in which music is a secret ,  arcane ,  almost Cabbalistic ,  art .

They cannot expect to affect the development of a genius like Janacek .  But that realisation should not be a disappointment :  rather it liberates us from the job of creating masterpieces ,  and gives us a much more achievable task .  That is quite simply to reduce by say 25 per cent the amount of time the eager opera <head>audience</head> wishes to spend listening to famous old works about famous old people and places , and instead increase the amount of time it wishes to spend listening to new works about ordinary people now . This is an exercise in persuasion ,  and requires composers who will focus their art on the simple and fundamental act of communication with their enthusiastic but tired ,  inattentive ,  restless ,  distracted and easily bored fellow human beings who none the less long to hear themselves in a not necessarily flattering mirror of music .  Our society needs to be given the chance to hear its own heartbeat in its own music  for pleasure first ,  then also for knowledge and understanding .

According to these sources ,  the Pope and the Secretariat of State intend to push for a firm public commitment to legalisation by Mr Gorbachev when he visits Italy and the Vatican at the end of November .

On Thursday , the Pope spoke forcibly to an <head>audience</head> of Ukrainian Catholic bishops , recalling that the native branch of their church had been driven into the catacombs , suffering the martyrdom of her bishops and priests , deportations , arrests and the closures of churches and monasteries .

It was a mark of her artistic intelligence and independence that she did not choose to dish up a pot - pourri of well tried favourites for the occasion ,  drawing attention to herself rather than the music .  True ,  in a first half devoted to the song repertory she allowed herself a Wolf group which included Mein Liebster ist so Klein and Ich hab ' in Penna. But she effortlessly avoided that exasperating coyness with which some seek to engage their <head>audience</head> , and the group also included the angelic Wir haben beide lange Zeit with whose chiming repetitions she wove an enchanting spell . To frame this more familiar fare ,  she presented songs by Enesco and Marx ,  bringing to them the skill of a dramatic singer without ever overstepping the bounds of intimate communion required by the genre .  Enesco is a major force in twentieth century music whose almost total neglect at present is quite astonishing ,  and if his little Poemes de Clement Marot show a limited aspect of his art ,  they still breathed an engaging wit and charm in Miss Cotrubas 's  heart - warming performance .

All the signs are that radio is an exciting prospect  the forthcoming deregulation of the industry with associated changes in costs ,  and an expected boom in advertising revenues ,  is finally making the City take notice .

Splitting frequencies transmitting different programmes on FM and AM could effectively double listening hours and provides two highly targeted <head>audiences</head> for advertising in a catchment area . In LBC 's  case ,  for example ,  the LBC Crown FM is going for the upmarket listener ,  while the medium wave service ,  London Talkback Radio ,  is pitching for the tabloid market and the dedicated followers of phone - ins .  Capital Radio ,  the other UK giant of the independents ,  has already split its frequencies ,  and before long all nine quoted independent stations are expected do so ,  albeit not always around the clock .

Being Labour 's  money man is never easy ,  even when the party is still in opposition and you are as persuasive as Mr Smith .  But for once ,  the regular Labour conference task of reminding the party the public purse is not bottomless was put in the shade by the two looming Tory conference tasks of presenting the poll tax  and 15 per cent base rates .  The first of these is basically more difficult ; but Mr Patten has the advantage of novelty , the sheen of possible succession to Mrs Thatcher , a way with green words and blue <head>audiences</head> .

Pastor Albani urged his congregation to follow Christ 's  way of non - violence :  We must try not to be another lot of historical victors hold to God 's  word and love your neighbour as yourself .  The congregation  perhaps 400 people ,  from outrageous punks to young women with babies  prayed with him to free us from the temptation of power ,  the temptation of violence  remove us from the barriers of ideology .

RADIO / No laughing matter By ROBERT HANKS COMEDIANS are supposed to work better with an <head>audience</head> . Not always though :  witness the strange ,  sad case of Arnold Brown and Company  ( Radio 4 ,  Saturday )  ,  a series which slips neatly into the BBC tradition of vaguely funny cabaret .  Much of Arnold Brown 's  strength as a stand - up comedian lies in his eyebrows ,  a pair of fat black ,  hyperactive caterpillars .

The effect of this is ,  curiously for a man who claims to have been ejected from the Library Theatre in Manchester for being overdue with his punchlines ,  to slow things down. Brown is n't a man with a big punch ;  it 's  those telling body - blows that sap your opponent ,  plus some sly head - butts in the clinch .  Put him in the ring with an <head>audience</head> that you ca n't see , and he seems to be delivering butterfly - taps . The Law Game  ( Radio 2 ,  Tuesday )  also has an audience response problem ,  perhaps because the format is tired ;  after all ,  it is in its fourteenth series .  The way it works is this :  Shaw Taylor introduces three short scenes in which actors have rows ,  go to industrial tribunals ,  issue death threats and so forth .

The way it works is this :  Shaw Taylor introduces three short scenes in which actors have rows ,  go to industrial tribunals ,  issue death threats and so forth .  If necessary ,  Shaw then adds details  ( who sued whom )  ,  and a panel of celebrities is asked who won and why ,  or who got sent down and for how long .  The Law Game suffers uniquely by its <head>audience</head> : you know that they are there , because they applaud at the beginning . But after that ,  every joke belly - flops into silence .  Well ,  almost every joke :  when celebrity panellist Duggie Brown said backside ,  how they roared !

There are times when this universe seems excessively ,  even arbitrarily ,  bleak .  Like Peter Brook 's  Endgame - inspired King Lear in the Sixties ,  this Macbeth takes the risk of narrowing the play 's  potential dramatic range in order to create a particular emphasis .  Limited scope exists for actors to develop individual characters : there is little room , in particular , to explore tensions between the sympathy and horror that Macbeth 's conflicts can elicit in an <head>audience</head> . Any loss in emotional or dramatic range ,  however ,  is generally compensated for by the fearsome intensity of the vision that results ,  and the compelling stylishness with which it is communicated .  Moving ,  like the witches ,  with confident ,  implacable force ,  the Citizens '  creates a Macbeth machine to assault a Scottish audience 's  expectations of this most familiar of Shakespeare 's  plays ,  leaving it ,  by the end ,  thoroughly drained and disturbed .

THIS YEAR'S enthusiastically Francophile Dance Umbrella opened with one of the most prestigious of the French new - wave companies  Jean - Claude Gallotta 's  Groupe Emile Dubois .  Gallotta 's  whimsical approach receives heavy support in his own country .  But on Monday night the <head>audience</head> at the Queen Elizabeth Hall appeared neatly divided between those who were willing to prolong the applause indefinitely and those who either disappeared discreetly halfway through or scarpered quickly at the end . Gallotta 's  Mammame is true to a very French type ,  with its scatty logic ,  its mix of dance ,  gesture and slapstick and its ability to polarise opinion between joyously unconfined choreography and mildly diverting tosh .  By the end of 90 minutes I was close to the tosh school ,  but still buoyed up by the work 's  genuine pleasures ;  the unflagging force of its energy ,  the wit of its timing and the comic unlikeliness of some of its performers .

But the library occupies an important position in British cinema history and includes unrivalled coverage of events ,  spanning Queen Victoria 's  diamond jubilee ,  the Wright brothers '  flight ,  the world wars and the onset of the space age .

The present system ,  involving solicitors who put the interests of their clients first ,  was being replaced by a free market which will be a free - for - all among a handful of powerful ,  profit - motivated instititutions serving the financial interests of their shareholders .  Alan Johnston QC ,  treasurer of the 250 - strong Faculty of Advocates ,  said :  The disappearance of many small legal firms which rely on conveyancing income to underwrite the provision of other ,  non - profitable legal services will not be in the public interest .  The faculty also opposed the move to extend the rights of <head>audience</head> to suitably qualified solicitors , not to protect a monopoly , but because it felt the administration of justice might suffer . However ,  Mr Johnston was delighted by the Government 's  decision on lawyers '  partnerships ,  a view not shared by the Law Society of Scotland .  The Government plans to remove the statutory barrier to the formation of partnerships between solicitors and non - solicitors .

It did not set out to be radically different ,  though Haydn 's  colourful scoring was certainly enhanced by the use of period instruments  ( including a fortepiano in the recitatives and a bass line reinforced more consistently by bass trombone and contra bassoon )  ,  but it succeeded in being unforced and unfettered .  He made the most of his superb wind section ,  used the extra clarity of the strings to underline the richness of the harmony ,  and encouraged the brass to cut through the texture and pin down the rhythm as ,  for example ,  in the exhilarating chorus Achieved is the Glorious Work .  The <head>audiences</head> at the first performances of The Creation in Vienna in the late 1790s were entranced by Haydn 's musical depictions of every living creature from the mighty eagle to the lowly worm .

We need to distinguish between different media sources and also between the media 's  ability to inform and its ability to persuade .  Different elements of the media perform different functions .  From what we know about their <head>audience</head> and their content , we would expect major differences between the influence of television and the influence of the press , and major differences also between the influence of highbrow and lowbrow sources . If they have any influence at all ,  different media sources should influence their audiences in different ways .  THE EXPECTED INFLUENCE OF TELEVISION

Given those characteristics we should not expect BBC and ITV viewers to be influenced in different ways .  Whatever influence television news has on voters ,  it would be likely to affect all ,  or nearly all voters .  It would not affect different <head>audiences</head> in different ways . If we seek evidence of television 's  influence ,  we  should correlate general trends in public opinion with trends in the content of television news .  Moreover ,  despite its failings ,  British television is still very much an information medium rather than a propaganda medium .

In the middle of the spectrum ,  however ,  are perceptions with more than a hint of approval or disapproval implicit in them :  perceptions of each party 's  electoral chances ;  perceptions of whether national economic performance and prospects are improving or declining ;  and images of the parties and party leaders .  It is not at all obvious whether viewing party leaders as energetic or decisive is a perception or an attitude .  To a foreign correspondent covering the British election for a foreign <head>audience</head> , whether a party leader appears energetic or decisive is simply a matter of objective reporting : a perception . To British voters ,  especially those who identify strongly with a political party ,   energetic or decisive probably imply approval :  for them ,  images are at the margin between perceptions and attitudes .  Media influence on perceptions is likely to depend upon whether they are at the pure perception end of the spectrum or at the margin between perceptions and attitudes .

This chapter uses two techniques to investigate media influence .  To assess the impact of pervasive and consensual television news we can correlate trends in television news content and trends in overall public perceptions .  To assess the impact of more differentiated media sources we can look for differences between their different <head>audiences</head> : differences between readers of highbrow or lowbrow papers , for example , or between readers of right - wing and left - wing papers . THE IMPACT OF A CHANGING TELEVISION CONSENSUS Our analysis of television news content in Chapter 4 showed that controversy reached a peak on television in the third week of the campaign .

As  ( 11 )  for ITV news .  Note ,  however ,  that over three - quarters of those who watched ITV news at any time had also watched BBC - TV news on the same day ;  and over 90 per cent of those who watched ITV news regularly also watched BBC - TV news regularly .  Approximately , therefore , ITV news viewers were a subset of BBC - TV news viewers , not an alternative <head>audience</head> . Watching ITV news meant ,  in practice ,  watching more TV news .  It is a long list ,  but the SPSSX stepwise procedure seldom selected more than a few predictors as having a significant influence upon perceptions .

It would give the viewer freedom of choice ,  even if that freedom was not extended to the broadcasters .  It might require public subsidies to political parties to finance their own newspapers and television stations .  Alternatively , rival parties could be given control of different public television stations : so BBC 1 and Channel 4 might become conservative - right wing channels while BBC 2 and ITV become socialist - left wing channels , which could then compete for an <head>audience</head> . The situation in some European countries approximates that model .  In Britain the idea of openly partisan broadcasting was pioneered by the Scottish Nationalists '  clandestine and illegal Radio Free Scotland in the 1960s and more recently by Southern Sound ,  who used a discarded former commercial radio band to set up their entirely open and legal Conference Radio FM to cover the 1990 Conservative Party Conference from an unashamedly pro - Conservative viewpoint .

All they could imagine was that some  new sort of tax was to be imposed on them .  They were relieved to find that this was not just another Communist trick .  How was the common lot of this <head>audience</head> changing in 1922 ? The number of working hands had risen in the volost ' from 577 in 1917 to 872 now .  This was mainly due to demobilization ,  but others may have been attracted to the region due to the fact that through the expropriation of landowners ,  the area held by peasants had gone up by 65 per cent since 1917 .

For lack of sympathetic agents ,  the peasants were often left to their own devices in matters of general and even political culture .  Yakovlev observed that state publications for 1922 from Gosizdat and Krasnaia Nov ' included nothing on agricultural and rural affairs .  How could the undiluted works of Kautsky and Engels appeal to this <head>audience</head> at a time when even party members at lower levels rarely understood the meaning of such concrete words as official , categorical , Plenum , memorandum , or territory ? Only five peasants in the whole of Nikol 'skaia volost ' had read any political or agricultural texts .  The minds of the other literate villagers were dissipated on what they could pick up in a random manner :  most of it naturally consisted of religious tracts ,  the traditional fodder left over from the past .

It was thought that anyone subscribing to a newspaper would have to pay a special tax .  Among the wilder rumours in strong circulation were that Lenin was dead ,  that the French had chosen Nicholas as their Tsar ,  and that England had declared war on Russia ,  so there would be wholesale peasant mobilization once again .  The distribution speed of oral rumour was much quicker than that of newspapers , which from the guberniia capital of Voronezh ' Shafir calculated to be one verst for every four and a half hours.The chief stumbling block to a wider newspaper <head>audience</head> remained the high illiteracy rate . Shafir made a detailed study of comprehension levels by the supposedly literate .  A 27 - year - old party member and ex - Red Army man had read the press regularly since 1917 ,  but did not know the meaning of words such as class enemy ,  occupation ,  period ,  or most abbreviations ,  including the USSR .

In short ,  quite apart from economic or foreign policy considerations ,  the social momentum which had sustained the British throughout their difficult experiences since 1945 was not being maintained .  Underlying these themes was the belief that the problems of the British system were being thrown into stark relief by the endless economic difficulties of the 1970s .  The Oxford economists , Bacon and Eltis , found a receptive <head>audience</head> across the political spectrum for their diagnosis that Britain was generating far too few producers of wealth . In their stead came a new intermediate breed of service operatives working in administration ,  in finance ,  or in the professions .  University graduates became accountants ,  solicitors ,  or stock - brokers instead of entering industry .

Ramsey 's  weight in debates rested upon more than his manner and his fluency and his command of words .  He could be vehement in  denunciation .  On occasion marvellous phrases sprang out of his mouth and enthralled the <head>audience</head> . On off days he could sound tired ,  and sometimes excitement carried him away to an excess of length .  He was not the cleverest speaker in the house ,  a palm which by general consent went to the very Tory Charles Smyth ,  and the house also contained Patrick Devlin and Selwyn Lloyd and sometimes Rab Butler .

Undismayed , he haled an old man out of the <head>audience</head> , stuck him in the chair , and then spoke himself for an hour and answered all the questions . At another meeting in the open air he spoke from a cart and was tumbled when a member of the proletariat told the horse to Gee up. He wrote Michael Ramsey 's  Monthly Message for the Cambridgeshire Liberal Magazine ,  which thereafter was scattered among the villagers .

Ramsey spoke out about his faith for Liberalism and talked eloquently about the freedom of Liberal minds .  He could say sentences which would have been preposterous if they were seen as rhetoric but which he could carry because they were delivered with uproarious humour  Liberalism prolonged one 's  youth ,  Liberalism did not decay .  The speech , observed Benson , who thought it remarkable , was rapturously received by that huge <head>audience</head> . Asquith was moved .  He rose to give thanks for the thanks .

The contrast during the week of mission was so extraordinary as to affect Ramsey 's  life .

Temple talked rationally and effectively in Great St Mary 's and held his <head>audience</head> . Norwood ,  despite thoughtfulness and humour ,  slowly lost adherents to the other two speakers .  In Holy Trinity Church Nicholson abounded in anecdotes ,  vulgarity ,  rudeness ,  emotional appeals ,  a dogmatism so dogmatic as to frighten .

Frank did not conceal his regret .   Ramsey lost neither his sense of humour nor his power of mimicry when he became an ordinand .  For party occasions he delivered a skit sermon called Under the Juniper Tree which could reduce his <head>audiences</head> to helpless laughter by its caricature of the most platitudinous and pontificating type of preaching . Ramsey expected that once the resolution was taken everything in the mind would be peace after doubt .  He discovered that this did not happen .

Hoskyns ,  said one of the astringent colleagues who disapproved of him ,  went to Berlin and they muddled his mind and when he came back he could never get it unmuddled .  Hoskyns was not a good lecturer .  At least , he lectured in such a way that many in the <head>audience</head> found him impossible to understand . This was one of the reasons why Bethune - Baker ,  who thought that everything obscure was woolly ,  regarded him as useless if not bad for the young .  Students were known to spend their time in his lectures counting up the number of clichs which he used .
