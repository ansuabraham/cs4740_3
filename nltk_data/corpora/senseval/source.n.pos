The 1989 figures indicate a reversal of this trend with 276 death  setences  passed and a sharp reduction of commutations to 23 .

The same <head>source</head> reports that 190 executions took place last year . AI welcomes the publication of statistics on the death penalty ,  as well as current proposals to limit its scope .

The immense task of gathering ,  analysing and confirming allegations of human rights violations from around the world falls to the Research Department at the International Secretariat ,  Amnesty 's  headquarters in London .

When we hear of such cases , we investigate and draw on as many <head>sources</head> as possible to find out what happened In one sense it 's  very much like good investigative journalism ,  explains Malcolm Smart ,  Head of Research at the IS .  The information comes to the IS through myriad channels ,  some of them formal  over 1,100 newspapers ,  journals ,  government bulletins and transcripts of radio broadcasts are sifted  and others that are less predictable .

This comparison has fazed  her ,  as she only knows about Lee Krasner as the widow of Jackson Pollock ;  so the library visit is intended to check out reproductions of Lee Krasner 's  work ,  to see if she has to concede that her friend may be right .

Among the <head>sources</head> she will find are critical reviews , articles , catalogues and books about New York painting of the 1940s and 1950s , which will remind her that Pollock died in 1956 . There is no shortage of writing about Pollock ;  like other star artists ,  he has an embarrassingly large number of apologists ,  but fortunately there are select bibliographies which can guide her to key publications .  There may ,  however ,  be questions in her mind about the choices open to her :  how will the information in a catalogue differ from what is to be found in a monograph ?

There is no need to be intimidated by the formality of a staid institution 's  catalogue ,  or to neglect popular magazines ;  as for writing in various academic disciplines ,  there ought to be no barrier to learning about an interesting topic .

The properties of the material made limewood sculpture a special medium .  It was a medium of the grand form and of the surface ,  whether polychrome or monochrome ;  it was not a positive medium of the middle forms ,  like oak ,  or even usually of the assertive instrument ,  as bronze can be .  The grand form offered a scale of more or less assimilation to the form hidden in the wood , the surface a scale of textures , on both of which the sculptors played , and they are a <head>source</head> of specific qualities of the genre . A final chapter is devoted to four case studies :  Michael Erhart of Ulm ,  Tilmann Riemenschneider of Wurzburg ,  Veit Stoss of Nuremberg ,  and Hans Leinberger of Landshut .  These short studies are in part historical ,  but partly art criticism ;  the study of Leinberger is particularly relevant ,  as it comments both on an encounter with a sculpture and the problems of reading about it .

Beyond which ,  a disbeliever in astrology can find quite other ways of categorising artists .  A final caution about using monographs about painters is that they can seldom be read alone .  Historical background is only compressed in a monograph ; biographical material may be more extensive in other <head>sources</head> ; the painter 's contemporaries will not receive much attention , and may be slighted . Even illustrations may not be adequate ,  details of pictures often being poorly represented ,  leaving an artist 's  techniques ,  materials and handling to be discovered from more specialist studies .  The reader can hope ,  all the same ,  that the writer will give an account of the special merits of key pictures ,  and it is these art critical passages which can be of most help in enjoying or appreciating the chosen artist 's  achievement .

Van Gogh is famous not only for his art ,  but for his writing .  He did not write an autobiography ,  but his letters have been a source of fascination to a wide audience ,  especially artists .  Luckily , he had a correspondent in his brother Theo in whom he could confide and with whom he could explore ideas about art ; the letters are thus an invaluable <head>source</head> of interpretation . From the distance of a century ,  some of Van Gogh 's  enthusiastic appraisals of the art of his time look curious ;  but then ,  this artist acting as a critic was especially vulnerable to admiring art with a moral purpose ,  or work from which he was able to draw inspiration .  Private letters are like a conversation overheard ,  often more revealing than an autobiography ,  or than a diary which may have been written with more than half an intention of allowing it to be published .

One should add that Buckley takes the Christian myth for granted ,  as backdrop to the discourse .  But one must remember that the divergent reading of the Christian myth by Reformation and Counter - Reformation is at the heart of the religious as opposed to the rough interpretation of the conflict .  The importance of the protestant variant should not be underestimated given the extent of religious practice and the power of religious men within the protestant loyalist bloc and the grave importance of conceiving of one 's position as absolutely irreproachable , depending as it does on a divine <head>source</head> . At the heart ,  or within the innermost wall of the protestant  loyalist alliance ,  is the man of God  not woman ,  not rough ,  and not immoral  be he soldier ,  clergyman ,  businessman ,  or farmer .  After the account of creation and redemption ,  which despite the variance among intellectual accounts in the past probably has slightly less relevance as a divider at the popular level ,  the two main variants begin  ( for popular accounts ,  see Harris 1972 ;  Leyton 1975 )  .

Citizens then act as witnesses in the courts and finally may compose the jury  the real judge of guilt and innocence .

The conclusion to the argument will be that there is a specific form of violence of a political kind outside of state control which cannot be reduced to crime .

From the early 1940s ,  the Irish government began to work towards the introduction of a comprehensive health service for mothers and children in line with other legislative developments in Western countries .

As has already been seen ,  it was the style of both church and politicians to avoid their mutual consultations being known ,  which tells us that the secularity of the state at that time was partially a faade ,  but one which it was felt by both interested parties had to be maintained ,  probably so as not to confuse the faithful .  In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 ,  while an extensive health bill was going through parliament ,  the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority ,  without qualification ,  is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family ,  the Church in education ,  the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions  (  Irish Independent  ,  12 Apr. 1951 ,  quoted Whyte 1980 :  143 )  .  It appeared that one of the main <head>sources</head> of the bishops ' opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation . That the bishops were  affected by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme  clearly they stood to lose money and independence if such a scheme were implemented  seems likely .  Whereas similar provisions in other countries were mainly designed to provide facilities which could or could not be used ,  the Irish ones were to be compulsory and there was to be no choice of doctor .

The Roman catholic hierarchy declared that they had no opposition to this particular change ,  but one wonders how the vote would have gone if they had .

But Roman catholic adoption agencies , the <head>source</head> for the majority of children awaiting adoption , are not obliged to assign baptized Roman catholic children to such couples , and whether they do or not is not a matter of public knowledge . The episode shows ,  as Whyte says ,  not a clash between Church and State but a shifting consensus involving them both ,   ( 1980 : 399 )  .  A further significant change in political religious attitudes occurred with the liberalization of legislation prohibiting contraceptives to be bought or sold ,  or even imported into the state .

Since topping up ,  rather than full replacement ,  is the favoured option for caterers ,  the first worry is matching up.

Identify a selection of cutlery distributors ,  send them one of your pieces of cutlery and ask them to match it and send their sample and yours back .

I had , as I have said , hardly any money left , so with no new <head>sources</head> of income on the horizon , the sensible thing to do was to sleep rough . I left the station and started down the road to Harwich town .  A little way along ,  I saw a path running up the bank to my left and on the top of this bank there was a rather eccentric mock - Gothic porchway .

The memory of those few hours is etched on my mind .  They were typical of part of what it was like to be homeless  having nowhere to go ;  having to avoid all representatives of authority ;  feeling tired and generally run - down ;  and needing to have my wits at their sharpest at a time when they had become critically undernourished .  People of all shapes and sizes became my biggest threat and a vital potential <head>source</head> of assistance . And there was all that seemingly interminable ,  lonely hanging around .  Feeling conspicuous  embarrassed about my very existence but resentful of what had happened .

Ever dug up a bed of apparently flourishing potatoes ,  only to find the tubers riddles with holes where the slugs have been at them ?

Slugs turn to the potato crop in late summer , when other food <head>sources</head> are disappearing . Once started ,  there is little you can to to stop them ,  and the damage increases greatly in September .  A good solution is to harvest the crop early in September ,  storing the tubers out of harms way .

Plant pests are herbivores ,  eating foliage or sucking the sap ,  while predators are carnivorous and live by feeding on plants pests ,  directly or by laying their eggs among colonies so that their larvae have a ready supply of food .

Attract birds to the garden by feeding them when their natural <head>sources</head> of food are scarce ; grow plants favoured by insect predators ( like limnanthes , cornflowers , eschscholzia , asters , chrysanthemums , robinia , philadelphus and spiraea ) , and respect the habitats of retiring predators such as beetles , frogs and bats .

Their elongated stems with few small leaves strive upwards until they find sufficient light ,  and this can be seen when sun - loving species are planted in shady parts of the garden .  Similarly ,  congested seedlings will become thin and drawn ,  with soft ,  weak stems that eventually collapse from being forced .  And where the <head>source</head> of light comes mostly from one side , as when plants are growing under a hedge , stems often bend and stretch in that direction . The tendency to move or grow towards light is called phototropism .  For these reasons ,  when tackling the problem of gardening in the shade it is important to choose plants proficient at extracting energy from limited sunlight .

Once again ,  however ,  defensiveness won the day and when the Strathclyde Centre circulated forces asking them to co - operate in the venture ,  a decision was taken to withhold co - operation and a circular went round to this effect ,  suggesting the existing Home Office funded PRSU  ( Police Research Services  Unit )  and the Home Office Research and Planning Unit were adequate for the needs of the service .

Such relative positions were clearly set out for me in chains of metaphoric relevance ,  with real polises largely symbolized by the use of the body and its social and physical space .

Quite clearly ,  as costs were four times direct revenue ,  10 per cent  ( for example )  saving in costs had much more effect on the balance than did a potential 20 per cent increase in revenue ,  so energy was at first concentrated on the cost base .  A significant feature was the realisation that BR 's  policy to refurbish and life - extend the ageing fleet of diesel multiple units involved an enormous additional expense in the sudden requirement to extract all their blue and white asbestos .

When we hear of such cases , we investigate and draw on as many <head>sources</head> as possible to find out what happened In one sense it 's  very much like good investigative journalism ,  explains Malcolm Smart ,  Head of Research at the IS .  The information comes to the IS through myriad channels ,  some of them formal  over 1,100 newspapers ,  journals ,  government bulletins and transcripts of radio broadcasts are sifted  and others that are less predictable .

This comparison has fazed  her ,  as she only knows about Lee Krasner as the widow of Jackson Pollock ;  so the library visit is intended to check out reproductions of Lee Krasner 's  work ,  to see if she has to concede that her friend may be right .

Among the <head>sources</head> she will find are critical reviews , articles , catalogues and books about New York painting of the 1940s and 1950s , which will remind her that Pollock died in 1956 . There is no shortage of writing about Pollock ;  like other star artists ,  he has an embarrassingly large number of apologists ,  but fortunately there are select bibliographies which can guide her to key publications .  There may ,  however ,  be questions in her mind about the choices open to her :  how will the information in a catalogue differ from what is to be found in a monograph ?

There is no need to be intimidated by the formality of a staid institution 's  catalogue ,  or to neglect popular magazines ;  as for writing in various academic disciplines ,  there ought to be no barrier to learning about an interesting topic .

The properties of the material made limewood sculpture a special medium .  It was a medium of the grand form and of the surface ,  whether polychrome or monochrome ;  it was not a positive medium of the middle forms ,  like oak ,  or even usually of the assertive instrument ,  as bronze can be .  The grand form offered a scale of more or less assimilation to the form hidden in the wood , the surface a scale of textures , on both of which the sculptors played , and they are a <head>source</head> of specific qualities of the genre . A final chapter is devoted to four case studies :  Michael Erhart of Ulm ,  Tilmann Riemenschneider of Wurzburg ,  Veit Stoss of Nuremberg ,  and Hans Leinberger of Landshut .  These short studies are in part historical ,  but partly art criticism ;  the study of Leinberger is particularly relevant ,  as it comments both on an encounter with a sculpture and the problems of reading about it .

Beyond which ,  a disbeliever in astrology can find quite other ways of categorising artists .  A final caution about using monographs about painters is that they can seldom be read alone .  Historical background is only compressed in a monograph ; biographical material may be more extensive in other <head>sources</head> ; the painter 's contemporaries will not receive much attention , and may be slighted . Even illustrations may not be adequate ,  details of pictures often being poorly represented ,  leaving an artist 's  techniques ,  materials and handling to be discovered from more specialist studies .  The reader can hope ,  all the same ,  that the writer will give an account of the special merits of key pictures ,  and it is these art critical passages which can be of most help in enjoying or appreciating the chosen artist 's  achievement .

Van Gogh is famous not only for his art ,  but for his writing .  He did not write an autobiography ,  but his letters have been a source of fascination to a wide audience ,  especially artists .  Luckily , he had a correspondent in his brother Theo in whom he could confide and with whom he could explore ideas about art ; the letters are thus an invaluable <head>source</head> of interpretation . From the distance of a century ,  some of Van Gogh 's  enthusiastic appraisals of the art of his time look curious ;  but then ,  this artist acting as a critic was especially vulnerable to admiring art with a moral purpose ,  or work from which he was able to draw inspiration .  Private letters are like a conversation overheard ,  often more revealing than an autobiography ,  or than a diary which may have been written with more than half an intention of allowing it to be published .

One should add that Buckley takes the Christian myth for granted ,  as backdrop to the discourse .  But one must remember that the divergent reading of the Christian myth by Reformation and Counter - Reformation is at the heart of the religious as opposed to the rough interpretation of the conflict .  The importance of the protestant variant should not be underestimated given the extent of religious practice and the power of religious men within the protestant loyalist bloc and the grave importance of conceiving of one 's position as absolutely irreproachable , depending as it does on a divine <head>source</head> . At the heart ,  or within the innermost wall of the protestant  loyalist alliance ,  is the man of God  not woman ,  not rough ,  and not immoral  be he soldier ,  clergyman ,  businessman ,  or farmer .  After the account of creation and redemption ,  which despite the variance among intellectual accounts in the past probably has slightly less relevance as a divider at the popular level ,  the two main variants begin  ( for popular accounts ,  see Harris 1972 ;  Leyton 1975 )  .

The conclusion to the argument will be that there is a specific form of violence of a political kind outside of state control which cannot be reduced to crime .

From the early 1940s ,  the Irish government began to work towards the introduction of a comprehensive health service for mothers and children in line with other legislative developments in Western countries .

As has already been seen ,  it was the style of both church and politicians to avoid their mutual consultations being known ,  which tells us that the secularity of the state at that time was partially a faade ,  but one which it was felt by both interested parties had to be maintained ,  probably so as not to confuse the faithful .  In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 ,  while an extensive health bill was going through parliament ,  the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority ,  without qualification ,  is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family ,  the Church in education ,  the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions  (  Irish Independent  ,  12 Apr. 1951 ,  quoted Whyte 1980 :  143 )  .  It appeared that one of the main <head>sources</head> of the bishops ' opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation . That the bishops were  affected by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme  clearly they stood to lose money and independence if such a scheme were implemented  seems likely .  Whereas similar provisions in other countries were mainly designed to provide facilities which could or could not be used ,  the Irish ones were to be compulsory and there was to be no choice of doctor .

The Roman catholic hierarchy declared that they had no opposition to this particular change ,  but one wonders how the vote would have gone if they had .

But Roman catholic adoption agencies , the <head>source</head> for the majority of children awaiting adoption , are not obliged to assign baptized Roman catholic children to such couples , and whether they do or not is not a matter of public knowledge . The episode shows ,  as Whyte says ,  not a clash between Church and State but a shifting consensus involving them both ,   ( 1980 : 399 )  .  A further significant change in political religious attitudes occurred with the liberalization of legislation prohibiting contraceptives to be bought or sold ,  or even imported into the state .

Since topping up ,  rather than full replacement ,  is the favoured option for caterers ,  the first worry is matching up.

Identify a selection of cutlery distributors ,  send them one of your pieces of cutlery and ask them to match it and send their sample and yours back .

This is not only a <head>source</head> of plant foods , but also encourages earthworm activity .

Ever dug up a bed of apparently flourishing potatoes ,  only to find the tubers riddles with holes where the slugs have been at them ?  The major culprit is the keeled slug ,  dark grey or black with a distinct ridge down its back ,  which lives mostly in the soil .  Slugs turn to the potato crop in late summer , when other food <head>sources</head> are disappearing . Once started ,  there is little you can to to stop them ,  and the damage increases greatly in September .  A good solution is to harvest the crop early in September ,  storing the tubers out of harms way .

Plant pests are herbivores ,  eating foliage or sucking the sap ,  while predators are carnivorous and live by feeding on plants pests ,  directly or by laying their eggs among colonies so that their larvae have a ready supply of food .  The commonest predators are ladybirds ,  hoverflies ,  lacewings ,  ground beetles ,  centipedes and insectivorous birds ,  together with frogs ,  toads and hedgehogs .  Attract birds to the garden by feeding them when their natural <head>sources</head> of food are scarce ; grow plants favoured by insect predators ( like limnanthes , cornflowers , eschscholzia , asters , chrysanthemums , robinia , philadelphus and spiraea ) , and respect the habitats of retiring predators such as beetles , frogs and bats .

Their elongated stems with few small leaves strive upwards until they find sufficient light ,  and this can be seen when sun - loving species are planted in shady parts of the garden .  Similarly ,  congested seedlings will become thin and drawn ,  with soft ,  weak stems that eventually collapse from being forced .  And where the <head>source</head> of light comes mostly from one side , as when plants are growing under a hedge , stems often bend and stretch in that direction . The tendency to move or grow towards light is called phototropism .  For these reasons ,  when tackling the problem of gardening in the shade it is important to choose plants proficient at extracting energy from limited sunlight .

After a little more flying experience ,  beginners '  eyes interpret what is happening to the aircraft and the alarm signal is no longer sent on to the brain .

I realized I would need to convince them at the first opportunity that I was primarily a practical policeman and not an academic ;  and I also noted that while the college was keen to list the academic qualifications of those on the course ,  the participants quickly justified Lewis 's  assertions by playing them down to emphasize their history of praxis and practical mastery .

The vast  library on police matters was clearly under - used and there is obviously a need for a critical ethnography of the college itself ,  for it takes in numbers of senior and middle police managers each year ,  maintains a considerable staff of academics and visiting lecturers ,  but has singularly failed to provide an academically stimulating university of policing .  Even the civilian academics at the college seem to be nullified by the overriding police desire for circumspection in the written account and the preference for academic silence .  It could be anticipated that the college would have seen the creation of a continuous stream of books and papers generated by the rich <head>source</head> of material which pours through its gates , but this has hardly been the case .

Once again ,  however ,  defensiveness won the day and when the Strathclyde Centre circulated forces asking them to co - operate in the venture ,  a decision was taken to withhold co - operation and a circular went round to this effect ,  suggesting the existing Home Office funded PRSU  ( Police Research Services  Unit )  and the Home Office Research and Planning Unit were adequate for the needs of the service .

However ,  I have never seen a copy of this circulated at the subdivision level at any location I have worked ;  and outside force HQ the availability of any research or analytic literature on policing falls off dramatically .

The derogatory phrase he 's  not a real polis ;  he 'll never be a polis as long as he 's  got a hole in his arse quickly set out markers to define who was one of us and who was not.

Such relative positions were clearly set out for me in chains of metaphoric relevance ,  with real polises largely symbolized by the use of the body and its social and physical space .

One further consequence of attributing pre - eminence to quantity in relation to detection rates means that the prig who clears his slate  ( admits to lots of crimes ,  no matter how trivial )  becomes a prized catch ,  simply because he helps the figures .  His arrest ,  as I have suggested ,  will often be made by a uniform polis whose  physical handling of the body  ( the person apprehended )  will be tempered by an acute awareness of the need to maintain physical domination .

The <head>source</head> of energy for a muscle contraction is Adenosine Triphosphate ( A.T.P . ) and this occurs in very small amounts in human muscle .

The splitting of the A.T.P .  and C.P. molecules is the prime source of muscular energy .

Not surprisingly ,  the Department of Transport ,  and in consequence the British Railways Board ,  maintained a policy of aiming to reduce the PSO so as to reduce the demands on the taxpayer .  Nationalised industries were first set annual cash limits under a Labour administration ,  but the concept was in line with Conservative Government policy to cut direct  taxation and release cash so that people  ( voters )  had a greater choice with what to do with their money .  John Welsby was appointed as the first Director , Provincial , and he set about evaluating the <head>sources</head> of the sector 's costs . Quite clearly ,  as costs were four times direct revenue ,  10 per cent  ( for example )  saving in costs had much more effect on the balance than did a potential 20 per cent increase in revenue ,  so energy was at first concentrated on the cost base .  A significant feature was the realisation that BR 's  policy to refurbish and life - extend the ageing fleet of diesel multiple units involved an enormous additional expense in the sudden requirement to extract all their blue and white asbestos .
