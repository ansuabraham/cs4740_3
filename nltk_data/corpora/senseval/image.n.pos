The Sri Lankan government has moved to try to counter the criticisms of its human rights record .  In November ,  a Presidential Task Force on human rights was set up ,  consisting of senior figures close to President Premadasa .  Its main function , however , appears to be to present a better <head>image</head> of Sri Lanka to the outside world . More promising was the inauguration in January 1991 of a Commission of Enquiry into new cases of disappearance .  This Commission consists of five senior members of the judiciary and legal profession .

They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,  partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro ,  who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,  was an open - minded historian of this sort .  He wrote enthusiastically about the later work of Arshile Gorky : Gorky 's atmosphere , veiling the hard opaque wall of the canvas , evokes a nocturnal void or the vague , unstable <head>image</head> - space of the day - dreaming mind . And he remembered the painter :  I used to meet him most often in the museums and galleries fixed in rapt contemplation of pictures with that grave ,  searching look which was one of the beauties of his face .

William J. Ivins was curator of prints at the Metropolitan Museum from 1916 to 1946 .  In How Prints Look  ,  first published in 1943 ,  he wrote an elementary introduction to the appearances  ( the outward and visible signs )  of prints ,  and cautioned that :  Most of the time spent over it should be given to looking at its pictures .  The caption material under two <head>images</head> reads as follows : In the middle nineteenth century , before photography was in general use , Pilinski of Paris was famous ( and notorious ) for the deceptiveness of his copies of old woodcuts . This is an enlargement from an original fifteenth - century woodcut .  On the opposite page is Pilinski 's  wood - engraved copy .

A successful description of a self - portrait may not be difficult ,  but an illuminating interpretation may call on many references ,  especially other artists '  pictures of themselves .  What can be deduced from a self - portrait is often controversial ;  a critic is especially likely to read into a self - portrait some opinion held about the artist .  When , as in the cases of Rembrandt and Van Gogh , there is a whole series of pictures to choose from , books can be written on the self - <head>images</head> of one artist alone . This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's  writing ,  since it tempts the rash into speculation ,  while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons .  A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .

As in books on the philosophy of art ,  or aesthetics ,  many do not in fact contain any art criticism ,  in the sense of description ,  interpretation and judgement of individual works .  Their strengths are rather in clearing the ground of preconceived ideas about the arts ,  and putting new points of view .  When works of art are described only those aspects of an <head>image</head> important to the argument are included . It is in this arena that some of the fiercest intellectual fighting about art is taking place ,  though the contests range wider than the visual arts to politics and economics .  For example ,  Chadwick states :  There can be no simple category defined as feminist art history ,  since the effect of new ideas is that much recent scholarly writing has shifted attention from the categories art and artist to broader issues concerning ideologies of gender ,  sexuality ,  and power .

There are other ways of description ,  which may incidentally be employed by a critic ,  or can be useful to a reader as a check on the validity of a verbal description .  In chapter 4 ,  on monographs ,  there were some comments on the photography of art as a complement to criticism ;  there are some other issues about how accurate or misleading photographs can be .  Perhaps this is the more important in the late twentieth century now that this means of <head>image</head> - making is so familiar that some people actually imagine that a photograph shows the world as it is . In truth ,  the camera is a ruthless editor of visual information ;  this can be made plain by looking at a picture ,  say of the eighteenth century ,  and comparing it with a contemporary print ,  perhaps an aquatint ,  and a modern photograph .  The images carry different information .

After all ,  it is an original work in itself .  Nevertheless ,  the differences between painting and print may be instructive ,  and help the interpretation of both .  By other forms of reproduction an <head>image</head> may be more or less degraded , so that nothing can be learnt from them . There remains the courtesy paid by one art to another ,  as in the poem which Baudelaire suggested might be a high form of critical writing .

Levi was an author who ,  without detriment to the other people who figure in his books ,  wrote all the time about himself ,  both in autobiographical and in fictional form .  The modes which he adopted were such as to  license  elisions and lacunae ,  to enable him to leave out bits of his life  a procedure  which would seem to be connected with his scepticism about what can be known about people by biographers .  In Moments of Reprieve he remarks : What the true <head>image</head> of each of us may be in the end is a meaningless question . In The Periodic Table  he mentions a woman dear to my heart who was murdered at Auschwitz :  but the book on Auschwitz does not discuss his relationship with her .  In The Wrench  he creates the rigger Faussone ,  the practical man whose cranes girdle the world and who keeps returning ,  a little heavy - footed ,  to the house in Turin where two old aunts fuss over his welfare :  Faussone was spoken of as my alter ego ,  and the book has to struggle to accommodate him as a second person ,  available for interview by Levi .

And it  has to be said ,  he wrote ,  that its opposite ,  a feeling of elation ,  equally physical ,  equally extra - physical ,  has also been a constant feature of my life ,  manifesting itself regularly though impossible to predict ,  a reeling in the chest this time ,  the chest and perhaps the throat ,  a feeling of the heart leaping and the blood pumping ,  it came when I first took up a brush and made a mark on paper ,  it came when I picked up the first readymade and felt it transformed by that very action ,  it came when Madge rang to say she could not go on ,  when Annie wrote to say she was not coming back ,  when the idea of the glass first popped into my head .  So ,  wrote Harsnet ,  there is continuity as well as discontinuity ,  but that does not mean ,  he wrote ,  that there exists what is called character ,  personality ,  character  ,  Goldberg wrote in the margin ,  personality  ,  as they seem to think ,  wrote Harsnet  ( and Goldberg went on typing )  ,  when they say you have such a generous character if you would only recognize it ,  or you have so much to offer ,  or it is not for myself I speak but for you ,  not for myself I mourn but for the waste of all that generosity ,  when they pour those words over you ,  character ,  generosity ,  warmth ,  looking sad ,  shedding tears ,  putting on a brave face ,  saying do n't pay any attention to me ,  or ,  it 's  nothing ,  forget it ,  I 'm crying for the waste ,  meaning waste if it 's  not directed towards them ,  but you have only to see what happens when one lets oneself be persuaded by that sort of thing ,  wrote Harsnet ,  you have only to see what happened to Hutchinson ,  MacMahon ,  Rollins and Goldberg .  Taken in by the <head>image</head> of yourself they present you with , wrote Harsnet , instead of waiting in patience for the beginning , instead of waiting and then beginning , though beginning , having begun , he wrote , is not everything , is far from everything . It is quite possible ,  he wrote ,  that it will lead nowhere ,  even when one has begun at the right time in the right spirit ,  or at least not at the wrong time ,  in the wrong spirit ,  with the wrong plans and having made the wrong preparations ,  with the wrong tools and the wrong principles ,  on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception .  Though it may well be ,  he wrote ,  that one actually achieves  more working with the wrong plans and in the wrong spirit ,  with the wrong tools and the wrong principles ,  on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception ,  it may well be ,  he wrote  ( and Goldberg typed )  ,  that one achieves more than working with the right plans and in the right spirit ,  with the right tools and the right principles ,  on the right surface and with the right conception ,  though right and wrong and more and less are relative concepts and what seems right at one moment to one person may seem wrong at the same moment to another Person or at another moment to the same person ,  and what seems more to one person at one moment may seem less to another person at the same moment or at another moment to the same person ,  right ,  wrong ,  more ,  less ,  relative concepts  ,  scribbled Goldberg ,  in the margin ,  panting slightly as he bent over his old Olivetti Portable ,  there is only the beginning ,  wrote Harsnet ,  or rather ,  there is only having begun ,  beginning  ,  scribbled Goldberg ,  aware now of the black stains on his hands left by the felt - tip pen ,  having begun  ,  there is only the feeling in the pit of the stomach or the feeling in the chest ,  wrote Harsnet ,  the feeling of sickness or the feeling of elation ,  those are not relative ,  he wrote ,  those are absolute .

In extreme cases anthropologists have found such a role impossible to live with ,  for the field situation was beyond their previous imaginations .

As a result , he necessarily developed a new self - <head>image</head> , and took on a new social personality in the process . In Castenada 's  case ,  he enters a world so different that he comes to accept reality itself as nothing but a social construct ,  with effects so devastating that ethnography becomes mysticism  ( Goward 1984 :  90 )  .  For Jeanne Favret - Saada  ( 1980 )  ,  who set out to study witchcraft in the French Bocage ,  the only means of moving in on the discourse she hoped to understand was to become part of it .

Just as the white - coated doctors in hospitals symbolize the clean and purifying nature of the healer ,  so the dark uniform of the police symbolizes not just the force identity ,  but also the presence of the avenger ,  who purifies through retribution rather than by cure .  It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force  police service which remains unresolved ,  on which I will say more later in relation to the role of women police officers .  The dark uniform we wore had a military cap with polished brim , and in our fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boots we presented an avenging <head>image</head> , clothed in the symbolic colour of death and darkness . Black is a light absorbent ,  non - reflective colour and most suitable for controllers who operate with a degree of social anonymity ,  upholding the rule of law and the abstractions of the legal system .  In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .

In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .  As Reiner  ( 1980 )  suggested ,  the riot gear in which the police are increasingly seen ,  with shields ,  visored helmets ,  knee - length boots ,  and flame - proof overalls ,  enhances their avenging appearance .  I suspect it is no accident the politics of the times seems to parallel the growing toughness of the police <head>image</head> , or that the police have taken on an increasing resemblance to the black - clothed enemies of goodness who sprinkle the popular science fantasy films such as Star Wars , Superman , and the like . In these mass cultural replays of the eternal dichotomy between good and evil ,  the use of highly symbolic black uniforms as an indicator of anonymous evil predominates .  Within the separate police forces ,  the nuances of uniform difference were always embroidered by real polises to produce symbolic boundaries from which to assess other uniform wearers .

Leonard Cohen is a man of medium height ,  five - feet ,  eight - inches  ( 173 cm )  ;  lean ,  with a rugged ,  world - weary face .  He looks like a man who should be heavier than he is ,  and one soon realises that an iron discipline keeps it that way .  He enjoys his food and wine , but disallows its enjoyment to distort the <head>image</head> which is important chiefly to himself , and then to his public . He is frequently described as having the stoop of an ageing crop - picker and the face of a curious little boy  which may have been true 30 years ago ,  but now belongs to the discard - tray with other caricatures :  caricatures ,  as Oscar Wilde observed ,  are compliments that mediocrity pays to genius .  Greying a little at the temples ,  Leonard unconsciously confirms why he is labelled one of Canada 's  sexiest men ,  a handsome and elegant man with dark eyes  ( they are said to be green ,  but that never showed in the light of Montreal ,  nor in its wintry sunshine )  .

Omitting his radical change of direction  ( i.e. of subject )  in his second year ,  it represents a demand of surrealist proportions ,  especially when one considers that alongside these he was reading French ,  Latin ,  Mathematics ,  Philosophy and History .  His task ,  one of unending and heady excitement ,  was now well and truly under way !  Little wonder that he sometimes gave the impression of inattentiveness in class ; he was inebriated in a world of letters , engulfed by an avalanche of ideas and <head>images</head> , forms and metres , essays and critiques : a fast - changing , provocative kaleidoscope which took his already well - stocked and fertile mind to fresh heights . Paradise it was not ;  but at least it resembled something like its antechamber .  He plunged himself into all this and more ,  avidly reading everything that came his way ;  especially poetry ,  and not least Spanish ,  Chinese and Japanese poets in translation ,  but chiefly that of Federico Garia Lorca and W.B. Yeats ,  of whom he mused ,  I loved Yeats ;  his connections  ( such an important code - word with Leonard !  )  his rhythms .

Layton described the four things which stand out in Leonard ,  which give him the confidence to work as he does ,  and promote his work :  The strong tradition of learning ;  the business entrepreneurship of his family ;  the broad philanthropy/charity which hall - marked it ;  and ,  lastly ,  the self - awareness that comes from being a Cohen  not understood as class - distinction ,  but from the high symbolism of the priest and his role .  This latter is particularly interesting .  It was raised by Dudek in somewhat different form when he said that Leonard always had an <head>image</head> of himself as a rabbi . We are talking of two very perceptive men  whose mtier is perception ;  and their recollection of Leonard at this young age ,  his late teenage years .  Layton put it somewhat differently when he added that the two great qualities a young writer has are his arrogance and inexperience ,  and on another occasion he picked out the twin characteristics of precocity and  independence .

As I shall explain in the next section ,  this earlier privileging of intellect was intimately connected with resistance to nominalism ,  and ,  in the seventeenth century nominalism triumphed .  The emphasis on the mentality and immateriality of sense experience was associated with the denial that there was anything special about intellect .  Even whilst developing the modern immaterialist notion of consciousness , the eighteenth - century empiricists and others were attacking the dignity of intellect and assimilating it to sensory activity by treating thoughts as mere <head>images</head> . As well as being a defence of mind ,  therefore ,  the early modern philosophy ,  through its nominalism ,  was also an attack on it .  And ,  in certain important respects ,  the general form of this attack is preserved in contemporary physicalist theories .

( See the discussions of these developments elsewhere in this book ,  particularly Chapters 4 and 7 .  )  And it has led to the introduction of new technologies for the direct investigation of the relationships between brain ,  behaviour and external events ,  the subject of the present chapter .  Most current procedures for recording the electrical activity of the brain , or producing radiographic <head>images</head> of the living human brain , or investigating the accuracy and timing of behaviour are dependent on computing capacity which was not available twenty years ago. But many of the techniques which computers are enabling us to exploit are not new .

So again ,  laboratory techniques were affording scientists a glimpse of their subjects '  mental lives .  The brain is not only an electrical machine ,  it also has a physical and chemical structure and these too are now being monitored in the living brain .  By using computers to integrate the information from a large number of different viewpoints round the skull , it is possible to visualize the appearance of a slice through the brain and build up a full three - dimensional <head>image</head> . The viewing medium can be X - rays ,  as in computerized tomographic  ( CT )  scans ;  magnetic resonance of atomic nuclei ,  as in nuclear magnetic resonance  ( NMR )  scans ;  or emission from radioactively labelled substances incorporated into the structure of nerve cells as in positron emission tomographic  ( PET )  scans .  These obviously have considerable clinical value for localizing and identifying areas of brain abnormality ,  but they also enable areas of activity in the normally functioning brain to be pictured .

Nevertheless ,  they have demonstrated activity in the visual areas during an imaging task ,  in the language areas during a verbal task and even ,  on one  -  occasion ,  in the higher visual areas of a schizophrenic patient who subsequently reported that he had been hallucinating .  Remarkable as these observations are ,  they are currently only confirming what was known already about localization within the brain .

Which is interesting because here the three of us are ,  thinking about what it means to belong somewhere ,  what it might mean to belong to this idea called theatre .

This is illustrated in Fig. 6 ,  showing typical mapping from the start of the four bit plane base addresses and the first line of pixels on the screen .  The main body of a bit image file consists of data bytes with bit mapping similar to figs 3 to 5 .  Bit <head>image</head> files normally have a fixed format header giving general information about the file and its format . One way to handle different bit mapping schemes is to include in the header details such as the number of bit planes ,  bits per pixel ,  pixels per scan line ,  and the number of scan lines .

Since data compression relies on redundancy in the information to be compressed ,  performance is affected by the nature of the data .  There are various methods which can be used for  computer files  ( see box Getting quarts into pint pots )  .  Run Length Limitation ( RLL ) is probably the most common for bit <head>image</head> files , although the LZW algorithm is also in use . In the future ,  compression using techniques from digital TV ,  or based on fractal theory ,  could become important .  Another problem is compatibility .

However high you choose this super resolution ,  the day will come when it 's  not enough .  Another point is that it would make most bit image files far longer than necessary .

Like video ram most graphics files support colour by ,  in effect ,  indexing into a look up table .  If a drawing description file refers to COLOUR 1 ,  the actual colour will be whatever colour 1 is set to .  Similarly , if a 16 colour bit <head>image</head> file format refers to red , green , blue and intensity planes , this will only be true of the default palette settings . However ,  it is quite common for graphics files to allow a colour table to be included ,  thus defining the palette .

A 16 colour PCX file header ,  for example ,  includes a 48 byte colour table .  Each colour is defined by 3 bytes ,  one for each of the primary additive colours ,  red ,  green and blue .  Most printers are monochrome , but the often have a higher resolution than bit <head>image</head> date . Thus they can convert colour to a grey scale by a process called dithering .  Although each printer pixel can normally be only black or white ,  a grey scale can be produced by varying the proportion of black to white dots .

When wider bandwidth networking became available ,  the ability to move graphical information quickly around a network brought the cental multi user processor concept into the wimps era ,  and this has required clearly defined standards for the Graphical User Interface  ( GUI )  .

It is largely based on the bit <head>image</head> approach , and assumes a resolution of around 100 pixels per inch , which could become a limitation in the future . However ,  X is very widely supported ,  and is associated with the Unix operating system and the move to open standards in the IT industry .

Eagleton 's  Althusserian phase of the mid - 1970s was strongly attacked by a Marxist academic ,  Kiernan Ryan ,  who has since taken issue with another Marxist ,  Alan Sinfield ,  on the extent to which the great literary works of the past can transcend the reactionary ideologies that produced them .  Sinfield believed that they were often irredeemably tainted by ideology ,  at best to be read only in historical terms ,  or subject to symptomatic readings ,  seeking the fractures and fissures in the mystified surface of the text that showed the true ideological conditions in which it was produced .  Against this , Ryan advanced the humanistic belief that the major canonical texts are not inherently reactionary , and that they contain implicit <head>images</head> and models of human freedom which transcend their immediate historical context and which later readers can respond to . This is an interestingly eclectic argument which recalls Gadamer on the fusion of horizons  ( the reader 's  and the text 's  )  ,  Marcuse on the utopian possibilities of high culture ,  and Sartre on the necessarily progressive implications of major literature .  Ryan represents a kind of Marxism that non - Marxists might do business with ,  in the sense that one can make a rational engagement with it .

The real problem is that the writers of such texts may make political difficulties within a department ,  or teach in ways difficult for students to understand .  Again ,  English departments can be unhelpful about participating in schemes for training academics how to teach ,  claiming that teaching literature is less easily defined and methodologized than teaching engineering or economics .  At a time when a good public <head>image</head> is essential for universities , English is unable to explain itself in ways immediately intelligible to the outsider , is notoriously riven with doubts and disagreements that prevent it from having a shared sense of purpose , and may at intervals erupt into crises that attract the wrong sort of publicity .

The adjacent social sciences provide the model for a genuine professionalism and accountability .

It still seems to me that the acting critics of poesy are for the most part incapable of looking for more than one thing at a time ,  having got started about 1913  ( I mean a few of em got started about 1913 and a lot have started since )  to look for a certain plainness and directness of speech and simple order of words ;  and having about 1918 got started  looking for Mr Eliot 's  rather more fragile system  ( a system excellent for Mr Eliot but not very much use to any one else )  ,  they now limit their criticism to inquiring whether or no verse conforms to one or other of these manners ,  thereby often omitting to notice fundamentals ,  or qualities as important as verbal directness and even more important than snap .  The meaning of snap in relation to Eliot 's  rather more fragile system is at this date ,  I suppose ,  irrecoverable ;  but the general drift of these remarks is clear .  And this is not the only place in The Exile where Pound shows himself restive inside the <head>image</head> of himself that had been built up among initiates by his propaganda of fifteen years before , when he had taken over imagism and championed Ford Madox Ford 's ideas about a diction for poetry that should be plain and direct .

In fact the original eighteen poems of the Hardy sequence ,   ( in the Collected Poems  of 1919 ,  he damagingly extended it by three extra pieces )  tell a story of the poet 's  pilgrimage to his and Emma 's  early haunts ,  matching the stages of the journey there and back to specific stages of Aeneas 's  journey ,  in Aeneid  6 ,  to the abode of the blest .  It thus represents ,  on the part of the supposedly non - modernist Hardy ,  a stratagem often taken to be definitively modernist :  the use of an ancient fable to structure and resonate with a twentieth - century narrative ,  as the Odyssey  structures and resonates with James Joyce 's  Ulysses  .

The colour - printing facility ,  initially to be used only for advertising ,  may be used to produce a weekend leisure colour supplement early next year .  I do n't believe in the fatal decline of the written word , says Mr Fontaine , but we are competing all the time not so much against television , because the screen <head>image</head> and the printed word complement each other , as against magazines , and against the time people spend getting to work and then their leisure time against music and the cinema . Not all the Le Monde journalists support the change ,  which is the result of two years '  market research and several dummy editions .  A professional designer ,  Jean Bayle ,  with a track record for breathing new life into tired titles ,  was hired but the changes he favoured were deemed rather too radical and ,  in the end  as is often the case on Le Monde where the staff hold a significant stake in the company  the consensus view prevailed .

Racing :  Haines takes reins for sweet surgery By JOHN KARTER ,  Racing Correspondent THE much - maligned men of the Jockey Club have found a sugar daddy to boost their <head>image</head> with a little cosmetic surgery . That has been the typically cynical reaction to the appointment of Christopher Haines ,  a high - flyer from the sugar industry ,  as the Club 's  first ever chief executive .

Introducing Wired ,  his biography of John Belushi ,  Bob Woodward recalls how the rigours of research involved going to bed early so as to rise at 4am to visit one of the comedian 's  favourite watering holes .  Annotated ,  logged and indexed ,  his book scarcely illuminated Belushi 's  demons ,  or the system that supposedly destroyed him. But it did summon up the delicious <head>image</head> of the straitlaced reporter gingerly dipping his toe , notebook in hand , into the showbiz underworld . The film of Wired  ( 18 )  features Woodward  ( J T Walsh )  as straight man to the podgy comedian ,  but though subtitled the laughs and times of John Belushi ,  it is woefully short on the former component .  While the book charted his passage through Chicago ,  New York and finally Los Angeles ,  it largely skips the first two circles of hell .

As the part requires an actor of substantial proportions ,  the obvious choice would be someone like John Candy or John Goodman  ( of David Byrne 's  True Stories and Channel Four 's  Roseanne )   though he may be simply too nice to play Ignatius ,  and is anyway busy perfecting his bowling technique for his upcoming appearance as Fred in the live - action version of The Flintstones .  From a slightly more elevated plane of cinematic endeavour comes news to warm the heart of Woody Allen .  Ingmar Bergman , who for some years now has been insistent that Fanny and Alexander was his farewell to the moving <head>image</head> , has decided to stage a come - back with a project called The Good Will . Set in Uppsala at the beginning of the century ,  it tells the story of Bergman 's  parents ,  and will be made for two different formats :  as a four - part series for televsion ,  and as two feature films for cinemas .  Unfortunately ,  Bergman has decided not to direct his own script ,  but has instead put it in the hands of the Danish director Bille August ,  who made Pelle the Conquerer ,  which won last year 's  Palme d'Or at Cannes and which Bergman is rumoured to like so much that he has already seen it six times .

Many East Germans say that ,  though they themselves do not want to leave ,  there is almost universal resentment at the official lies and the unbending attitudes of the authorities ,  who ,  by cancelling visa - free travel to Czechoslovakia this week ,  made it even more difficult to escape what one person called our cage .  East Germany 's  first organised opposition group ,  New Forum ,  its aims far from radical by comparison with those now being voiced in Poland and Hungary ,  was established last month even as the mass exodus began .  Jens Reich , one of its founders , said yesterday : There is much anger that the reality and the portrayed <head>image</head> are so different .  I think we have been silent too long ,  we 've tolerated too much for too long .  He said that support for the opposition was growing ,  but many were still afraid  not surprisingly ,  as opposition leaders have already had officially - inspired warnings that ,  when the weekend 's  official jubilation is over ,  there could be a new clampdown .

The Iznik pottery from Turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds ;  Iznik is now highly sought after by Turkish yuppies and prices run from 2,000 or so to 15,000 .  Both houses combine elegant early metalwares  ( twelfth/thirteenth century )  ,  bronze vessels with silver inlay  which are expensive  with nineteenth -  century imitations ,  more flashy but in the mid - hundreds .

From PETER PRINGLE in Washington AS THE post - mortem into the failed coup in Panama continued yesterday ,  it emerged that President Bush had approved an order to the US commander in the Canal Zone to remove General Manuel Noriega using covert forces ,  but the coup fizzled out before the order could be executed .

In a television interview ,  James Baker ,  the Secretary of State ,  said the Panama commander ,  General Maxwell Thurman ,  had been sent an order last Tuesday morning ,  the day of the coup ,  requiring him to seize General Noriega if there were an opportunity to do so without risking American life and without open military involvement ,  then he was free to go ahead .  The order was ,  in effect ,  an authorisation to plan a seizure ,  not to carry it out .

The supernatural is as numbed as the natural :  equipped with microphone headsets and miniature televisions ,  the witches are played as suave technocrats ,  moving among humanity with invisible malice ,  sometimes doubling as murderers .  Only in the language  spoken with clarity throughout ,  especially by Simon Tyrrell as Macbeth ,  and Peter Granger - Taylor as Ross  does any slight consolation remain .  Across ashen , unredeemable scenes , Shakespeare 's words resound with redoubled force and humanity ; they sound almost ironic , in their fruitless reaching towards the <head>images</head> and emotions which have drained away from a soulless , monochrome universe . There are times when this universe seems excessively ,  even arbitrarily ,  bleak .

Adopting techniques long employed by the solicitors '  profession ,  the brochure sets out personal accounts of government legal work by serving lawyers .  Sir Patrick said the brochure had a dual aim :  to show potential recruits that government legal work was responsible and worthwhile ;  and to dispel the notion that the service was for lawyers who had not made it in other parts of the profession .

The beautiful blue groundwash is so sensuously placid and dreamlike  ( almost aquatic )  ,  and the simple but elegant forms and lines animate the scene ,  producing in me a state of quiet limbo .  I prefer to retain my initial response to this as an abstract work ,  although I realise that Miro and his fellow Surrealists were strongly opposed to the abstract movement .  He was influenced by the leading French poets of his time : <head>images</head> seem drawn from Apollinaire 's play , Les Mamelles de Tiresias , including the large white form dominating the left of the canvas which , according to Miro , is a horse . Should we just enjoy the things that touch us in a painting or should it spur us on to learn more ?  I know that I will continue to get great pleasure from simply looking at this beautiful image .

Hamburg enjoys an extremely high level of film subsidy  -  approximately 6 million a year ,  or three times the sum available in Britain .  This generosity is ,  it seems ,  partly due to regional rivalry .  Hamburg 's local government had seen the results of generous film funding in Berlin : the city became attractive to film - makers , work came pouring in and attractive or interesting <head>images</head> of Berlin were sent around the world . Hamburg 's  decision to follow suit looks like a shining opportunity for venturesome British outfits ,  but there are snags .  Subsidies are granted only on the agreement that a set percentage of any budget must be spent in Hamburg .

THE GOVERNMENT will spend more than 1bn before the next general election to take the sting out of the poll tax .  More than half the extra money  announced at the Conservative Party conference yesterday by David Hunt ,  the local government minister  will be spent in 1991/2 ,  the last full financial year before the election .  The announcement , coming alongside the announcement of a major green White Paper next year , signalled a clear decision by the Prime Minister to smooth the rough edges of Tory <head>image</head> and policy in the pre - election period . Conference representatives responded with evident relief .  The extra cash ,  however ,  will only partly soften the impact of the introduction of the poll tax next year .

Without proof that money was paid into an account controlled by Mr Gandhi ,  there is little doubt that the Prime Minister will be able to continue resisting calls for his resignation .  But the steady drip of disclosures ,  which appears certain to continue right up to the general election later this year ,  could yet prove fatal to the Congress  ( I )  Party 's  chances of remaining in power .

They cannot imagine him as a Prime Minister ,  and they cannot imagine that the British public can be persuaded to elect him to that post .

Conservatives are foolishly lulling themselves with their own rhetoric if they think that the reformed Labour Party is an <head>image</head> - makers ' fantasy .

But dozens of representatives shouted Yes when he recalled the European election campaign and asked them :  Can any of us say in all honesty that we did everything we could ?  Much of the blame for their slide in popularity could be attributed to Cabinet ministers arguing over their official residences ,  and backbench Tory MPs taking an independent line to further their own political careers .

Mr Kinnock exploited political and City tensions over sterling yesterday with a call for the Government to enter immediate negotiations to become a full member of the European Monetary System .  John Smith ,  Labour 's  Treasury spokesman ,  is to tour a number of European capitals next week to hammer out the party 's  terms of entry .  But the gaps in Mrs Thatcher 's address reflected her own standing instruction to Cabinet colleagues : to calm down the Government 's confrontational <head>image</head> . That message ,  and yesterday 's  speech ,  contrast sharply with previous conference speeches in which the Prime Minister insisted that there could be no let - up in the long Thatcherite march .  Nevertheless ,  she did give outright support to the stand taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer .

It is stories like these which help to protect Easton 's  policemen and women from the loss of morale which Manning claims is an inevitable result of the contradiction between the image the police have of themselves and their work and the low - key nature of practical policing  ( Manning 1977 :  349 ;  also see Holdaway 1983 ,  1988 ,  who makes a similar point )  .  The conceptualizations of police work that are found in Easton not only fit what is known of police forces elsewhere ,  they parallel the portrayal of policing in the wider culture .  The <head>image</head> of policing gleaned from police programmes on British and American television and in films is very much how Easton 's police see themselves , as others have commented with respect to police forces elsewhere ( Holdaway 1983 : 147 ; Hurd 1979 ; Klockars 1983 ; Morris and Heal 1981 ; Tuska 1979 ) . The popularity of these programmes among the section police in Easton is both cause and effect of the evaluations they make of their work .  The excitement ,  suspense ,  and danger which seems the lot of the police on celluloid feeds into the definitions many of Easton 's  section police give to their work experience ,  and the supposed similarity of this experience leads them to see police films and television programmes as an accurate portrayal ,  to be watched avidly because of this shared world .

Those policemen who have racist views are faced with problems when the hero on celluloid is black ,  but when discussing such an instance ,  one policeman expressed his dislike for blacks but still found the film brilliant  ( FN 9/10/87 ,  p. 57 )  .  More importantly ,  this imagery affects the demeanour of these macho men when dealing with the public .  Sensitivity to public relations is not a quality which accompanies the Rambo self - <head>image</head> , and sergeants sometimes avoid placing the policemen who live out this imagery in situations where their insensitivity can damage public perceptions of the police . Various studies have shown that the public evaluate the police in terms of the attitude the police show them when they are victims in need of police help  ( for example ,  Jones 1983 ;  Maguire 1982 ;  Shapland 1982 ;  Southgate and Ekblom 1984 )  .  It is not always possible for low - ranking officers to anticipate the situations which Action Men need to avoid ,  and some instances were observed where the aggressive manner of the policeman acted as a form of amplification of deviance  ( Young 1971 )  ,  transforming a minor situation into big crime .

Moving on loitering youths is a policing situation ripe for such amplification ,  as other research has shown  ( Southgate and Ekblom 1986 :  35 ,  37 ;  Young 1971 )  ,  and there were several occasions when policemen for whom this imagery is very important over - reacted to the presence of young people on street corners and were aggressive in the way they moved them on .  On one occasion the aggression was returned ,  resulting in the person being brought into the station and charged .  Of course , there are other situations when the toughness that accompanies the Rambo self - <head>image</head> is useful in disarming trouble - makers and preventing further crime , as happened more than once during field - work . The view of senior management is that policemen need to combine the qualities of compassion and toughness and know when each is appropri  ate  ( FN 11/11/87 ,  pp. 78 )  ,  although in practice it is difficult to strike this fine balance .  Where it is seen by work colleagues to be getting out of kilter ,  informal controls can be used to restore equilibrium .

Once again the weight of television coverage had no effect on party credibility  ( though the nature of the coverage may have done so )  .

These rather artificial news items were very much the product of the final  election campaign .  In public perceptions the gap between Conservative unity and Labour unity narrowed sharply in the first few days of the campaign and again at the end ,  but actually increased very slightly in the third week .

They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,  partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro ,  who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,  was an open - minded historian of this sort .  He wrote enthusiastically about the later work of Arshile Gorky : Gorky 's atmosphere , veiling the hard opaque wall of the canvas , evokes a nocturnal void or the vague , unstable <head>image</head> - space of the day - dreaming mind .

A successful description of a self - portrait may not be difficult ,  but an illuminating interpretation may call on many references ,  especially other artists '  pictures of themselves .  What can be deduced from a self - portrait is often controversial ;  a critic is especially likely to read into a self - portrait some opinion held about the artist .  When , as in the cases of Rembrandt and Van Gogh , there is a whole series of pictures to choose from , books can be written on the self - <head>images</head> of one artist alone . This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's  writing ,  since it tempts the rash into speculation ,  while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons .  A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .

As in books on the philosophy of art ,  or aesthetics ,  many do not in fact contain any art criticism ,  in the sense of description ,  interpretation and judgement of individual works .  Their strengths are rather in clearing the ground of preconceived ideas about the arts ,  and putting new points of view .  When works of art are described only those aspects of an <head>image</head> important to the argument are included . It is in this arena that some of the fiercest intellectual fighting about art is taking place ,  though the contests range wider than the visual arts to politics and economics .  For example ,  Chadwick states :  There can be no simple category defined as feminist art history ,  since the effect of new ideas is that much recent scholarly writing has shifted attention from the categories art and artist to broader issues concerning ideologies of gender ,  sexuality ,  and power .

There are other ways of description ,  which may incidentally be employed by a critic ,  or can be useful to a reader as a check on the validity of a verbal description .  In chapter 4 ,  on monographs ,  there were some comments on the photography of art as a complement to criticism ;  there are some other issues about how accurate or misleading photographs can be .  Perhaps this is the more important in the late twentieth century now that this means of <head>image</head> - making is so familiar that some people actually imagine that a photograph shows the world as it is . In truth ,  the camera is a ruthless editor of visual information ;  this can be made plain by looking at a picture ,  say of the eighteenth century ,  and comparing it with a contemporary print ,  perhaps an aquatint ,  and a modern photograph .  The images carry different information .

Levi was an author who ,  without detriment to the other people who figure in his books ,  wrote all the time about himself ,  both in autobiographical and in fictional form .  The modes which he adopted were such as to  license  elisions and lacunae ,  to enable him to leave out bits of his life  a procedure  which would seem to be connected with his scepticism about what can be known about people by biographers .  In Moments of Reprieve he remarks : What the true <head>image</head> of each of us may be in the end is a meaningless question . In The Periodic Table  he mentions a woman dear to my heart who was murdered at Auschwitz :  but the book on Auschwitz does not discuss his relationship with her .  In The Wrench  he creates the rigger Faussone ,  the practical man whose cranes girdle the world and who keeps returning ,  a little heavy - footed ,  to the house in Turin where two old aunts fuss over his welfare :  Faussone was spoken of as my alter ego ,  and the book has to struggle to accommodate him as a second person ,  available for interview by Levi .

So ,  wrote Harsnet ,  there is continuity as well as discontinuity ,  but that does not mean ,  he wrote ,  that there exists what is called character ,  personality ,  character  ,  Goldberg wrote in the margin ,  personality  ,  as they seem to think ,  wrote Harsnet  ( and Goldberg went on typing )  ,  when they say you have such a generous character if you would only recognize it ,  or you have so much to offer ,  or it is not for myself I speak but for you ,  not for myself I mourn but for the waste of all that generosity ,  when they pour those words over you ,  character ,  generosity ,  warmth ,  looking sad ,  shedding tears ,  putting on a brave face ,  saying do n't pay any attention to me ,  or ,  it 's  nothing ,  forget it ,  I 'm crying for the waste ,  meaning waste if it 's  not directed towards them ,  but you have only to see what happens when one lets oneself be persuaded by that sort of thing ,  wrote Harsnet ,  you have only to see what happened to Hutchinson ,  MacMahon ,  Rollins and Goldberg .  Taken in by the <head>image</head> of yourself they present you with , wrote Harsnet , instead of waiting in patience for the beginning , instead of waiting and then beginning , though beginning , having begun , he wrote , is not everything , is far from everything . It is quite possible ,  he wrote ,  that it will lead nowhere ,  even when one has begun at the right time in the right spirit ,  or at least not at the wrong time ,  in the wrong spirit ,  with the wrong plans and having made the wrong preparations ,  with the wrong tools and the wrong principles ,  on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception .  Though it may well be ,  he wrote ,  that one actually achieves  more working with the wrong plans and in the wrong spirit ,  with the wrong tools and the wrong principles ,  on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception ,  it may well be ,  he wrote  ( and Goldberg typed )  ,  that one achieves more than working with the right plans and in the right spirit ,  with the right tools and the right principles ,  on the right surface and with the right conception ,  though right and wrong and more and less are relative concepts and what seems right at one moment to one person may seem wrong at the same moment to another Person or at another moment to the same person ,  and what seems more to one person at one moment may seem less to another person at the same moment or at another moment to the same person ,  right ,  wrong ,  more ,  less ,  relative concepts  ,  scribbled Goldberg ,  in the margin ,  panting slightly as he bent over his old Olivetti Portable ,  there is only the beginning ,  wrote Harsnet ,  or rather ,  there is only having begun ,  beginning  ,  scribbled Goldberg ,  aware now of the black stains on his hands left by the felt - tip pen ,  having begun  ,  there is only the feeling in the pit of the stomach or the feeling in the chest ,  wrote Harsnet ,  the feeling of sickness or the feeling of elation ,  those are not relative ,  he wrote ,  those are absolute .

In extreme cases anthropologists have found such a role impossible to live with ,  for the field situation was beyond their previous imaginations .  Castenada  ( 1970 )  ,  for example ,  found he was dealing with new events and totally new ways of understanding .  As a result , he necessarily developed a new self - <head>image</head> , and took on a new social personality in the process . In Castenada 's  case ,  he enters a world so different that he comes to accept reality itself as nothing but a social construct ,  with effects so devastating that ethnography becomes mysticism  ( Goward 1984 :  90 )  .  For Jeanne Favret - Saada  ( 1980 )  ,  who set out to study witchcraft in the French Bocage ,  the only means of moving in on the discourse she hoped to understand was to become part of it .

Just as the white - coated doctors in hospitals symbolize the clean and purifying nature of the healer ,  so the dark uniform of the police symbolizes not just the force identity ,  but also the presence of the avenger ,  who purifies through retribution rather than by cure .  It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force  police service which remains unresolved ,  on which I will say more later in relation to the role of women police officers .  The dark uniform we wore had a military cap with polished brim , and in our fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boots we presented an avenging <head>image</head> , clothed in the symbolic colour of death and darkness . Black is a light absorbent ,  non - reflective colour and most suitable for controllers who operate with a degree of social anonymity ,  upholding the rule of law and the abstractions of the legal system .  In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .

In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .  As Reiner  ( 1980 )  suggested ,  the riot gear in which the police are increasingly seen ,  with shields ,  visored helmets ,  knee - length boots ,  and flame - proof overalls ,  enhances their avenging appearance .  I suspect it is no accident the politics of the times seems to parallel the growing toughness of the police <head>image</head> , or that the police have taken on an increasing resemblance to the black - clothed enemies of goodness who sprinkle the popular science fantasy films such as Star Wars , Superman , and the like . In these mass cultural replays of the eternal dichotomy between good and evil ,  the use of highly symbolic black uniforms as an indicator of anonymous evil predominates .  Within the separate police forces ,  the nuances of uniform difference were always embroidered by real polises to produce symbolic boundaries from which to assess other uniform wearers .

Leonard Cohen is a man of medium height ,  five - feet ,  eight - inches  ( 173 cm )  ;  lean ,  with a rugged ,  world - weary face .  He looks like a man who should be heavier than he is ,  and one soon realises that an iron discipline keeps it that way .  He enjoys his food and wine , but disallows its enjoyment to distort the <head>image</head> which is important chiefly to himself , and then to his public . He is frequently described as having the stoop of an ageing crop - picker and the face of a curious little boy  which may have been true 30 years ago ,  but now belongs to the discard - tray with other caricatures :  caricatures ,  as Oscar Wilde observed ,  are compliments that mediocrity pays to genius .  Greying a little at the temples ,  Leonard unconsciously confirms why he is labelled one of Canada 's  sexiest men ,  a handsome and elegant man with dark eyes  ( they are said to be green ,  but that never showed in the light of Montreal ,  nor in its wintry sunshine )  .

Omitting his radical change of direction  ( i.e. of subject )  in his second year ,  it represents a demand of surrealist proportions ,  especially when one considers that alongside these he was reading French ,  Latin ,  Mathematics ,  Philosophy and History .  His task ,  one of unending and heady excitement ,  was now well and truly under way !  Little wonder that he sometimes gave the impression of inattentiveness in class ; he was inebriated in a world of letters , engulfed by an avalanche of ideas and <head>images</head> , forms and metres , essays and critiques : a fast - changing , provocative kaleidoscope which took his already well - stocked and fertile mind to fresh heights . Paradise it was not ;  but at least it resembled something like its antechamber .  He plunged himself into all this and more ,  avidly reading everything that came his way ;  especially poetry ,  and not least Spanish ,  Chinese and Japanese poets in translation ,  but chiefly that of Federico Garia Lorca and W.B. Yeats ,  of whom he mused ,  I loved Yeats ;  his connections  ( such an important code - word with Leonard !  )  his rhythms .

Layton described the four things which stand out in Leonard ,  which give him the confidence to work as he does ,  and promote his work :  The strong tradition of learning ;  the business entrepreneurship of his family ;  the broad philanthropy/charity which hall - marked it ;  and ,  lastly ,  the self - awareness that comes from being a Cohen  not understood as class - distinction ,  but from the high symbolism of the priest and his role .  This latter is particularly interesting .  It was raised by Dudek in somewhat different form when he said that Leonard always had an <head>image</head> of himself as a rabbi . We are talking of two very perceptive men  whose mtier is perception ;  and their recollection of Leonard at this young age ,  his late teenage years .  Layton put it somewhat differently when he added that the two great qualities a young writer has are his arrogance and inexperience ,  and on another occasion he picked out the twin characteristics of precocity and  independence .

As I shall explain in the next section ,  this earlier privileging of intellect was intimately connected with resistance to nominalism ,  and ,  in the seventeenth century nominalism triumphed .  The emphasis on the mentality and immateriality of sense experience was associated with the denial that there was anything special about intellect .  Even whilst developing the modern immaterialist notion of consciousness , the eighteenth - century empiricists and others were attacking the dignity of intellect and assimilating it to sensory activity by treating thoughts as mere <head>images</head> . As well as being a defence of mind ,  therefore ,  the early modern philosophy ,  through its nominalism ,  was also an attack on it .  And ,  in certain important respects ,  the general form of this attack is preserved in contemporary physicalist theories .

( See the discussions of these developments elsewhere in this book ,  particularly Chapters 4 and 7 .  )  And it has led to the introduction of new technologies for the direct investigation of the relationships between brain ,  behaviour and external events ,  the subject of the present chapter .  Most current procedures for recording the electrical activity of the brain , or producing radiographic <head>images</head> of the living human brain , or investigating the accuracy and timing of behaviour are dependent on computing capacity which was not available twenty years ago. But many of the techniques which computers are enabling us to exploit are not new .

So again ,  laboratory techniques were affording scientists a glimpse of their subjects '  mental lives .  The brain is not only an electrical machine ,  it also has a physical and chemical structure and these too are now being monitored in the living brain .  By using computers to integrate the information from a large number of different viewpoints round the skull , it is possible to visualize the appearance of a slice through the brain and build up a full three - dimensional <head>image</head> . The viewing medium can be X - rays ,  as in computerized tomographic  ( CT )  scans ;  magnetic resonance of atomic nuclei ,  as in nuclear magnetic resonance  ( NMR )  scans ;  or emission from radioactively labelled substances incorporated into the structure of nerve cells as in positron emission tomographic  ( PET )  scans .  These obviously have considerable clinical value for localizing and identifying areas of brain abnormality ,  but they also enable areas of activity in the normally functioning brain to be pictured .

Nevertheless ,  they have demonstrated activity in the visual areas during an imaging task ,  in the language areas during a verbal task and even ,  on one  -  occasion ,  in the higher visual areas of a schizophrenic patient who subsequently reported that he had been hallucinating .  Remarkable as these observations are ,  they are currently only confirming what was known already about localization within the brain .

Which is interesting because here the three of us are ,  thinking about what it means to belong somewhere ,  what it might mean to belong to this idea called theatre .

This is illustrated in Fig. 6 ,  showing typical mapping from the start of the four bit plane base addresses and the first line of pixels on the screen .  The main body of a bit image file consists of data bytes with bit mapping similar to figs 3 to 5 .  Bit <head>image</head> files normally have a fixed format header giving general information about the file and its format . One way to handle different bit mapping schemes is to include in the header details such as the number of bit planes ,  bits per pixel ,  pixels per scan line ,  and the number of scan lines .

Like video ram most graphics files support colour by ,  in effect ,  indexing into a look up table .  If a drawing description file refers to COLOUR 1 ,  the actual colour will be whatever colour 1 is set to .  Similarly , if a 16 colour bit <head>image</head> file format refers to red , green , blue and intensity planes , this will only be true of the default palette settings . However ,  it is quite common for graphics files to allow a colour table to be included ,  thus defining the palette .

Those stored in high level form are called outline or stroked fonts ,  and scale much more gracefully than bit image fonts ,  particularly to large sizes .  A pixel addressable printer can obviously reproduce a bit mapped image ,  and page description formats have developed to allow this .

Such a bit image blocks are not normally compressed ,  and anyone using graphics in a document is familiar with the time it takes to load the printer .

The flexibility of such printers makes desk top publishing possible ,  and can also internationalise computer printout with non Latin fonts ,  such as Japanese characters .

When wider bandwidth networking became available ,  the ability to move graphical information quickly around a network brought the cental multi user processor concept into the wimps era ,  and this has required clearly defined standards for the Graphical User Interface  ( GUI )  .  One such standard is the X Window system ,  developed by an industry collaboration group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .  It is largely based on the bit <head>image</head> approach , and assumes a resolution of around 100 pixels per inch , which could become a limitation in the future . However ,  X is very widely supported ,  and is associated with the Unix operating system and the move to open standards in the IT industry .  A competitor to X is Sun Microsystem 's  Network extensible Window System  ( NeWS )  which in some ways is technicalsuperior .

Eagleton 's  Althusserian phase of the mid - 1970s was strongly attacked by a Marxist academic ,  Kiernan Ryan ,  who has since taken issue with another Marxist ,  Alan Sinfield ,  on the extent to which the great literary works of the past can transcend the reactionary ideologies that produced them .  Sinfield believed that they were often irredeemably tainted by ideology ,  at best to be read only in historical terms ,  or subject to symptomatic readings ,  seeking the fractures and fissures in the mystified surface of the text that showed the true ideological conditions in which it was produced .  Against this , Ryan advanced the humanistic belief that the major canonical texts are not inherently reactionary , and that they contain implicit <head>images</head> and models of human freedom which transcend their immediate historical context and which later readers can respond to . This is an interestingly eclectic argument which recalls Gadamer on the fusion of horizons  ( the reader 's  and the text 's  )  ,  Marcuse on the utopian possibilities of high culture ,  and Sartre on the necessarily progressive implications of major literature .  Ryan represents a kind of Marxism that non - Marxists might do business with ,  in the sense that one can make a rational engagement with it .

The real problem is that the writers of such texts may make political difficulties within a department ,  or teach in ways difficult for students to understand .  Again ,  English departments can be unhelpful about participating in schemes for training academics how to teach ,  claiming that teaching literature is less easily defined and methodologized than teaching engineering or economics .  At a time when a good public <head>image</head> is essential for universities , English is unable to explain itself in ways immediately intelligible to the outsider , is notoriously riven with doubts and disagreements that prevent it from having a shared sense of purpose , and may at intervals erupt into crises that attract the wrong sort of publicity . It is time ,  it is thought ,  for English to organize itself in ways that make it more like a proper academic discipline ,  with clear procedures and goals .  The adjacent social sciences provide the model for a genuine professionalism and accountability .

It still seems to me that the acting critics of poesy are for the most part incapable of looking for more than one thing at a time ,  having got started about 1913  ( I mean a few of em got started about 1913 and a lot have started since )  to look for a certain plainness and directness of speech and simple order of words ;  and having about 1918 got started  looking for Mr Eliot 's  rather more fragile system  ( a system excellent for Mr Eliot but not very much use to any one else )  ,  they now limit their criticism to inquiring whether or no verse conforms to one or other of these manners ,  thereby often omitting to notice fundamentals ,  or qualities as important as verbal directness and even more important than snap .  The meaning of snap in relation to Eliot 's  rather more fragile system is at this date ,  I suppose ,  irrecoverable ;  but the general drift of these remarks is clear .  And this is not the only place in The Exile where Pound shows himself restive inside the <head>image</head> of himself that had been built up among initiates by his propaganda of fifteen years before , when he had taken over imagism and championed Ford Madox Ford 's ideas about a diction for poetry that should be plain and direct . At the end of this same issue of The Exile  there appears from Pound a page headed Desideria :  Quite simply :  I want a new civilization .

Ezra provided me with a standard ;  and gingered me into an attempt to train towards it .  Certainly it is the Pound of the London years ,  who had profited from Ford Madox Ford 's  pronouncements on diction ,  that Phyllis Bottome must have had in mind when she wrote :  The concrete <head>image</head> , unruffled by an adjective , was a thing Ezra would willingly have died for . Rhetoric  was a thing he would gladly have murdered ;  and he had already carried out his theory of honest thinking at the expense of considerable financial and perhaps emotional sacrifices .

In fact the original eighteen poems of the Hardy sequence ,   ( in the Collected Poems  of 1919 ,  he damagingly extended it by three extra pieces )  tell a story of the poet 's  pilgrimage to his and Emma 's  early haunts ,  matching the stages of the journey there and back to specific stages of Aeneas 's  journey ,  in Aeneid  6 ,  to the abode of the blest .  It thus represents ,  on the part of the supposedly non - modernist Hardy ,  a stratagem often taken to be definitively modernist :  the use of an ancient fable to structure and resonate with a twentieth - century narrative ,  as the Odyssey  structures and resonates with James Joyce 's  Ulysses  .  Yet so firmly established is the <head>image</head> of Hardy as a rustic provincial that Virgil rates not a single entry in the index to J.O . Bailey 's  700 - page Poetry of  Thomas Hardy ,  A Handbook and Commentary  ,   ( University of North Carolina ,  Chapel Hill ,  1970 )  .  Hardy undoubtedly read Virgil in the original ;  yet we know that long before he taught himself Latin his remarkable mother gave him  ( on his eighth birthday )  a copy of Dryden 's  translation of the Aeneid  .

His mocking of his opponent ,  Lord Home ,  served not only to challenge the competence of the Establishment but equally to advertise the superior competence of Harold Wilson .

He tagged the Tories with a grouse moor <head>image</head> and mocked Home for his matchbox economics .

By the end of this week we shall know what the Labour Party no longer stands for ,  such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and full - scale nationalisation ;  but what ,  in essence ,  does it stand for ?  If it did not exist ,  would anyone trouble to invent it at a time when ,  from the Atlantic to the Urals ,  socialism in all its manifestations is losing the argument to liberal capitalism ?  For we should not become too carried away by Labour 's changed face and tone of voice , nor too dazzled by the Peter Mandelson <head>image</head> - conjuring . The party may have put on a collar and tie but it is still the Labour Party ,  prone to its old reflexes  ( as it reminded us yesterday on defence spending )  ,  prisoner still of its anachronistic structure ,  its mind set in 100 years of working -  class history .

Ministers will also be seeking to lift sagging Tory morale ,  by offering assurances on a range of issues ,  which promise to make this one of the most difficult annual conferences the party leadership has faced since Margaret Thatcher came to office .

Party leaders aim to lift sagging morale by attacking Labour 's  successful conference week as a public relations exercise masterminded by Peter Mandelson ,  the party 's  director of campaigns and communications .  Ministers will insist that ,  despite the image management ,  the party remains dominated by the left .  Nicholas Ridley , Secretary of State for Trade and Industry , will open the attack on Neil Kinnock , the Labour leader today with a warning that the party could revert to its left - wing <head>image</head> , if it were elected . Kenneth Clarke ,  Secretary of State for Health ,  will offer reassurances on the changes to the National Health Service ,  with a strong defence of the policies for allowing hospitals to opt out ,  establishing an internal market and giving GPs practice budgets .  Michael Heseltine ,  the former Secretary of State for Defence ,  is the voters '  favourite to succeed Mrs Thatcher ,  according to an opinion poll published in The Daily Telegraph today .

Toshack has wasted no time in putting his stamp on the side ,  moving the West German midfielder Bernd Schuster to libero ,  Michel from the right flank to central midfield ,  and giving the striker Emilio Butragueno a slightly withdrawn role .  And those with their ears to the dressing - room wall have yet to report rumbles .  Toshack has taken pains to play down the hard - man <head>image</head> he brought from San Sebastian , swearing that the extra training ordered after the poor performance at Castellon was not a punishment . While Real are unbeaten ,  the relative honeymoon will continue for a man whom the late Bill Shankly ,  with characteristic caution ,  once said was destined to become the top manager in the game .  Toshack 's  admiration for Shankly ,  who signed him for Liverpool from Cardiff in 1970 ,  is unquestionably deep :  still the overwhelming influence on his career .

From PETER PRINGLE in Washington AS THE post - mortem into the failed coup in Panama continued yesterday ,  it emerged that President Bush had approved an order to the US commander in the Canal Zone to remove General Manuel Noriega using covert forces ,  but the coup fizzled out before the order could be executed .  The debate is now focused on what the United States will do next time , if anything , to fulfil its declared policy of getting rid of General Noriega and avoid an <head>image</head> of timidity and indecisiveness when the chance comes . In a television interview ,  James Baker ,  the Secretary of State ,  said the Panama commander ,  General Maxwell Thurman ,  had been sent an order last Tuesday morning ,  the day of the coup ,  requiring him to seize General Noriega if there were an opportunity to do so without risking American life and without open military involvement ,  then he was free to go ahead .  The order was ,  in effect ,  an authorisation to plan a seizure ,  not to carry it out .

The supernatural is as numbed as the natural :  equipped with microphone headsets and miniature televisions ,  the witches are played as suave technocrats ,  moving among humanity with invisible malice ,  sometimes doubling as murderers .  Only in the language  spoken with clarity throughout ,  especially by Simon Tyrrell as Macbeth ,  and Peter Granger - Taylor as Ross  does any slight consolation remain .  Across ashen , unredeemable scenes , Shakespeare 's words resound with redoubled force and humanity ; they sound almost ironic , in their fruitless reaching towards the <head>images</head> and emotions which have drained away from a soulless , monochrome universe . There are times when this universe seems excessively ,  even arbitrarily ,  bleak .

It is stories like these which help to protect Easton 's  policemen and women from the loss of morale which Manning claims is an inevitable result of the contradiction between the image the police have of themselves and their work and the low - key nature of practical policing  ( Manning 1977 :  349 ;  also see Holdaway 1983 ,  1988 ,  who makes a similar point )  .  The conceptualizations of police work that are found in Easton not only fit what is known of police forces elsewhere ,  they parallel the portrayal of policing in the wider culture .  The <head>image</head> of policing gleaned from police programmes on British and American television and in films is very much how Easton 's police see themselves , as others have commented with respect to police forces elsewhere ( Holdaway 1983 : 147 ; Hurd 1979 ; Klockars 1983 ; Morris and Heal 1981 ; Tuska 1979 ) . The popularity of these programmes among the section police in Easton is both cause and effect of the evaluations they make of their work .  The excitement ,  suspense ,  and danger which seems the lot of the police on celluloid feeds into the definitions many of Easton 's  section police give to their work experience ,  and the supposed similarity of this experience leads them to see police films and television programmes as an accurate portrayal ,  to be watched avidly because of this shared world .

Those policemen who have racist views are faced with problems when the hero on celluloid is black ,  but when discussing such an instance ,  one policeman expressed his dislike for blacks but still found the film brilliant  ( FN 9/10/87 ,  p. 57 )  .  More importantly ,  this imagery affects the demeanour of these macho men when dealing with the public .  Sensitivity to public relations is not a quality which accompanies the Rambo self - <head>image</head> , and sergeants sometimes avoid placing the policemen who live out this imagery in situations where their insensitivity can damage public perceptions of the police . Various studies have shown that the public evaluate the police in terms of the attitude the police show them when they are victims in need of police help  ( for example ,  Jones 1983 ;  Maguire 1982 ;  Shapland 1982 ;  Southgate and Ekblom 1984 )  .  It is not always possible for low - ranking officers to anticipate the situations which Action Men need to avoid ,  and some instances were observed where the aggressive manner of the policeman acted as a form of amplification of deviance  ( Young 1971 )  ,  transforming a minor situation into big crime .

Moving on loitering youths is a policing situation ripe for such amplification ,  as other research has shown  ( Southgate and Ekblom 1986 :  35 ,  37 ;  Young 1971 )  ,  and there were several occasions when policemen for whom this imagery is very important over - reacted to the presence of young people on street corners and were aggressive in the way they moved them on .  On one occasion the aggression was returned ,  resulting in the person being brought into the station and charged .  Of course , there are other situations when the toughness that accompanies the Rambo self - <head>image</head> is useful in disarming trouble - makers and preventing further crime , as happened more than once during field - work . The view of senior management is that policemen need to combine the qualities of compassion and toughness and know when each is appropri  ate  ( FN 11/11/87 ,  pp. 78 )  ,  although in practice it is difficult to strike this fine balance .

Public perceptions of party unity increased between our Pre - Campaign Wave and the start of the final campaign .  During the pre - campaign week we recorded no items on television news which positively projected the <head>image</head> of party unity . These rather artificial news items were very much the product of the final  election campaign .  In public perceptions the gap between Conservative unity and Labour unity narrowed sharply in the first few days of the campaign and again at the end ,  but actually increased very slightly in the third week .
