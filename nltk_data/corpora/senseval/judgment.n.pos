The period between 1939 to 1949 has been called the most productive and significant period in Canadian letters to date ,  which matches the 10 Lost Years of the post - Depression period exactly .  Leonard was fortunate to come to it when he did ,  for he was able to enter into the fruits and the confidence born of it ,  as well as classical English literature .  If , under Hugh MacLennan , he was able to form his <head>judgment</head> and turn his phrases under the eye of a skilful novelist , in Louis Dudek 's adroit hands he was able to fashion and test his poetic acumen to the full ; both were to be of absorbing interest to him. Moreover ,  Dudek 's  scholarship was of a more penetrating kind than anything under which Leonard had yet sat ,  or was to sit ,  as became that of a Doctor of Letters from Columbia University .  He was a highly reputable and incisive critic of art and culture as well as literature ;  a bilinguist of note ,  and  more important than all those !   a poet of rare accomplishment ;  a poet 's  poet .

The days were truly apocalyptic ;  sadly ,  many of the commentators and reviewers ,  the would - be art leaders ,  were merely apoplectic ;  not least in fastening on to his overt sexuality ,  their criticisms of him shielding their own neuroses .  The rabbis had a saying :  Where there is too much ,  there is something missing .  The excess to which some have pointed may well disclose the absence of something crucial , but for that we must defer <head>judgment</head> . In the meantime we may note that ,  right or wrong ,  balanced or not ,  Leonard spoke from the heart  as did the prophets of old ;  the sell - out qualities of the book demonstrated the need ,  as well as his astuteness in compiling his selection .  He was proving himself to be not only an accurate witness to the times ,  but a respected one ,  too .

LORD JUSTICE BALCOMBE said that the point of substance in the case was whether the mother 's  consent was unreasonably withheld .  The leading authority was the House of Lords case of Re W  ( 1971 )  AC 682 where it was held that when dealing with the question of withholding consent ,  the test was reasonableness ,  not culpability or indifference ,  and although the child 's  welfare per se was not the test ,  it was relevant .  Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone , LC , said that the question was whether a parental veto came within the band of possible reasonable decisions and not whether it was right or mistaken and that there was a band of decisions within which the court should seek to replace the individual 's <head>judgment</head> with his own . Those tests presented the court with a difficulty .  It was very difficult for a court to say what a reasonable mother would have done in circumstances which were almost hypothetical .

The appellant was convicted and now appealed .  Judith Nutt  ( Registrar of Criminal Appeals )  for the appellant ;  Hugh Allardyce  ( CPS ,  Croydon )  for the Crown .  MR JUSTICE SAVILLE , giving the <head>judgment</head> of the court , said the appellant did not suggest that the co - defendant 's committing of an act of gross indecency with the appellant was not relevant to the question whether , at the same time and place , the appellant was committing a like act with the co - defendant . The appellant appealed on the ground that the co - defendant 's  plea of guilty should have been excluded by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion under section 78 ( 1 )  of the 1984 Act .  Mrs Nutt submitted that it would be difficult ,  if not impossible ,  for the appellant to try and set about to prove that the co - defendant had not committed an act of gross indecency with him ,  that he was in effect deprived of any opportunity of cross - examining or otherwise challenging the co - defendant and that to admit the evidence would be simply to render the proceedings against the appellant wholly unfair .

Paragraph 5 referred simply to enforcement of a <head>judgment</head> or order against a person who , under the rule , was bound by it . It did not purport to enlarge the class of persons who might enforce the judgment or order and there was no basis for attributing any such intention or effect .

The Declaration was  not surprisingly  unaccompanied by any mechanism for the enforcement of the rights which it declared .  In that respect it differed from the European Convention of Human Rights ,  to which the United Kingdom adhered in November 1950 under the auspices of the Council of Europe and which came into force in September 1953 .  The Convention established a European Court of Human Rights , to which the signatory states accorded supranational powers , and before which at this moment Britain awaits <head>judgment</head> in respect of acts committed in Northern Ireland in 1971 . Significantly ,  there is no provision  ( yet )  in the European Convention corresponding to Article 25 of the UN Declaration .  However it would be unwise to conclude that ,  just because it has no enforcement mechanism ,  the Universal Declaration is as harmless as it is futile .

And now we have come up before the beak for a second wigging ,  because on the application of  one of our own citizens we are accused of degrading treatment or punishment inflicted in the Isle of Man .

There is no similarity between this and international arbitration , where a state voluntarily agrees in a particular case to accept the <head>judgment</head> of a tribunal , as two individuals might freely agree to accept the adjudication of an arbitrator . International arbitration is no more a transfer of sovereignty than private arbitration is an ousting of the jurisdiction of the courts .  The European Convention is different in kind ,  and the British signatories of it ,  worthy predecessors to the signatories of the Treaty of Brussels in 1972 ,  put an end to a period of more than four centuries during which no causes have been carried out of this realm .

The consequences strike at the right of the people of this country to live under the laws made and altered by their representatives in Parliament .

In order to arrive at its findings , the European Commission does what no court in this country can do , namely sit in <head>judgment</head> upon the policy and justification of an Act of Parliament . What is more ,  and equally incompatible with our conception of parliamentary democracy ,  the judicial interpretation of the terms of such a document as the Convention is not susceptible to statutory control or modification .  In the system to which the European Convention belongs ,  the judiciary are the legislators ,  and their powers as such are the more sweeping because of the necessarily vague and general terms in which the socalled human rights are defined .

His premonition proved to be well founded .  The expectation that God would reward the righteous in this world ran parallel to the less attractive expectation that He would punish the unrighteous .  Calvinists , for whom no event could be fortuitous , were especially prone to make <head>judgments</head> that divine providence was supposed to bring to fruition before their eyes . It is recorded of a Bishop ,  who was a strong Sabbatarian and disapproved of Sunday trains ,  that he was puzzled by statistics showing that train accidents were no more frequent on Sundays than on weekdays .  Readers of the great Victorian novelists rejoiced to find in the final chapters how summarily justice was meted out to the villains ;  some were perplexed that the Almighty often failed to knot up loose ends equally satisfactorily .

There are powerful arguments in favour of saying that there are other killings where an intent to kill cannot be established ,  and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killings .  Of course ,  one cannot be adamant about whether they merit the label murder ,  because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter ,  which is not susceptible of any precise resolution .  It is hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller or larger ( unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows ) ; it is a question of social <head>judgment</head> . Let us briefly consider some of the possibilities .  The fault element for many serious offences is intent or recklessness :  why should this not suffice for murder ?

At the Essex Forest Eyre of 1277 it was presented that Alexander Not of Havering had entered the Abbess of Barking 's  wood and felled an oak .  He had been discovered by the abbess 's  steward ,  Richard of Bernstead ,  who ,  when he resisted attachment ,  seized and bound him ,  took him to Barking ,  imprisoned him for three days and afterwards delivered him to the forester and the verderer .  The <head>judgment</head> of the court was that because Richard was not a sworn forester , he was liable to amercement . In the execution of their duties the foresters often had to contend with armed bands of desperate men ;  in many cases they were beaten and even killed while attempting to arrest Forest offenders .  In 1351 Edward III granted John the woodward of Raskelf a pension of 3d .  a day for good service and especially because his eyes were torn out and his tongue and his fingers cut off by malefactors in the Forest of Galtres in the time when he was one of the King 's  foresters there .

The Court ruled that :  as the said John was elected verderer by the knights and others of the county of Stafford , in full county court , faithfully to serve the King in his office of verderer , therefore <head>judgment</head> shall be pronounced on them on that account . Verderers and agisters were on occasion ,  however ,  appointed directly by the king or by the Justice of the Forest ;  at other times the warden of the forest was ordered to see that vacancies were filled .  During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the verderers ,  regarders and agisters usually held office for life ,  provided that they discharged their duties faithfully and well ,  but in the fifteenth century the authority of the verderer ,  like that of the coroner ,  was brought to an end by the death of the king ,  and the sheriffs were ordered to hold new elections .

If the verderers  ( or their heirs ,  if the verderers had died in the mean time )  failed to present their rolls to the judges on the first day of the Forest Eyre ,  or if their rolls were deficient in any material particular ,  they were liable to amercement .  At the Huntingdonshire Forest Eyre of 1255 the foresters and verderers presented a clerk and his page for a trespass against the venison .  The <head>judgment</head> of the court was that because the verderers and the Steward of the Forest made no mention in their rolls of the name of the said page ,  nor of his delivery ,  nor of his escape ,  and the business of the King so far as it relates to the said boy is entirely undone ,  therefore they are in mercy .  But the verderers were finally acquitted ,

The local gentry and others were presented for taking the deer ,  which they had probably been accustomed to do for generations with little interference .

To give <head>judgment</head> upon these presentments , the ancient machinery of the Forest Eyre was once more set in motion after a long period of general disuse . Between 1488 and 1490 eyres were held in the Berkshire and Surrey divisions of Windsor Forest ,  in Hampshire ,  Wiltshire ,  Northamptonshire ,  Essex ,  Buckinghamshire and Huntingdonshire .  The court rolls show that the Forest law had been generally disregarded ,  and that the king 's  deer had been hunted and the forest timber felled on a large scale .

Interest rates would have to be higher and there is a risk that a Labour government facing difficult choices would be tempted to devalue sterling ,  as feared by financial markets .

The report makes no <head>judgment</head> on Labour 's tax plans . However ,  it argues that VAT increases will be required whichever party is in power if public borrowing is to be reduced .  Implicit in this analysis is the view that Labour would have little scope for raising additional revenue by further increases in income tax directed at the better - off .

It was the greatest struggle despite all these economy measures to scrape together the VAT payable by July 31 ,  said the judgment .  The result was there was very little money left in the kitty to meet the bill but even so the payment was just two weeks late .  I have no doubt that it was this misfortune that caused the appellant 's financial difficulties , one huge bad debt and the loss of regular valuable business , said the <head>judgment</head> . Mr Anderson told the tribunal he could not apply for bad debt relief until 12 months after the debt had arisen while Customs had penalised him for paying the VAT a mere 16 days late .  He says :  I feel I have established a precedent for arguing that if there is a genuine reason why one has n't got the cash to pay the tax the surcharge should be waived .

But Dillon LJ said :   if the LEA does not itself decide the special educational provision that should be made for the child ,  but leaves that to be decided by the school ,  with remedial classes and other facilities as may be available in the school ,  the LEA is not itself determining the special educational provision for the child within the meaning in section 7 ( 1 )  ;  consequently ,  the LEA is not obliged to make and maintain a statement .  A decision to leave what is to be done for a particular child to the school is not itself , in my <head>judgment</head> , a determination of the special educational provision for the child which would necessitate the making of a statement .

He was a highly reputable and incisive critic of art and culture as well as literature ;  a bilinguist of note ,  and  more important than all those !   a poet of rare accomplishment ;  a poet 's  poet .

LORD JUSTICE BALCOMBE said that the point of substance in the case was whether the mother 's  consent was unreasonably withheld .  The leading authority was the House of Lords case of Re W  ( 1971 )  AC 682 where it was held that when dealing with the question of withholding consent ,  the test was reasonableness ,  not culpability or indifference ,  and although the child 's  welfare per se was not the test ,  it was relevant .  Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone , LC , said that the question was whether a parental veto came within the band of possible reasonable decisions and not whether it was right or mistaken and that there was a band of decisions within which the court should seek to replace the individual 's <head>judgment</head> with his own . Those tests presented the court with a difficulty .  It was very difficult for a court to say what a reasonable mother would have done in circumstances which were almost hypothetical .

The appellant was convicted and now appealed .  Judith Nutt  ( Registrar of Criminal Appeals )  for the appellant ;  Hugh Allardyce  ( CPS ,  Croydon )  for the Crown .  MR JUSTICE SAVILLE , giving the <head>judgment</head> of the court , said the appellant did not suggest that the co - defendant 's committing of an act of gross indecency with the appellant was not relevant to the question whether , at the same time and place , the appellant was committing a like act with the co - defendant . The appellant appealed on the ground that the co - defendant 's  plea of guilty should have been excluded by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion under section 78 ( 1 )  of the 1984 Act .  Mrs Nutt submitted that it would be difficult ,  if not impossible ,  for the appellant to try and set about to prove that the co - defendant had not committed an act of gross indecency with him ,  that he was in effect deprived of any opportunity of cross - examining or otherwise challenging the co - defendant and that to admit the evidence would be simply to render the proceedings against the appellant wholly unfair .

The Declaration was  not surprisingly  unaccompanied by any mechanism for the enforcement of the rights which it declared .  In that respect it differed from the European Convention of Human Rights ,  to which the United Kingdom adhered in November 1950 under the auspices of the Council of Europe and which came into force in September 1953 .  The Convention established a European Court of Human Rights , to which the signatory states accorded supranational powers , and before which at this moment Britain awaits <head>judgment</head> in respect of acts committed in Northern Ireland in 1971 . Significantly ,  there is no provision  ( yet )  in the European Convention corresponding to Article 25 of the UN Declaration .  However it would be unwise to conclude that ,  just because it has no enforcement mechanism ,  the Universal Declaration is as harmless as it is futile .

There is no similarity between this and international arbitration , where a state voluntarily agrees in a particular case to accept the <head>judgment</head> of a tribunal , as two individuals might freely agree to accept the adjudication of an arbitrator . International arbitration is no more a transfer of sovereignty than private arbitration is an ousting of the jurisdiction of the courts .  The European Convention is different in kind ,  and the British signatories of it ,  worthy predecessors to the signatories of the Treaty of Brussels in 1972 ,  put an end to a period of more than four centuries during which no causes have been carried out of this realm .

The consequences strike at the right of the people of this country to live under the laws made and altered by their representatives in Parliament .

In order to arrive at its findings , the European Commission does what no court in this country can do , namely sit in <head>judgment</head> upon the policy and justification of an Act of Parliament . What is more ,  and equally incompatible with our conception of parliamentary democracy ,  the judicial interpretation of the terms of such a document as the Convention is not susceptible to statutory control or modification .  In the system to which the European Convention belongs ,  the judiciary are the legislators ,  and their powers as such are the more sweeping because of the necessarily vague and general terms in which the socalled human rights are defined .

ADECISION on whether a trainee journalist should be jailed for contempt of court was yesterday adjourned until next month pending a hearing in the House of Lords .  Mr Justice Hoffman said in the High Court that he had decided to suspend judgment until he knew how soon the House of Lords was likely to hear an appeal against an order forcing Mr William Goodwin ,  aged 23 ,  who works on the Engineer magazine ,  to reveal confidential information .

Earlier yesterday ,  the Court of Appeal refused an application by Mr Goodwin 's  employers ,  the publishers Morgan Grampian ,  to revoke the order forcing him to hand over notes containing confidential financial information concerning a company ,  which cannot be named for legal reasons .  The company alleges that the information came from a stolen document ,  and wants to take action against the source .

There are powerful arguments in favour of saying that there are other killings where an intent to kill cannot be established ,  and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killings .  Of course ,  one cannot be adamant about whether they merit the label murder ,  because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter ,  which is not susceptible of any precise resolution .  It is hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller or larger ( unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows ) ; it is a question of social <head>judgment</head> .

I should do something now , because perhaps it was for want of normal company that Eleanor Thorne lay until her mind turned the corner into madness and final decay , I should go out , I should not allow myself to brood , to carry out my sister 's peculiar whims and defer to the <head>judgments</head> she passes upon me . I should visit Alida ,  who is now also alone ,  and Dorothea ,  for she has her friend whose name I cannot remember ,  and that is yet another person for me to talk to ,  make friends with .  I should not run home and stay here in fear ,  for my sister cannot harm me .

At the Essex Forest Eyre of 1277 it was presented that Alexander Not of Havering had entered the Abbess of Barking 's  wood and felled an oak .  He had been discovered by the abbess 's  steward ,  Richard of Bernstead ,  who ,  when he resisted attachment ,  seized and bound him ,  took him to Barking ,  imprisoned him for three days and afterwards delivered him to the forester and the verderer .  The <head>judgment</head> of the court was that because Richard was not a sworn forester , he was liable to amercement . In the execution of their duties the foresters often had to contend with armed bands of desperate men ;  in many cases they were beaten and even killed while attempting to arrest Forest offenders .  In 1351 Edward III granted John the woodward of Raskelf a pension of 3d .  a day for good service and especially because his eyes were torn out and his tongue and his fingers cut off by malefactors in the Forest of Galtres in the time when he was one of the King 's  foresters there .

The Court ruled that :  as the said John was elected verderer by the knights and others of the county of Stafford , in full county court , faithfully to serve the King in his office of verderer , therefore <head>judgment</head> shall be pronounced on them on that account . Verderers and agisters were on occasion ,  however ,  appointed directly by the king or by the Justice of the Forest ;  at other times the warden of the forest was ordered to see that vacancies were filled .  During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the verderers ,  regarders and agisters usually held office for life ,  provided that they discharged their duties faithfully and well ,  but in the fifteenth century the authority of the verderer ,  like that of the coroner ,  was brought to an end by the death of the king ,  and the sheriffs were ordered to hold new elections .

If the verderers  ( or their heirs ,  if the verderers had died in the mean time )  failed to present their rolls to the judges on the first day of the Forest Eyre ,  or if their rolls were deficient in any material particular ,  they were liable to amercement .  At the Huntingdonshire Forest Eyre of 1255 the foresters and verderers presented a clerk and his page for a trespass against the venison .  The <head>judgment</head> of the court was that because the verderers and the Steward of the Forest made no mention in their rolls of the name of the said page ,  nor of his delivery ,  nor of his escape ,  and the business of the King so far as it relates to the said boy is entirely undone ,  therefore they are in mercy .  But the verderers were finally acquitted ,

The local gentry and others were presented for taking the deer ,  which they had probably been accustomed to do for generations with little interference .  Other presentments concerned the unwarranted felling of trees and cutting of branches in the forest coppices ,  and the overburdening of the forest pastures with unauthorized numbers of cattle ,  sheep and pigs .  To give <head>judgment</head> upon these presentments , the ancient machinery of the Forest Eyre was once more set in motion after a long period of general disuse . Between 1488 and 1490 eyres were held in the Berkshire and Surrey divisions of Windsor Forest ,  in Hampshire ,  Wiltshire ,  Northamptonshire ,  Essex ,  Buckinghamshire and Huntingdonshire .  The court rolls show that the Forest law had been generally disregarded ,  and that the king 's  deer had been hunted and the forest timber felled on a large scale .

Interest rates would have to be higher and there is a risk that a Labour government facing difficult choices would be tempted to devalue sterling ,  as feared by financial markets .  Despite Labour 's  plans to raise taxes by 6.8 billion in a full year ,  the analysis says it would be unable to fund its election spending promises beyond initial moves to raise pensions and child benefit and a modest recovery programme .  The report makes no <head>judgment</head> on Labour 's tax plans . However ,  it argues that VAT increases will be required whichever party is in power if public borrowing is to be reduced .  Implicit in this analysis is the view that Labour would have little scope for raising additional revenue by further increases in income tax directed at the better - off .

It was the greatest struggle despite all these economy measures to scrape together the VAT payable by July 31 ,  said the judgment .  The result was there was very little money left in the kitty to meet the bill but even so the payment was just two weeks late .  I have no doubt that it was this misfortune that caused the appellant 's financial difficulties , one huge bad debt and the loss of regular valuable business , said the <head>judgment</head> . Mr Anderson told the tribunal he could not apply for bad debt relief until 12 months after the debt had arisen while Customs had penalised him for paying the VAT a mere 16 days late .  He says :  I feel I have established a precedent for arguing that if there is a genuine reason why one has n't got the cash to pay the tax the surcharge should be waived .

Hemlock water - dropwort  (  Oenanthe crocata  )  ,  however ,  has a Gaelic name that suggests another kind of imagery :   bog ,  meaning gentle deceit .

Many Christians started to worry that Christian faith was being made to rest upon the merely provisional conclusions of historians .

The beliefs of Christians could not , it was said , rest upon historical <head>judgments</head> , because these beliefs as truths of reason would then depend upon the truths of history , which were only accidental ( in other words , they might not be the case ) .

But Dillon LJ said :   if the LEA does not itself decide the special educational provision that should be made for the child ,  but leaves that to be decided by the school ,  with remedial classes and other facilities as may be available in the school ,  the LEA is not itself determining the special educational provision for the child within the meaning in section 7 ( 1 )  ;  consequently ,  the LEA is not obliged to make and maintain a statement .  A decision to leave what is to be done for a particular child to the school is not itself , in my <head>judgment</head> , a determination of the special educational provision for the child which would necessitate the making of a statement . The Lashford  case thus demonstrates the extent of LEA discretion under the 1981 Act .

Some of the other foundation subjects ,  such as art or PE ,  will have far less detailed ATs and PS .
