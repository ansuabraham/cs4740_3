The appeal followed numerous reports that Iraqi Government forces were committing these and other human rights violations following the recapture of cities and town in the northern Kurdish and southern Shi'a areas of the country .

In its appeal AI also <head>expressed</head> dismay at reports that Iraqi Kurds who returned to Arbil in northern Iraq following a government announcement of an amnesty for Kurds on 5 April were arbitrarily arrested , summarily executed or subjected to forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment . AI also sent urgent appeals to the governments of the United States ,  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in April ,  urging them to ensure that Iraqi refugees then under the control of United States - led coalition forces were guaranteed effective and durable protection against human rights violations by Iraqi Government forces .  AI stated that it strongly feared that the refugee population would be at risk of certain torture ,  disappearance or execution if returned to Iraqi Government control .

Venturi was a university teacher ,  son of a famous father ,  Adolpho Venturi ,  who had made a substantial contribution to the publication of documents of Italian art .  Venturi 's  survey started with classical times ,  the uncertainties of writing by Xenocrates ,  lists of lost works such as the treatise by Apelles ,  and settled down to comment on  two fundamental categories of criticism ,  the lives of artists ,  and the critic 's  encounter with the work of art .  For the latter he quoted a sentence by Lucian , the second - century Greek rhetorician : A work of art requires an intelligent spectator who must go beyond the pleasure of the eyes to <head>express</head> a judgement and to argue the reasons for what he sees . For Venturi ,  an important development in art criticism came in the eighteenth century which saw the foundation of aesthetics and the rise of philosophies for which art was an indispensable ingredient .  Writing as he was in the 1930s ,  he expressed his pleasure at the extensive documentation and reference material available to the student of art ,  instancing the growth of libraries and art historical teaching .

By modernity I mean the ephemeral ,  the fugitive ,  the contingent ,  the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the immutable .  Modernity also had other manifestations .

The real benefit of reading Baudelaire himself on the art of his contemporaries is the chance of recovering some of the excitement the poet felt .  It is an additional pleasure to recognise his prophetic power of divining where the best art was to be found .

This is a generic something :  I am speaking here of a literary practice long and widely and variously undertaken ,  in relation to which Roth is both critic and executant .  But it should also be said that some elements of this description of mine could be taken to characterise the activity ,  sometimes ominous enough in its human implications ,  of all imaginative writers ,  however remote they may be from the dualistic confederacy .  The caveats <head>expressed</head> in The Counterlife apply to all occasions when , in whatever genre or style , autobiography imposes itself upon , overwrites , the world . By Roth ,  as by his predecessors in the dualistic art ,  this definition has been correlated with breakdown ,  madness ,  though ,  as we have seen ,  Zuckerman seeks to exert a counterclaim in his letter to Maria .  And it has evolved in contrast with character  that other ,  earlier product of the literary imagination   and with purpose and achievement .

Policing issues are never long out of the headlines  ( Chibnall 1977 )  ,  and this media obsession has been transmitted into a  wealth of analyses of policing  which have mostly been carried out by outside observers .  Indeed insider accounts have largely consisted of bland reminiscences in the style of my greatest arrests and cases and it has been left to investigative journalism to redress some unacceptable police activity ,  by calling attention to the limits and abuses of police authority ,  power ,  and accountability .  Concern also continues to be <head>expressed</head> in some quarters over the increasingly authoritarian attitudes and methodology which surrounds some police practices and there is a commensurate fear about the growth in policing and the exercise of their extensive powers , which look set to become increasingly centralized and wieldy . Thompson  ( 1980 )  has warned of the potential danger of a strong police autocracy ,  conscious ,  no doubt ,  of the slim line which exists between the democratic use of power and its subversion by a more centralized totalitarianism .  And the forty - three forces in England and Wales now contain some formidable units ,  amalgamated out of the small borough ,  city ,  and county forces of the pre - 1960s ,  many of which were prone to the whims of corrupt local politicians  ( Simey 1988 )  .

Both were old enough to feel keenly the savage blow ,  one from which Leonard suffered in particular ,  albeit outwardly in guarded silence :  The deeper the sorrow ,  the less tongue it has ,  said the rabbis .  His mother sought to protect him from the usual customs such as summoning the relatives to his father 's  bedside ,  but the trauma was nevertheless very deeply felt .  Leonard recently referred to the memory of his father as a dark mass or mountain , of which , clearly , the details were too painful for the young boy to register or the adult to <head>express</head> . ( The image actually appeared in a somewhat different way in The Favourite Game  :  Concerning the bodies Breavman lost a man on the mountain ,  a reference to the cemetery on Mont Royale probably .  )  Loss ,  the most alienating of all experiences ;  the most unbelievable ,  and therefore the most easily forgotten  ( or repressible )  thing .

Leonard found this hard to stomach , and frequently <head>expressed</head> himself vehemently against his professor 's defences of the founder of Imagism ( which advocated free rhythm as well as concreteness of expression in poetry ) ; and against his disdainful , if teasing , comments of those who came from Westmount .

Even as the BeSHT delighted his listeners  with his pearls of wisdom ,  his stunning turns - of - phrase ,  his aphoristic acuity ,  so Leonard was learning his own ,  parallel metier ;  the butterfly was following him down the hill .  The negative side of all this was ben Eliezer 's  polemics against straight - faced ,  over - serious rabbinism ;  against those whose understanding of God 's  nature was austere and unfatherly ;  those who ,  while seeking to elevate the Most High ,  merely put him out of touch with his own children ;  debarred them from his welcoming presence by a system or learning that became frivolous in its intensity :  not that its perpetrators could be frivolous :  black was their colour ,  even as severity was their posture  as becomes the frozen - in - soul .  For such , God only frowns on the world , and stirs it to judgment ; the butterfly cannot break loose into flight ; it merely expires , as Leonard <head>expressed</head> it , ending its life in three flag - swept days. It was hard for Satan alone to mislead the whole world ,  declared the grandson of the BeSHT ,  Nachman of Bratislava ,  in one of his more caustic diatribes ,  so he appointed rabbis in different locations .  And not only rabbis ,  one might add ,  but priests and nuns ,  monks ,  ministers and bishops !

At its simplest ,  associationism is the theory that a mental content has the meaning it does because of the things that tend to follow ,  or precede ,  it into the mind .  So the word red means red because thought of the word tends to be succeeded by a mental image of the colour ,  or vice versa  .  This can be <head>expressed</head> in Hume 's terms of the tendency of the mind to pass from one to the other , but one must be careful how one interprets such a tendency . It is tempting to think of it as a felt  tendency ,  so that one is somehow aware of where the mind is going .  This will not do ,  for it is no different from saying that when one experiences red one thinks or conceives of the colour ,  whereas the point of the theory was to explain what such thinking ,  or conceiving ,  is .

And there has been a remarkable interchange of ideas between computational theorists and neuroscientists ,  in which attempts to create computer models of neural function have not only generated powerful new tools for the interpreting of the brain but have also fed back into computer theory and practice .

The converging conceptual worlds of computational theory and neuroscience are <head>expressed</head> in the huge and powerful neural nets of parallel distributed processors and in the emergent science of cognitive neurobiology in which the brain is approached as an immensely complex information processor ( see Chapter 7 ) . A third reason for the accelerating rate of advance in neuroscience is that there are simply larger numbers of better funded people engaged in research in this field today than ever before .  And they come from diverse backgrounds :  not only physiologists but also physicists ,  molecular biologists and mathematicians are attracted into neuroscience which threatens to displace physics and even molecular biology as the queen of the sciences .

There are roughly three kinds all of which can use one or a mixture of dance styles .  The story ballet A story ballet demands that the circumstances and events occurring as the plot unfolds will be seen to affect the lives and personalities of the characters involved and that dance and gesture will <head>express</head> moods ' emotions and action . Since Fokine broke away from the rigid categories of dance or mime ,  twentieth - century choreographers ,  following his example ,  have usually created a continuous design of expressive movement which interprets the story by means of mimed dance or danced mime  ( see page 58 )  .  The stories can range from the most tragic such as The Rake 's  Progress  ,  Romeo and Juliet  and Mayerling  to the lyrical fantasy of The Dream  and from the subtle and poignant A Month in the Country  to the happily funny La Fille Mal Garde  or the rumbustious Pineapple Poll  .

Some of the same movements are repeated yet again in the final pas de deux  ,  when the Prince raises her high above the glistening Stars before leading  her away to the land where they lived happily ever after ,  where all fairy tales should end .  Dance leitmotifs can be found in most of Ashton 's  ballets and are sometimes marked by his particular use of one step or pose .  This was first apparent in The Quest ( 1943 ) where the arabesques danced in many ways became the movement through which Una ( danced by Margot Fonteyn ) <head>expressed</head> the emotions aroused when she is assailed by the four false Knights and then her joy when rescued by St. George . Ashton has other ways of creating a leitmotif to link incidents pertinent to the plot throughout a ballet .  These are not necessarily created through dance and music .

Generally speaking ,  choreographers can approach their task in three different ways .  An objective view  Choreographers wish to <head>express</head> themselves through dance because a story , theme or music has inspired them . Their work will require strict adherence by the dancers to a distinctive style of dance and gesture ,  which is designed to communicate thoughts ,  moods ,  emotions and actions as the plot ,  theme or dance unfolds .  They insist that there must be no deviation from that style and demand such loyalty that their dancers lose their own identity and become absorbed in the world of that particular ballet .

This definition should be understood as the choreographer 's  ability to establish a style of movement through which the audience will feel and understand what the performers are communicating through a particular way of dancing .  The style must disclose and be expressive of the moods ,  emotions and actions of the roles played even where few personal feelings are allowed to show ,  as in such ballets as Ashton 's  Monotones  where all that is needed is a calm ,  unhurried and seemingly endless weaving of the dance design in all its dimensions .  Nevertheless the three dancers in Monotones are <head>expressing</head> their close relationship to each other and to the space in which they dance and above all to the flowing lines of the design and of the musical phrases . The composer Satie confessed to his friends that his music was probably inspired by a study of the friezes on ancient Greek vases .  It is surely not surprising that  Ashton was similarly inspired .

If choreographers study the above works of Ashton and MacMillan ,  they will understand how far the art of choreography has developed since Fokine changed its structure and texture .  They will perhaps understand even better if they pay particular attention to the fine details of every movement .  It is no longer the case that the romantic style means dancing classically from the feet to the waist and above that allowing the body , arms and head to <head>express</head> themselves to describe the moods , emotions and actions of the characters . It is well known that only a great dancer - artist can suggest the development of the sixteen - year - old Aurora ,  happy at her birthday ,  into the dreamy figure the Prince meets in the woodland glade and on to her final entrance as a triumphant princess fully awake to her responsibilities as Queen - to - be .  The enchanements  she dances  thoughout  the three scenes do not change in style or content .

Definition of Character and National ballet A Character Ballet  is one in which classical technique is discarded except where it is used to depict particular and usually fantastic characters as for the dolls in Petrushka  and La Boutique Fantasque  .  Instead , a particular style of dance is used through which the performers play strongly defined characters who <head>express</head> not only social status in a particular community but also moods , emotions and actions , which are alien to the calm spaciousness of classical dance . Such ballets range from The Green Table   ( Kurt Jooss 1933 )  and Faade   ( Ashton 1931 )  to Robbins '  Fancy Free   ( 1944 )  .  A National Ballet  is one which is based firstly on the traditional stories ,  dance ,  music and customs of a particular country and/or secondly on the atmosphere ,  texture and typical life of a country .

Susan Williams ,  London .   Range West is in the best hands Although agreeing in principle with the views <head>expressed</head> by Jim Perrin in his article Range War ( May issue ) , I feel I must take issue with one or two of his conclusions , which I think require further examination . Opening an area such as this to the public means just that ,  and together with genuine walkers and climbers arrive the wild flower pickers ,  the egg stealers and the litter louts .  And despite the Ramblers '  Association suggestion of management etc ,  we have not made too good a job of protecting other wilderness areas open to the public .

But One grey - haired captain ,  a rough old chap ,  sat and sat not saying a word ,  mute as a mackerel ,  then suddenly got up in the middle of the room ad ,  you know ,  said aloud as if speaking to himself ,  If there 's  no God then what sort of a Captain am I after that ?  ,  ad seized his cap and threw up his arms and went out .  He <head>expressed</head> a rather sensible idea , said Stavrogin , ad yawned for the third time .

Those who feel hostile to much recent literary theory but are unwilling or unable to formulate their objections often lazily dismiss it as merely another Parisian fashion ,  citing the rapid displacement or structuralism by poststructuralism as evidence that the writings or Barthes ,  Derrida ,  Lacan and their American epigones constitute a craze rather than a serious intellectual movement .  There may be some justification for the  ( insular )  suspicion that when the Emperor is restocking his wardrobe he usually shops in Paris ;  but the rashionability or ideas does not or itself constitute an honest argument against them ;  indeed ,  to offer this as one 's  main response is to betray intellectual bankruptcy .  It is less easy , but more interesting , to try to understand why ancient radical doubts about the ability or language to <head>express</head> a genuine extra - linguistic reality have been revived in recent decades to the point where they seem to have achieved an almost popular appeal . Tallis sets himself the task of showing that much of the structuralist and poststructuralist enterprise is based on a misreading of Saussure .  Two aspects of Saussure 's  thought that have become well established in popular - academic consciousness are the distinctions between  ( a )  langue  and parole  ,  a language - system and its particular manifestations ;  and  ( b )  signifier and signified .

Many of them would do perfectly well in disciplines which are less idiosyncratic than English and have a more obvious international currency ,  like linguistics or economics or marketing .  But in this respect ,  at least ,  English in the English academy ,  as Leavis liked to emphasize ,  is not just another subject .  It <head>expresses</head> a mystique , is to a high degree culture - specific , can seem elusive , and is not easily reduced to the rules and agreed procedures of other disciplines . It is not just overseas graduate students who have problems .  We must all have known home undergraduates who have worked very hard on an English course ,  who may be ambitious to do well ,  and who still ,  to their intense disappointment ,  end up doing badly .

Despite the contempt expressed in the past for the American principle of publish or perish ,  British universities are more and more looking at volume of publication  otherwise ,  performance indicators  as a sign of virtue .  Quantity is easier to consider than quality ,  of course ,  and I have found that a promotions committee can be thrown into bemusement and mild disarray by suggesting that many of the publications on a candidate 's  CV might better have not been published .  To <head>express</head> such thoughts is to feel oneself uncomfortably situated between opposed concepts of what a university is . Leavis ,  Lewis ,  and Gardner shared traditional values ,  even though Cambridge and Oxford spoke with different accents .  Common to the passages quoted above is the assumption that it is possible to denounce academicism or professionalism whilst being a member of the academic profession .

This seems to be intimately connected with another principle ,  which is more radical and therefore more important :  that of quantity  ,  of syllables as being ,  in relation to their contiguous syllables ,  either long or short .  The variation between English - language speakers about what syllables ,  in effect what vowels ,  they treat as long or short ,  is so great that there can be no question of imposing on English verse a quantitative metre such as was used for ancient Latin  ( doubtless with some strain for those who spoke classical Latin with dialectal variations as to quantity )  .  This granted , it remains true , as anyone 's experience of his own and others ' speech - habits will confirm , that some English vowels are experienced and <head>expressed</head> as relatively long , others as relatively short . Not just unmetrical poets like Pound  ( for the most part )  and Bunting ,  but also a strictly metrical poet like the later Yvor Winters ,  came to think that the finest auditory effects in English - language verse were attained by those poets who attended to the quantitative elements in British or American speech as an incalculable dimension super - added to the recognized and calculable dimensions of syllable - count and stresscount .  Quantity in this sense ,  duration  ,  is what musicians and musical  composers are continually concerned with ;  and so it is not surprising that poets of this way of thinking ,  like Pound and Bunting ,  show themselves avidly interested in poetry which has been ,  not at a level of theory but as a fact of performance ,  intimately associated with music :  poetry that has been set ,  or has been written in the hope of being set ,  to music .

Under the apparent terms of the Transportation Secretary 's  new regulations ,  BA would have to slash its contribution by 500m  probably killing the staff buyout  and would effectively lose its representation on the UA board .

British Department of Transport officials have <head>expressed</head> concern about the probable restrictions and urged an open and free investment climate . The irony of Mr Skinner 's  re - regulation of the airline industry ,  say Wall Street analysts ,  is that it comes after the shake - out among domestic carriers has taken place and serves only to reinforce the advantages enjoyed by the surviving majors .  Mr Skinner 's  real concern is not United 's  loyalties in the event of an Anglo - American war but the bargaining strength of the US industry in international negotiations .

More generally ,  Roach has reservations about the direction the music took after bebop  There was a change - over :  it went into dance and party music ,  functioning as an entertaining vehicle rather than an intellectual ,  enlightening thing  and he sees the effects of this slackening of purpose in the playing of a number of later - 1980s musicians .  Roach is a busy man :  as well as continuing work with his quartet  ( currently touring the UK )  ,  his double quartet ,  a percussion ensemble known as M'Boom and a forthcoming collaboration on a play about the Harlem Renaissance ,  he 's  also involved with New York rappers in a project called From Bebop to Hiphop and Then There 's  Max .

September 's  7.6 per cent inflation rate follows one of 7.3 per cent in August and compares with a current peak of 8.3 per cent in May .  Although inflation in October is expected to decline to around 7.2 per cent ,  because a 1.25 per cent increase in mortgage rates in October last year will drop out of the annual comparison ,  the recently announced increases in mortgage rates will send inflation back up again in November .  Economists yesterday <head>expressed</head> concern that the increase in prices was becoming more generalised . Excluding the impact of mortgage rates ,  regarded as the best guide to the underlying trend ,  inflation rose 0.1 points to 5.8 per cent in September ,  which suggests that high interest rates have yet to subdue inflation significantly .  But there was little reaction to the news in the London market .

It has three Vermeers  ( only 30 exist )  ,  notably Head of a Girl and View of Delft  ( to Proust ,  the most beautiful painting in the world )  ,  a dozen jolly Steens ,  full of lasciviousness and coded morality ,  a dozen or more great Rembrandts ,  and Paulus Potter 's  huge Young Bull .  These are the products of an age when the Dutch were the richest people in the world the Japanese of their time and they <head>expressed</head> their wealth by painting , not scenes of classical grandeur , but homes and streets , faces and families .

Casual encounters on the beat are kept to a minimum by the public ,  primarily ,  the police claim ,  as a result of intimidation ,  and constables get few opportunities to display the interactive skills that might foster good community relations ,  although the rare occasions when this happens are seized upon by the men and recalled with pleasure thereafter .  Moreover , neighbourhood police <head>expressed</head> a sensitivity to the effect which these casual encounters might have on the safety of those they talked to for you do n't know who 's watching . Therefore ,  they try to conceal the fact that they are talking to people ,  sometimes by giving the impression through non - verbal behaviour that they are issuing directions ,  or by calling at their homes .  However ,  casual or conspired encounters with the public are infrequent and a primary duty is to deliver court summonses and warrants .

Though the news was at least relatively balanced and impartial ,  the balance was achieved by giving time and attention to a variety of alternative viewpoints ,  not by suppressing diversity .  None the less ,  viewers seemed to resent their lack of choice and lack of control over what they saw .  The variety of television news ( and current affairs ) programmes allowed them to choose the degree of depth and detail they wanted , but not the political viewpoints <head>expressed</head> . In Britain ,  unlike some European countries ,  there is no choice between a right - wing and a left - wing television news channel .  So while television scored well in terms of public service ,  it scored less well in terms of freedom of choice .

Resistance of this kind was to keep the authorities extremely nervous throughout 1922 ,  and one has the sense from the enormous detail of the Smolensk Archive that fear of outright revolt and even counter - revolution was ever present in the local Party 's  thoughts .  Roslavl ' officials would have lain quieter in  their beds at night if they had bothered to read Maxim Gorky 's  book On the Russian Peasantry  published that same year .  He pointed out that peasant opposition to government did exist , but on account of Russia 's huge distances it <head>expressed</head> itself more by evasion than through open fighting . This psychology naturally lingered on into the supposedly liberal atmosphere of NEP in the form of the utopian hope that obligations imposed from the Centre ,  as the peasants put it ,  could be avoided ,  whilst retaining economic rights .  At the end of the winter of 19212 a cautious directive went out from Roslavl ' Party headquarters to all local head collectors of the tax in kind .

The employers acknowledged that ,  in addition to the force of public opinion ,  another way to curb prices would be to establish a body  ( probably  a prices commission )  to examine particular prices and report on them publicly .

This last was <head>expressed</head> in other words as willingness to see the ratio between profits and incomes preserved at a reasonable level by a tax which would become operative upon all industry when a certain figure was exceeded by profits as a whole . Now ,  when you find management  the representatives of enterprise and risk capital  standing up in public and saying that they have a responsibility to keep prices stable ,  or lower them ,  that individual prices ought to be reported on by a commission ,  and that profits ought to attract special tax penalties if they exceed a certain level ,  then it is a sign that either the millennium has arrived or else something is going very seriously wrong indeed .

The commission has no criterion ,  because it can  have no criterion ,  to decide which prices ought to go up and by how much ,  or vice versa  .  As long as the public is not prevented from choosing one thing in preference to another ,  people will express their choice by what they are prepared to pay for the one compared with the other. Every change in the preferences of the public at home or abroad , every alteration in supply and demand those dreadful archaic words had to be pronounced sooner or later will <head>express</head> itself in a change of prices . But the only way to find out which  prices and how much  change is to suck it and see .  Either the commission intuitively knows how supply and demand will change  in which case the commission is miraculous but unnecessary  or else the commission is applying some other unspecified standards and judgements of its own  in which case the commission will be a tyrant if it can impose its decisions and a laughing stock if it cannot .

However complex  the outward manifestations of the religious life may be ,  at bottom it is one and simple .  It responds everywhere to one and the same need ,  and is everywhere derived from one and the same mental state .  In all its forms , its object is to raise man above himself and to make him lead a life superior to that which he would lead , if he followed only his own individual whims : beliefs <head>express</head> this life in representations ; rites organize it and regulate its working . This passage sheds much light on the method of Mr. Eliot 's  Sunday Morning Service where the self - mutilation of enervate Origen is placed in the same lineage as the sexual origin of the Word ,  and where the initial sapient sutlers of the Lord who Drift across the window - panes is a passage with an ambiguous ,  or better ambivalent ,  reference ,  since it holds together in one term both the sable presbyters who bring offerings to church and the bees who bring pollen from one part of the plant to another and so perform the Blest office of the epicene .  Religion is presented as a response everywhere to one and the same need :  the need for rituals of fertility .

He wondered if art could continue to exist or be justified if it left behind its primitive purposes with the result that aesthetic objects became direct  objects of attention .  Sweeney Agonistes  ,  as much as the later prose of Arnold ,  is an attempt to come to terms with this situation and to react against it .  Eliot 's solution was to attempt to revive what anthropology had revealed to him as the very oldest form of ritual and <head>express</head> it through the phenomena of stylized contemporary life , uniting the savage and the city . That he thought this possible is suggested by his comments on Frazer whom he saw not as an investigator of a remote and hence irrelevant past ,  but as someone whose researches are like Freud 's  ,  of apparently universal application ,  applying not to a particular historical period but to the soul .  Frazer ,  through setting out to study an essential ritual of the primitive dead ,  had done what Eliot hoped modern literature ,  including Sweeney Agonistes  would do .

With the fedayeen ,  love always at once complicates and simplifies the narrative .

In 1988 and 1989 the Public divisions between the Prime Minister and her Chancellor were Politically and economically damaging .   The view that Britain was moving to Prime Ministerial government was largely encouraged by Mrs Thatcher 's  dominant personality ,  which became more marked following the Falklands war .  But there were other factors as well : her ruthless dismissal of Cabinet dissenters in 1981 and sacking of the Foreign Secretary in 1983 , the abolition of the CPRS , her close involvement in the promotion of Permanent Secretaries and her tendency , by publicly <head>expressing</head> her own views on controversial issues , to pre - empt Cabinet discussions .

Snowden ,  unlike Samuel ,  was willing to agree in late September to a prohibitive tariff on luxury goods .

There is some evidence that it was Snowden who suggested the formula of the doctor 's  mandate ,  at a Cabinet meeting on 5 October ,  under which the component parts of the National Government were each to issue their own manifestos ,  with a separate personal appeal from the Prime Minister ,  According to Neville Chamberlain ,  Snowden produced the suggestion that the Prime Minister should issue his own manifesto asking for a free hand i.e. on tariffs and the two Party leaders should each issue their own programmes and to our astonishment this was at once accepted by the Liberals ,   ' Amery ,  who perhaps got the information from Chamberlain ,  wrote in his diary on 6 October ,  Apparently when the deadlock seemed most complete Snowden suggested that the PM should issue his own manifesto ,  each of the other party leaders issuing theirs .  ' Tom Jones ,  whose source was Lothian ,  also said that the formula was Snowden 's  .  It is ironic that ,  after the National majority had been safely won ,  and shown itself ,  as might have been predicted ,  protectionist ,  Snowden reverted to the role of stubborn free trader ,  and gave currency to  the view of MacDonald as a feeble halfwit ,  without principles or dignity ,  Yet MacDonald ,  although no doctrinaire free trader ,  had fought harder to reach a formula that the Liberals ,  Snowden 's  free trade allies ,  could accept than Snowden himself had done .

In the end Maxse 's  impatience with and apparent willingness to consider abandoning established institutions meant that he stretched his Conservative credentials to breaking - point ,  and it is important to note that when at his most extreme Maxse was most isolated .

That the views of Edwardian Conservatives elided so easily with those <head>expressed</head> by such a maverick as Maxse is evidence of how threatened the Conservatives felt and how far they were prepared to use a radical voice to pursue Conservative ends . That they were not prepared to countenance Maxse at his most radical confirms that those ends were indeed Conservative .  If it was the Conservative Party 's  circumstances that gave Maxse 's  brand of radical Conservatism its appeal ,  it was also the change in the party 's   circumstances wrought by the war which relegated Maxse to the margins of Conservative politics .

Finally ,  in a further stage of development ,  the inequality within the family develops into slavery which is already  latent in the family .  This stage is reached not just as a result of the increasing complexity of the productive technology ,  in this case the development of agriculture ,  but because agriculture implies a growth in population density ,  an intensification of social intercourse ,  and an increased division of labour .  The division of labour here is a notion used in part to <head>express</head> the fact that with more complex technology one gets more specialization in society , however for Marx and Engels such differentiation also always implies inequality . In this idea Marx and Engels are different from earlier writers such as Adam Smith ,  or later writers such as Durkheim ,  who say nothing necessarily inegalitarian in the division of labour .  The tribal stage ,  with its three subdivisions ,  is itself followed by one of two alternatives :  either by the stage of the city state or be feudalism .

Formen  ,  as these notebooks are often called ,  offers the background to two of the most famous remarks in the whole of Marx 's  work .  The first is the remark in Volume I of Capital  that commodity exchange  ( a necessary prerequisite to capitalism )  begins where community life ends .  The second is the statement of a clear evolutionary sequence in the Preface to a Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy , the work where Marx <head>expresses</head> p. 83 most coherently his theory of history : In broad outlines Asiatic , ancient , feudal and modern bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society . If the evolutionary scheme given in the Preface  seems absolutely clear and definite ,  this is not the picture which emerges from the less systematic Formen  .  As in The German Ideology  ,  we seem to start with a similar early evolutionary stage which is roughly described as tribal and which in itself divided into three .

A problem with this point of view is that there is in fact no evidence of descent groups having ever  existed without these two levels and it seems difficult to treat all documented cases as transitions from a stage for which there is no evidence .  In any case ,  the contradiction which Marx stresses very largely disappears when we realize that it is a matter of the context in which claim to land is expressed .  From the point of view of the outsider the descent group appears as undifferentiated and this will be <head>expressed</head> by statements of the commonality of the resources of claim while , from the point of view of the insider dealing with other insiders the descent group appears highly differentiated . There is however an implied point in the discussion of the gens which ,  I believe ,  is justified in all societies principally organized by descent group  ( though not necessarily all societies where descent groups merely occur as one among many other social institutions )  .  In such societies one does not find internal differentiation based on differential wealth ,  and if such differentiation appears to develop ,  it is resisted .

There are ,  I think ,  just three statements which count as unequivocally critical comments on SI in the Scrapbook .  They appear in the documents section and therefore do not ,  we may take it ,  represent the views of the editors .  Firstly , Art Language 's piece Ralph the Situationist <head>expresses</head> considerable misgivings about the Situationist project : The texts are effectively incorrigible and self insulating ; bland incoherence a self - contradictory absurdity a moral ground to give up reading and remembering , and so on . Whatever gave Francis ,  or whoever it was ,  the idea that Art  Language had anything to do with the Situationists ?  On what basis is this reference made ?

The case for Merz ,  Pistoletto and Buren may be different ,  but it is not unreasonable to expect a rationale for the proclaimed indebtedness of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art to the Situationists .  Nowhere in these publications are these connections argued for :  they are merely dogmatically asserted .  Given the withering contempt <head>expressed</head> by the Situationists for prositus , one shudders to think what Debord et al . are going to make of the quasi - situationists discovered in America by Elisabeth Sussmann .  On the basis of her understanding ,  it appears that any artist in the USA who uses the conventions of the mass media in such a way as to produce a critique of the media  ( and I can think of a good many )  is veritably a quasi - situationist .

Repair and repointing work was kept to a minimum and new pointing was carefully matched to the colour of the original joints .  Features such as cranes ,  loading bays and the 25m  ( 83ft )  high free - standing chimney were retained and the original windows were replaced with steel casements of similar pattern  ( Plate 49 )  .  The importance of maintaining the relationship between the building and the river was <head>expressed</head> not only in the provision of the boat jetty , which is linked to the common room , but also in the balconies , connected to the main circulation galleries of every floor , which overlook the water . Clearly ,  all flats located in the northern part of the building enjoy views both up and down the river ,  because the building is located in a concave curve of the Thames .  Several flats have living rooms in which the loading - bay doors of the original warehouse have been converted into fully glazed French windows sited behind simple steel railings .

There was genetic inheritance ,  of course ,  and Paul was well crude ,  like all boys ,  but it did n't work the way Omi was suggesting ,  nothing like it .

Exactly ,  and remember ,  art and sport have this in common ,  they are both means of self - expression .  But they are more than just that .  A child screaming is <head>expressing</head> itself , or like those artists who daub things in the West they say they are expressing themselves . It was clear from Frulein Silber 's  face that she did not think highly of modern art .  But with discipline ,  art and sport are ways of developing  one 's  personality .

One thing that struck me was the great need to bear children .  I myself have five children and in England this raises an eyebrow ,  but in Kenya I was often asked would I be having another soon .  And frequently women would <head>express</head> to me their need to be pregnant again . Passing on life to another generation is seen as a great privilege and joy .  And it is important that the west does not crush this African life - style with our selfish talk of over population .

The lighting cameraman may have been going through a bad patch ,  or simply been driven crazy by the sort of director who ca n't make up their mind about anything .  It may have been that the editor did n't know how to cut a scene ,  or that the financiers called in a hack to re - edit the picture .  Critics are free to <head>express</head> opinions on such matters , but most of what you hear is pure speculation . What one knows is that ,  when a film works ,  it 's  because writer ,  director and producer were working in harmony and could inspire everybody else on the project with their joint vision .  So when one producer or studio is responsible for a string of hits ,  it 's  only necessary to find out what distinguishes its operation from that of other ,  less successful ,  operations ,  or what has changed when the same producer or studio hit a bum run ,  to discover what makes for successful film production .

And yet one sincerely wishes them well ,  but there just does n't seem anything to say .  But while the gap between the filmmakers and the critical culture could seem an unbridgeable chasm ,  there were people with feet in both camps who were discussing how to wrest British cinema away from its dual dependence on the stage and American models .  In a letter to the London Evening News of the late 1920s , Hitchcock <head>expresses</head> his own sense of how Hollywood models could be redeployed in a British context : The Americans have left us with very few stories to tell .  But there is no reason why we should not tell stories of English  boys who leave the village and make good in the city  why rural drama should not be found and filmed among the mountains of Wales and moors of Yorkshire .

He also imported cameramen ,  make - up staff and editors from Europe and America ,  so that those working at the studio could learn the more advanced techniques .  Most important of all ,  he inspired the people who worked for him with a vision of what they were doing .  Just as the Hollywood moguls built an , albeit mythic , vision of the American dream , so Balcon , from a Jewish immigrant family , felt that films should <head>express</head> England . This conviction brought forth the rebuke from Michael Powell that Balcon was suburban ,  but it was the sense of purpose Balcon gave to his employees that distinguished Gaumont - British from other local studios .  This interest in national subjects could have led to cosiness as it tended to during Balcon 's  time at Ealing Studios ,  but at this period he was under pressure from the Ostrer Brothers to maintain a diversity in his output and aim for the international market .

THEY were brave women and often poetic .  Zena ,  a sculptress ,  took on the responsibility of caring for her Down 's  Syndrome grand - daughter when the mother upped and offed .

And when she took this most precious creation to art school ,  the teacher said :  Zena ,  why did n't you tell us ?  Then she could cry and let people comfort her .

The decision to open that border ,  and the prospect of German reunification ,  will virtually paralyse the military side of the alliance .  Even the Nato arms controllers meeting in Vienna ,  whose job it is to negotiate East - West reductions in conventional armed forces ,  can only pursue their objectives on the basis of confrontation between their alliance and the Warsaw Pact .  Although the proposed treaty will be signed individually by the 23 states in the two blocs , the reductions will be <head>expressed</head> as collective ceilings , to be enforced by the two integrated military commands . Until now ,  this paradox was merely an awkward problem for the lawyers .  How do you arrange for sovereign democratic nations to constrain their defence programmes ?

Kiwis deserve belated fruits Paul Fitzpatrick on New Zealand 's  quest for recognition .  THE New Zealand Rugby League tourists must envy the amount of publicity  and the financial rewards  currently being enjoyed by their countrymen from the unsullied amateur world of Rugby Union as the latter grind their remorseless way around Wales and Ireland .  Earlier in the tour Hugh McGahan , the Kiwis ' captain , <head>expressed</head> his surprise and delight at seeing his men given comparable prominence to the All Blacks in some northern editions of the papers at least . But in truth their tour ,  the English section of which ends with the third Test at Wigan today ,  has been persistently downbeat .  They must accept a share of the blame .

His complaint ,  at the annual meeting of the NCC ,  led to an intervention by Mr David Trippier ,  the Environment Minister .

Sir William , who was <head>expressing</head> a personal view because of internal differences over the reorganisation , said that to split the NCC into three would remove a strategic overview in formulating national policies . Separate country agencies for England ,  Scotland ,  and Wales ,  with their limited responsibilities and sectional place ,  could not carry sufficient clout .  And the grant of 40 million would need doubling to provide the same level of service .
