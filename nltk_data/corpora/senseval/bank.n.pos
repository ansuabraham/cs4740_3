In the true tradition of the pub boom at the turn of the century ,  although decidedly grand ,  most of these refurbishments do not take themselves deadly seriously .  The alabaster  freizes  of monks with  scatalogical  Latin inscriptions created by Henry Poole for the Blackfriar in c.1905 come from the same tradition as the eclectic and irreverent use of ethnic imagery and architectural detail built into the new Horniman at Hays Galleria of 1986 .

But Roderick Henderson ,  who runs the chef division of recruitment consultant Berkeley Scott ,  does not believe that contract catering is always a financially rewarding sector in which to work .  He estimates that an executive sous - chef working in a top London restaurant or hotel would be earning between 25,000 and 27,000 ,  whereas a head chef in contract catering at a director 's  dining room ,  for example ,  would be doing very well to earn 20,000 .  Brian Watts , managing director of B. E.

Also ,  these are the basic rates of pay for a basic 35 - hour week ,  and generous overtime rates are paid for late - night and weekend work .  Watts has interviewed chefs who are working an average of 90 hours per week in the West End and earning about 14,000 .

Most pilots have been shown the effect of gross over - ruddering during their basic training .  The following demonstration compares a stall with a little too much rudder to a stall in a slightly slipping turn ,  and shows how even slightly too much rudder has a significant effect at the stall .  Start to circle in a normal turn with about 20 of <head>bank</head> , keeping the yaw string exactly in the middle while you reduce speed very gradually . ( On most types of training glider it will be possible to get down to the pre - stall buffet and continue with either a slight rocking of the wings or a very gentle inner wingdrop .  )  Keep the rudder where it is and allow the speed to increase a few knots so that both you and the student can observe the exact position of the rudder pedals .

Most beginners will find it difficult to apply the opposite rudder ,  because of their ingrained habit of using the stick and the rudder in co - ordination .  It is also surprisingly difficult to hold accurate heading during a full airbrake sideslipping approach .  You need to be familiar with the type of glider you are flying because each needs slightly different angles of <head>bank</head> and behaves differently when side - slipping . Many types have a pot pitot in the nose and the ASI indicates a false reading during side - slip .  On some ,  the rudder overbalances badly and there is a bad trim change .

Many types have a pot pitot in the nose and the ASI indicates a false reading during side - slip .  On some ,  the rudder overbalances badly and there is a bad trim change .  Most only need a small angle of <head>bank</head> , as the rudders on gliders are not very powerful . Normally you will want to use full side - slip for a few seconds rather than a small amount of slip for a much longer time .  Provided that the need of slipping is spotted straight away ,  it should never be necessary to side - slip close to the ground .

Provided that the need of slipping is spotted straight away ,  it should never be necessary to side - slip close to the ground .  The slip is used just to get rid of the excess height so that less than full airbrake is required for the rest of the approach .  With most gliders , the easiest way to enter a side - slip and to hold the heading is to freeze the rudder central while applying the <head>bank</head> . Provided the approach path was correct beforehand ,  the adverse yaw as the aileron is applied swings the nose off to just about the right point to keep the glider on the correct path .  The opposite rudder is then applied to hold that nose direction and to prevent the glider from turning .

Provided the approach path was correct beforehand ,  the adverse yaw as the aileron is applied swings the nose off to just about the right point to keep the glider on the correct path .  The opposite rudder is then applied to hold that nose direction and to prevent the glider from turning .  Most beginners apply the opposite rudder too harshly and this makes it difficult to hold the <head>bank</head> constant . It is easiest at first to limit the rudder movement to half or three quarters of the full deflection and to start by applying the banking movement just before applying the rudder .  By all means practise side - slipping at height ,  but do n't assume that because you can do it at height you will be able to do it accurately on an approach .

Attempt this in a gentle turn as well ,  and in a gentle turn with a little too much rudder .  This time it will almost certainly drop a wing ,  but just easing forwards a little will make a recovery .  Try some very steep turns and then some with about 40 of <head>bank</head> ; try reversing the turn quickly , and making little centring moves . Of course ,  if there are thermals about ,  do all this in the lift ,  provided there are no other gliders sharing your thermal !  You should be able to go into turns and make centring movements without having to refer to the slip ball ,  yaw string ,  or ASI .

This is a matter of constantly exploring out a few yards on almost every circle to try to find the best possible area of lift .  Frequently this involves turning steeply at low speed to keep the radius of turn to a minimum and to make use of the narrow cores of lift .  Remember , thermal soaring is more about staying in the strongest area of lift than flying at an efficient angle of <head>bank</head> ; it usually pays to turn steeply , as the small turning circle enables you to keep in the narrow cores of strong lift . If flying across country is not practical and you are local soaring ,  it is better to practise moving from cloud to cloud or thermal to thermal without taking the climbs to any great height .  For example ,  on a day with a 3000 foot cloud base ,  climb to 2500 feet on the first climb ,  then fly off leaving that thermal ,  using the airbrakes if necessary to come down to try to find another one at 2000 feet .

Then do the same  on an easterly or westerly heading .  Also try changing speeds .  You will discover large errors flying near north or south with even small amounts of <head>bank</head> , and large errors on east and west if you vary the speed . Compass errors are an awful nuisance and it is well worth finding out a little about them .  You also need to become accustomed to thinking and using degrees ,  and deciding whether you need to turn left or right to change the heading .

SOCIAL SECURITY  HOUSING BENEFIT :  GUIDANCE ON THE TREATMENT OF INCOME A recent DSS Housing Benefit/Community Charge Benefit circular has given guidance about the treatment of income which is paid at intervals other than one week .  Where income such as an occupational pension or Retirement Pension is paid into a <head>bank</head> or building society account on , for example , a monthly or four - weekly basis , in some cases this has been treated as capital resulting in a possible reduction of benefit . In effect it appears that the pension has been assessed both as income and capital .  The circular states that income to cover a certain period should be ignored as capital for that period .

Now ,  the Talleyrand - Perigords have ,  as their name implies ,  been mighty lords in Perigord since the early Middle Ages ,  and in the early poem Near Perigord Talleyrand is one of the powerful and menacing neighbours whom Bertrand de Born has to play off one against another ,  thus earning  ( so Pound 's  poem suggests )  the title which Dante gives him in the Inferno  ,  sower of strife .  The chteau of Chalais has been a stronghold of the Talleyrands from that day to this ,  and when Pound in recent years read about Napoleon 's  grand chamberlain ,  notably in the memoirs of Madame de Rmusat  ( a principal source for Canto 101 )  ,  this new association with Chalais re - activated his memories of that place ,  which accordingly is named afresh ,  bringing Aubeterre with it ,  but in a quite different tone and spirit from to set here the roads of France .  The trees that line the <head>banks</head> , mostly willows are still there , and there are places in the town of Chalais crouched underneath its chteau , where Pound might still creep over old rafters in search of a stream full of lilies . Pound seems to have misremembered ,  however ,  for at Chalais the river is not the Dronne but a smaller stream ,  the Tude .  And although the Tude has plants in its waters ,  I am reluctant to believe that any of them are lilies ;  for Chalais has suffered from the twentieth century as Aubeterre has not ,  and the Tude is polluted whereas the Dronne runs clear .

THE 33m management buyout by Fenchurch Insurance Group from GPG has been completed despite pressure for a better price from GPG shareholders including Robert Maxwell .  Mr Maxwell ,  with 15 per cent of GPG ,  the old Guiness Peat Group ,  and Lord Kissin ,  with a five per cent stake ,  strongly opposed plans to sell off three of GPG 's  operating companies .  But shareholders voted by three to one last week to back the sell - offs which will reduce borrowings to a consortium of <head>banks</head> , who acquired 61 per cent of GPG after the collapse of the New Zealand Equiticorp business . The mbo of Fenchurch was engineered by JO Hambro Magan ,  whose managing director Alton Irby said :  It shows that leveraged buyouts can be done ,  even if this one was difficult .

He explained that the structure evolved because the group needed equity to finance growth .  Several of the quoted subsidiaries and associates also control other businesses ,  for example Solveg ,  a property portfolio management company ,  in which several CB group companies have stakes .  This structure is typical of the continental , as distinct from the British , firm : the holding group , particularly the bank holding group , stems from equity involvement in industry , an involvement shunned by British <head>banks</head> . At the same time ,  CB ,  as it became in 1959 ,  has seen the source of its earnings diversify as consumer finance became more and more important to the group .  Loans made in 1979 totalled FFr59.1m ,  of which property accounted for FFr40m and consumer finance accounted for FFr9.29m ,  or 15.7 per cent of the total .

The system outlined by Lord Donaldson ,  a man not known for his left tendencies ,  bears marked similarities to those operated in a number of eastern bloc countries .  The drift of his remarks is likely to find favour with the Lord Chancellor ,  Lord Mackay of Clashfern ,  who said last year that many litigants wanted fuller participation in the legal process rather than acting as bystanders in cases conducted by lawyers .  Lord Donaldson then attacked Lord Mackay 's White Paper proposals for <head>banks</head> and building societies to undertake conveyancing . Although the near - monopoly enjoyed by solicitors was indefensible because it related only to the preparation of documents ,  there is a real need for consumer protection and I am far from sure that the White Paper proposals meet this need ,  he said .  Conveyancing documents should include a certificate by the purchaser saying either that he had been fully advised by a wholly independent practitioner or that he had declined such advice  and the certificate should contain a prominent health warning against declining to take it .

Moreover ,  it is notoriously difficult to predict the costs of major infrastructural projects ,  almost all of which run wildly over budget .

Financial staff had not given councillors detailed information about the scope or extent of its involvement on the money market .

On the other hand , if they are not enforceable , it would be the <head>banks</head> , with whom the transactions were arranged , that would lose out as they had taken out further deals to offset their exposure . As a result ,  five banks  Midland ,  Security Pacific National ,  Chemical Bank ,  Barclays Bank and Mitsubishi Finance Corporation  have been joined as respondents with the council .  In the two financial years 1987 - 88 and 1988 - 89 ,  the council had been involved in 592 deals amounting to a notional 6,052.5m .

Eurotunnel ,  the Anglo - French consortium that will operate the twin - rail tunnel when it is scheduled to enter service in June 1993 ,  shocked the City by announcing that costs had risen by 2.2bn from an original estimate of 4.8bn ,  with the 50 - kilometre tunnel still only one - quarter built .  The consortium also disclosed that it would need up to 1.6bn in fresh finance on top of the 6bn already raised .  The gloom was deepened further by the disclosure that the independent technical adviser to <head>banks</head> financing the project puts the cost at 8.1bn and believes the tunnel will open six months late , in December 1993 . The crisis surrounding the tunnel threatens to embarrass the Government ,  which insisted it be financed entirely by the private sector .  The escalation in costs is certain to shake the confidence of private investors who have spent 1bn on the project .

Eurotunnel ,  which is already in default of its credit agreement with the banks ,  has in effect been given until the end of the year to settle its differences with the contractors to permit a viable financing strategy to be put in place .  If agreement cannot be reached ,  the banks ,  which include National Westminster and Midland ,  have the power to close the project or bring in fresh management .  Last night Alastair Morton , the British co - chairman of Eurotunnel , said the <head>banks</head> could be driven to this by sheer exasperation through lack of progress in the talks . However ,  Mr Morton added :  Technically it is serious .  The banks can pull the plug .

In a statement issued with Andre Benard ,  his French counterpart ,  Mr Morton said he believed agreement could be reached in time to put a fresh financial package in place by early next year .  This would involve raising an extra 1.2bn to 1.6bn .  Of this , 25 per cent would come from a share issue in 1990 or 1991 and new <head>bank</head> borrowings . However ,  a number of essential differences between Eurotunnel and Transmanche Link need to be resolved .  These include agreement on curbing the cost of terminals and equipment  where the contactors '  estimate is 382m higher than that of Eurotunnel .

Both ,  however ,  want the right to process Switch transactions on behalf of their retail clients .  The catalyst is the Government 's  decision in August to uphold a recommendation from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that the credit card networks Visa International and Mastercard should alter one of their membership rules .  This rule , still in existence while Visa and Mastercard fight a rearguard action with the Office of Fair Trading , prevents <head>banks</head> from processing card transactions until they have built up a large base of card - holders . Now Lloyds and Barclays argue that the debit card network should bow to the same principle  and that they should be allowed to process Switch transactions without first issuing Switch cards to their account - holders .  Switch is likely to resist any such application .

Along with the merger , Postbank shareholders will be asked to approve a change to the <head>bank</head> 's articles of association so that it can engage in wider areas of business . It is not allowed to engage in securities trading or insurance ,  which would make the merger difficult as NMB is one of the leading options traders in the Netherlands .

SIR GEOFFREY LITTLER ,  a former Treasury official and currently a director of NatWest Investment Bank ,  has been asked by the International Stock Exchange to head a committee which will develop proposals for a clearing house in securities .  The move follows the announcement in July by the International Stock Exchange that it intended to set up a clearing house to handle existing and projected settlement services in London .  It would be a joint venture , the exchange indicated , with the exchange perhaps owning 40 per cent with the remainder controlled by 20 or more institutions , such as <head>banks</head> , registrars , securities houses and large financial institutions as well as some listed companies . Other members of the Littler committee named yesterday are Jonathan Agnew of the British Merchant Bankers Association ;  Martin Cruttenden of Lloyds Registrars ;  Ian Cormack of Citicorp ;  Pen Kent of the Bank of England ;  William Legge - Bourke of the International Stock Exchange ;  Andrew Palmer of Associated British Investors ;  Herschel Post of the International Stock Exchange ;  and Alex Tweedie of the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers .  Andrew Hugh Smith ,  chairman of the exchange ,  said he believed that the clearing house will involve market users more directly in the development of settlement systems and so enable the UK to achieve the rapid development of a paperless settlement ,  payments and registration system for domestic equities .

Eurotunnel shares fell sharply following revelations of spiralling costs .  Admission of a 2bn cost overrun has sent Eurotunnel back to the banks to plead for fresh financing .  The <head>banks</head> have given Eurotunnel until the end of the year to come up with an agreed costing for completion of the Channel Tunnel . As the Transport Secretary ,  Cecil Parkinson ,  ruled out any Government help ,  Eurotunnel shares fell to a low of 550p ,  down 145p on the week .  There was no respite for the beleaguered retail sector .

Time bomb ticking away under budget borrowers :  As the base rate rises 1 per cent both homeowners and investors look set for troubled times ahead By MARTIN BAKER BRITAIN'S 7.6 million homebuyers face another rise in mortgage repayments following this week 's one per cent hike in <head>bank</head> base rates to 15 per cent . This is its highest level for eight years and will result in an increase of at least one per cent on home loan rates ,  possibly more .  The average borrower with a 30,000 25 year loan will see monthly repayments rise from 278 a month to 298 if the mortgage rate goes to 14.75 per cent as expected .

According to reliable sources ,  however ,  Italy is paying only 0.25 per cent to its underwriters .  Bankers close to the deal say that Morgan Stanley was forced reluctantly to accept a lower commission structure because Italy was being offered this by other banks competing for the business .  The fear now is that <head>banks</head> will start to compete by driving commission rates lower and lower until they are prepared to arrange issues at break - even or worse . And this would vindicate those who believe that the market 's  ills are not going to be solved by tinkering with new issue processes ,  but rather by a drastic cutback in the overheads  ie ,  sacking people  being carried by the industry .

Threat to insurers AS THE 1.1bn takeover bid by Australian Mutual Provident ,  Australia 's  largest life insurer ,  gets underway for the Pearl Group ,  a new survey suggests that perhaps the Australians should have made a bid for a building society .  The survey ,  prepared by the giant reinsurance group Swiss Re ,  shows that building societies pose a growing threat to insurance companies .  In it , 1,500 individuals were asked : If you were to buy life assurance , which of the following methods , if any , would you choose from a salesman in your own home , from a broker in his office , by post ( either from a newspaper advertisement or from a mailshot ) , from a <head>bank</head> , or from a building society . The responses indicated that 28 per cent would prefer to buy through a building society ;  27 per cent said they would buy from a salesman in their own home .  Only 2 per cent would choose to buy a policy through the post ,  while 26 per cent opted for the broker route .

They fear that having separated post and telecommunications ,  France Telecom will receive the lion 's  share of the budget and may ultimately be privatised altogether .

In countries where deposits above a certain amount have to be authorised ,  such as those over 10,000  ( 6,250 )  in the United States ,  this entails a team of flunkeys making numerous lower deposits which are then switched around at will .  Alternatively ,  a courier will smuggle often millions of pounds at a time to a country where banking secrecy offers greater protection .

One of these was said to be a 5m loan to Raper 's  master company ,  the Hong Kong and Netherlands based Gasco Group .  This was given nine months before the bank collapsed and financed Gasco 's  takeover of Cornish tin mining company St Piran .  When the <head>bank</head> went into liquidation repayment was demanded and Raper immediately started a 15m action for damages , saying it was being called in earlier than agreed . A long - running legal wrangle ensued with Gasco assets ultimately being frozen and a court undertaking secured from St Piran not to reduce its UK assets below 7m ,  sufficient to cover the SIB claim .  This undertaking was given to the High Court in London but in March last year Vice Chancellor Sir Nicolas Browne - Wilkinson found Raper and the man described as his sidekick ,  Douglas Allen ,  guilty of the most deliberate and serious contempts .

What there is is a strong difference of commercial opinion .  However ,  it is clear the two sides are far from agreement on the extra 382m TML claims the tunnel terminals and fixed equipment will cost ,  which Mr Morton described as manifestly absurd .  He refused to be drawn on what would happen if the two failed to reach agreement in time to get the <head>banks</head> ' support for an extra 1bn - 1.2bn of finance next year . Without a satisfactory agreement the banks could refuse to lend more money on top of the 6bn in total committed to the project and demand that Eurotunnel be replaced .

However ,  it is clear the two sides are far from agreement on the extra 382m TML claims the tunnel terminals and fixed equipment will cost ,  which Mr Morton described as manifestly absurd .  He refused to be drawn on what would happen if the two failed to reach agreement in time to get the banks '  support for an extra 1bn - 1.2bn of finance next year .  Without a satisfactory agreement the <head>banks</head> could refuse to lend more money on top of the 6bn in total committed to the project and demand that Eurotunnel be replaced . Mr Morton ,  said he was pretty confident that would not happen .  If a deal was hammered out with the banks ,  an accompanying rights issue to raise up to 400m from existing private shareholders was likely next spring .

The common view is that this is unthinkable and politically unacceptable .  But some bankers have an acute awareness of where their loyalties lie and the idea of winding Eurotunnel up and continuing the project with a new management company may have its attractions .  It would ensure that the tunnel was completed and would give the <head>banks</head> much more direct access to the project and its long - term rewards . The only losers would be the shareholders but they always knew this was a high - risk project .  The negotiations with the banks are complicated by the discussions with the contractors .

THE HALIFAX ,  Britain 's  biggest building society ,  yesterday attempted to stem a wholesale move to 15 per cent mortgage rates by announcing a comparatively modest 1 - point hike in its own lending rate to 14.5 per cent .  The announcement ,  hastily brought forward from the middle of the month ,  was designed to forestall other lenders from following the Yorkshire Building Society ,  which lifted its rate to 15 per cent at the weekend .  The benchmark now set by the Halifax is certain to influence how other societies respond to last week 's 1 - point increase in <head>bank</head> base rates to 15 per cent . There are fears that large mortgage rate hikes could tip the already stagnant housing and mortgage market into deep and long - lasting recession .  A Halifax spokesman said :  Hopefully this will give the lead to other building societies to restrict their increases to 1 per cent .

However ,  Wall Street 's  collapse raises spectres of a repeat of the 1987 stock market crash ,  in which lead and sub underwriters were obliged to take up shares at prices well below those quoted in the market .  Airline Acquisition Corp ,  the management and pilot group that had agreed to pay 300 a share for United ,  announced at 2.54pm New York time that its agent banks ,  Chase Manhattan and Citibank ,  had found insufficient interest in the issue because of adverse changes in the market for this transaction .  Rumours in the market said that Japanese <head>banks</head> which had initially indicated a willingness to put up some of the necessary funds , were behind the problems . A statement said the group would submit a revised proposal for senior financing for the deal in the near term .  UAL said that it had been advised by AAC that syndication of the financing would be possible on revised terms .

But the reports still fell short of conclusively identifying the ultimate recipients of the money .  Faced with the prospect of a stream of disclosures as the general election approaches ,  Mr Gandhi 's  advisers have apparently concluded that their best defence is also to attack the opposition with the corruption stick .  The leader of the Janata Dal party , VP Singh , has found himself and his family under scrutiny in recent weeks over highly suspect allegations that his son controlled a secret <head>bank</head> - account in the Caribbean island of St Kitts . The allegations that Mr Singh ,  a former Congress  ( I )  finance minister ,  had stashed millions of dollars in a numbered St Kitts account ,  were made in August in the Arab Times of Kuwait ,  not previously known for its scoops about India .  It said the account was controlled by Mr Singh 's  son Ajeya ,  a New York - based accountant .

The saving on interest rate costs by taking out a foreign currency mortgage is obvious enough  about 5 per cent to 6 per cent .  The big pitfall is the prospect of a currency loss if sterling declines still further ,  which can wipe out the benefit of interest rate savings and leave the borrower owing more debt than he borrowed in the first place .  Because of this , foreign currency mortgages , which are being sold very heavily at the moment by financial intermediaries ( linked to <head>banks</head> and other financial institutions which are providing the funds ) , are only for the financially sophisticated . There are ways of hedging against the exchange rate risk .  One method is to switch the foreign currency loan back into sterling if you think that sterling will weaken significantly  more than a possibility .

London  Capital ,  which is linked to UCB ,  the French - owned mortgage company ,  provides a comprehensive foreign currency mortgage service for UK and overseas properties .  Behind the intermediaries are British <head>banks</head> , and British and Scottish insurance companies . Their rationale for entry to this flourishing new market is easy to understand .  With the UK housing market flat ,  and with competition high ,  business generated by foreign currency mortgages can generate a higher turn for the lender than UK mortgages ,  and produce extra fees and commissions for the intermediary arranging the facility .

But for those with loans over 30,000 where there is no tax relief ,  it is certainly worth considering paying off some of the mortgage  -  particularly since there is no clear indication of when rates might come down. But if it is bad news for borrowers ,  investors have never had it so good .  Returns of 12 per cent and more are on offer from <head>banks</head> and building societies while the rate of inflation even taking into account this latest mortgage rate rise is around 7.5 per cent . Investors are getting a real return of 4.5 per cent on their cash .  This looks like the best return available on income bonds but investors should move fast as these offers tend to be fully subscribed very quickly .

This vision ,  what Eliot called Kipling 's  knowledge of the things which are underneath ,  and of the things which are beyond the frontier ,  ,  was what made some of Kipling 's  short stories so important to the writer of The Waste Land  .  It was like Frazer 's  looking into the abysm of time ,  but it was a vision only imperfectly appreciated by Charlie Mears ,  as the narrator of The Finest Story in the World emphasizes :  Above all ,  he was absolutely ignorant of the knowledge sold to me for five pounds ;  and he would retain that ignorance ,  for bank - clerks do not understand metempsychosis ,  and a sound commercial education does not include Greek .  To find its most lasting realization , Charlie 's vision would have to wait for a bank clerk who did understand metempsychosis , and who had not only a commercial education gained in an underground room at Lloyds <head>Bank</head> , but also a knowledge of Greek . The Waste Land 's   tone would be grimmer ,  throbbing between two lives .  But when such a bank clerk followed Charlie ,  Rudyard Kipling entered The Waste Land  .

If there was to be an escape ,  it was to lie not in the damp gust bringing rain but in Shantih as the Buddhist 's  passing beyond the cycles of creation .  Eliot was unable to renounce the world he knew .  He remained with Vivienne , the <head>bank</head> , and years of exhaustion in which he came close to death . He decided eventually that to embrace Buddhism would be to plunge into a world too culturally alien .  In the time following The Waste Land  he saw the world despairingly ,  in terms of inane ,  savage horror .

That same year he worried over Slum Areas concerned about overcrowding and the possible creation of new slums .  But it was the city 's  spiritual health which most preoccupied him ,  though he realized spiritual and economic were not always inseparable .  In a paragraph whose subtitle , City , City , harks back to The Waste Land , he expressed astonishment that in an economic slump the City was pulling down buildings to erect ever more splendid <head>banks</head> . Eliot was fond of familiar details of a London which ,  in a sense ,  he had known all his life ,  ever since the childhood reading of Sherlock Holmes which he recalled in 1929 .  It was his own spiritual change which made possible after the poems of the early twenties a more affectionate view of London ,  but we should not assume that the owner of Down the Silver Stream of Thames  had ever been totally blind to the beauty of the city .

Once through ,  we really cut loose .  This bit of park had just enough hint of wilderness to be readily transformed in imagination into prairie ,  canyon ,  rain forest ,  river delta ,  open sea .  Our hinterland of the imaginary actually consisted of grass tussocks , brambles , a grove of willows , some hawthorns , a beech tree or two , drainage ditches , a slow and deep brook with steep <head>banks</head> , a weir , twin tunnels which took the stream beneath the main Derby to Nottingham road and , upstream , a wooden footbridge and wobbly stepping stones . All in all ,  the perfect showcase for a new identity as hero .

He was sitting there with his head in his hands ;  he did not rise when the train passed ;  he made no movement ;  he did not give a glance at the signs I made him ;  and for a long time as the train was carrying me away ,  I watched his little motionless ,  grief - stricken figure ,  lost in the desert ,  an image of my own despair .

It had many difficulties in controlling M3 ,  which proved to be an unreliable barometer .  An influential report by Professor Jurg Niehans in February 1981 argued that monetary policy was in fact excessively tight because the high interest rates were attracting foreign money to London and maintaining a high pound .  Difficulties in exercising control were also increased by the civil service dispute during 1980 and the increase in <head>bank</head> lending for mortgages . Another measure ,  of narrow money ,  was Mo ,  which covered cash ,  the banks '  till money ,  and the Bank of England 's  operational cash ,  and the Chancellor set a target for this as well .

In spite of complaints by business about the pound 's  appreciation  ( in May 1979 its effective exchange rate was 81.3 per cent and in January 1982 it was 92 per cent of its 1975 rate )  the government came to rely on a strong pound as part of its anti - inflation strategy .  Contrary to declarations that there was no government policy for sterling and that it would be left to the markets to decide ,  by late 1981 the government intervened to reverse a fall in the exchange rate ,  and raised base rate to 16 per cent .  It did the same again in January 1985 ; when the pound fell to 1.12 <head>banks</head> were instructed to raise interest rates by 1.5 per cent . The record high interest rates were attractive to holders of sterling even though they were also damaging to business .  The exchange rate policy was highly damaging to manufacturing .

When you 're in a defence industry that is inevitable .  There were fundamental differences between these two government departments  between two ministers  and Westland was piggy - in - the - middle ,  which was a very costly and unfortunate experience .  The important issue for me as chairman throughout that period was to remember that once the Prime Minister had said that Westland was a private - sector problem which must be solved by private - sector measures and techniques , one 's interests were obviously the shareholders , the employees , the customers and the <head>banks</head> , since the company was heavily indebted . One was not then justified in thinking and functioning in terms of what might be in the national interest ,  what might ultimately be a desirable development for NATO strategy or defence strategy .  It was rather a more specific and harsher problem which ,  to put it bluntly ,  was to survive as Westland was drifting on to the rocks of insolvency .

What was interesting about that was that at the time John Brown got into financial difficulties the banks and institutional shareholders took a tough but very constructive view that it was worth helping the company through a reconstruction rather than forcing it into liquidation ,  which had been an attitude prevalent some years earlier .  It was in fact my experience of working with the banks and institutions for the recapitalisation and reconstruction of John Brown which led me to think that the City is much maligned over its attitudes to industry and the accusation of short - termism is not justified .  The institutions and <head>banks</head> had been immensely supportive in helping save the company . When I was approached over Westland ,  it was by some of the banks and institutions that had been involved in the John Brown affair .  One of my reasons for becoming involved in Westland was that I felt in some respects that I owed them something .

The gap between the willingness to lend and the capacity to receive is partly due to the fact that the majority of donors have country lending ,  or granting ,  targets .  The staff members they deploy in the field to identify projects are under pressure from their senior management to turn such targets into reality .  Working within an embassy office or the regional office of a multilateral <head>bank</head> it is not difficult for donors ' staff to come up with a list of potential projects which can be presented to a recipient country 's ministry of finance for discussion . Overworked officials in finance ministries rarely reject a whole list of potential projects ;  they are much more likely to identify a few priorities at random ,  and pass on the donor to the line ministry ,  hoping for the best if and when the project is financed .  Once a project is on a donor 's  priority list it takes on a life of its own ,  and may become unstoppable .

Few lakes or reservoirs start to warm up until late March ,  and the deeper ones are normally cold well into May .  The shallow bays may be a degree or two warmer ,  and are always the first place to look in the early days ,  but the deeps will stay cold until real strength returns to the sun .  Fish normally seek out the warmer shallows , and if there are a few days of sunshine before opening day then you will know where to choose on the <head>bank</head> .

Most impressive was the number of retired people we met backpacking .  They came mainly from Stockholm or ,  at least ,  southern Sweden and most had been trudging these paths for decades .

One fellow told me ,  apologetically ,  that he and his wife only did ten to fifteen kilometres daily these days. He added quickly that there was no hurry any more .

Campsite ,  Vengsya I learned to canoe years ago when three of us put borrowed boats in the water at Glasbury and pulled them out ,  finally ,  several days later at Tintern ,  having gone down the Wye .  for many hours on day one the river seemed amazingly narrow , one <head>bank</head> of it always being on the front end of my canoe . By the time I reached Tintern I could go in straight lines easily and had a right wrist the size of a tennis ball that was painful to touch and crackled ominously when I flexed it .

The crane ratchets of the later arrivals could still be heard clearly as their crews outramped ,  and rising bow waves could be spotted as an occasional laggard powered upstream to its proper place in the echelon .

Most pilots have been shown the effect of gross over - ruddering during their basic training .

Start to circle in a normal turn with about 20 of <head>bank</head> , keeping the yaw string exactly in the middle while you reduce speed very gradually . ( On most types of training glider it will be possible to get down to the pre - stall buffet and continue with either a slight rocking of the wings or a very gentle inner wingdrop .  )  Keep the rudder where it is and allow the speed to increase a few knots so that both you and the student can observe the exact position of the rudder pedals .

Most beginners will find it difficult to apply the opposite rudder ,  because of their ingrained habit of using the stick and the rudder in co - ordination .  It is also surprisingly difficult to hold accurate heading during a full airbrake sideslipping approach .  You need to be familiar with the type of glider you are flying because each needs slightly different angles of <head>bank</head> and behaves differently when side - slipping . Many types have a pot pitot in the nose and the ASI indicates a false reading during side - slip .  On some ,  the rudder overbalances badly and there is a bad trim change .

Most only need a small angle of <head>bank</head> , as the rudders on gliders are not very powerful . Normally you will want to use full side - slip for a few seconds rather than a small amount of slip for a much longer time .

Provided that the need of slipping is spotted straight away ,  it should never be necessary to side - slip close to the ground .  The slip is used just to get rid of the excess height so that less than full airbrake is required for the rest of the approach .  With most gliders , the easiest way to enter a side - slip and to hold the heading is to freeze the rudder central while applying the <head>bank</head> . Provided the approach path was correct beforehand ,  the adverse yaw as the aileron is applied swings the nose off to just about the right point to keep the glider on the correct path .  The opposite rudder is then applied to hold that nose direction and to prevent the glider from turning .

Provided the approach path was correct beforehand ,  the adverse yaw as the aileron is applied swings the nose off to just about the right point to keep the glider on the correct path .  The opposite rudder is then applied to hold that nose direction and to prevent the glider from turning .  Most beginners apply the opposite rudder too harshly and this makes it difficult to hold the <head>bank</head> constant . It is easiest at first to limit the rudder movement to half or three quarters of the full deflection and to start by applying the banking movement just before applying the rudder .  By all means practise side - slipping at height ,  but do n't assume that because you can do it at height you will be able to do it accurately on an approach .

Attempt this in a gentle turn as well ,  and in a gentle turn with a little too much rudder .  This time it will almost certainly drop a wing ,  but just easing forwards a little will make a recovery .  Try some very steep turns and then some with about 40 of <head>bank</head> ; try reversing the turn quickly , and making little centring moves . Of course ,  if there are thermals about ,  do all this in the lift ,  provided there are no other gliders sharing your thermal !  You should be able to go into turns and make centring movements without having to refer to the slip ball ,  yaw string ,  or ASI .

This is a matter of constantly exploring out a few yards on almost every circle to try to find the best possible area of lift .  Frequently this involves turning steeply at low speed to keep the radius of turn to a minimum and to make use of the narrow cores of lift .  Remember , thermal soaring is more about staying in the strongest area of lift than flying at an efficient angle of <head>bank</head> ; it usually pays to turn steeply , as the small turning circle enables you to keep in the narrow cores of strong lift . If flying across country is not practical and you are local soaring ,  it is better to practise moving from cloud to cloud or thermal to thermal without taking the climbs to any great height .  For example ,  on a day with a 3000 foot cloud base ,  climb to 2500 feet on the first climb ,  then fly off leaving that thermal ,  using the airbrakes if necessary to come down to try to find another one at 2000 feet .

Then do the same  on an easterly or westerly heading .  Also try changing speeds .  You will discover large errors flying near north or south with even small amounts of <head>bank</head> , and large errors on east and west if you vary the speed . Compass errors are an awful nuisance and it is well worth finding out a little about them .  You also need to become accustomed to thinking and using degrees ,  and deciding whether you need to turn left or right to change the heading .

How do I raise the money I am to pay ?  The amount that you are assessed to pay is based on what you should be able to afford to take out as a loan .  It may be that you choose to obtain a mortgage , second mortgage or a loan from a <head>bank</head> . If you feel that you will be unable to take out a loan in this way or that it will cause you financial hardship ,  you can apply to the Social Services Department for help .  They will ask you further information about your finances and/or your situation and may then in certain circumstances by able to offer you a loan .

one of my sections in the subdivision is thinking of declaring UDI unilateral declaration of independence from the Divisional Headquarters as for Headquarters and the Force organizational structure ,  well that 's  just a joke as far as these men are concerned .  This rejection of a distant headquarters and enhancement of their own special identity occurred some seven years after the last amalgamation .  In that same year I was posted to South Shields on the south <head>bank</head> of the River Tyne and quickly became aware that I had an enormous burden to carry , simply because I had spent all of my previous service on the other side of the river . At one point a uniform sergeant listening to me discuss some tactic ,  gloomily pointed out that my style was not theirs ;  but then ,  he rationalized ,  how could it be ,  you 're from the north  side of the river .  The emphatic denigration contained in this locational insult had to be heard to be understood ,  and in many ways it paralleled the dismissive tone used to deride the civvy ,  for nuances of speech and tone have immense meaning to insiders .

Now ,  the Talleyrand - Perigords have ,  as their name implies ,  been mighty lords in Perigord since the early Middle Ages ,  and in the early poem Near Perigord Talleyrand is one of the powerful and menacing neighbours whom Bertrand de Born has to play off one against another ,  thus earning  ( so Pound 's  poem suggests )  the title which Dante gives him in the Inferno  ,  sower of strife .  The chteau of Chalais has been a stronghold of the Talleyrands from that day to this ,  and when Pound in recent years read about Napoleon 's  grand chamberlain ,  notably in the memoirs of Madame de Rmusat  ( a principal source for Canto 101 )  ,  this new association with Chalais re - activated his memories of that place ,  which accordingly is named afresh ,  bringing Aubeterre with it ,  but in a quite different tone and spirit from to set here the roads of France .  The trees that line the <head>banks</head> , mostly willows are still there , and there are places in the town of Chalais crouched underneath its chteau , where Pound might still creep over old rafters in search of a stream full of lilies . Pound seems to have misremembered ,  however ,  for at Chalais the river is not the Dronne but a smaller stream ,  the Tude .  And although the Tude has plants in its waters ,  I am reluctant to believe that any of them are lilies ;  for Chalais has suffered from the twentieth century as Aubeterre has not ,  and the Tude is polluted whereas the Dronne runs clear .

THE 33m management buyout by Fenchurch Insurance Group from GPG has been completed despite pressure for a better price from GPG shareholders including Robert Maxwell .  Mr Maxwell ,  with 15 per cent of GPG ,  the old Guiness Peat Group ,  and Lord Kissin ,  with a five per cent stake ,  strongly opposed plans to sell off three of GPG 's  operating companies .

He explained that the structure evolved because the group needed equity to finance growth .  Several of the quoted subsidiaries and associates also control other businesses ,  for example Solveg ,  a property portfolio management company ,  in which several CB group companies have stakes .  This structure is typical of the continental , as distinct from the British , firm : the holding group , particularly the bank holding group , stems from equity involvement in industry , an involvement shunned by British <head>banks</head> . At the same time ,  CB ,  as it became in 1959 ,  has seen the source of its earnings diversify as consumer finance became more and more important to the group .  Loans made in 1979 totalled FFr59.1m ,  of which property accounted for FFr40m and consumer finance accounted for FFr9.29m ,  or 15.7 per cent of the total .

The system outlined by Lord Donaldson ,  a man not known for his left tendencies ,  bears marked similarities to those operated in a number of eastern bloc countries .  The drift of his remarks is likely to find favour with the Lord Chancellor ,  Lord Mackay of Clashfern ,  who said last year that many litigants wanted fuller participation in the legal process rather than acting as bystanders in cases conducted by lawyers .  Lord Donaldson then attacked Lord Mackay 's White Paper proposals for <head>banks</head> and building societies to undertake conveyancing . Although the near - monopoly enjoyed by solicitors was indefensible because it related only to the preparation of documents ,  there is a real need for consumer protection and I am far from sure that the White Paper proposals meet this need ,  he said .  Conveyancing documents should include a certificate by the purchaser saying either that he had been fully advised by a wholly independent practitioner or that he had declined such advice  and the certificate should contain a prominent health warning against declining to take it .

The most powerful is that the figures , inaccurate as they have turned out to be , convinced experts employed by big investors and <head>banks</head> such as National Westminster . Moreover ,  it is notoriously difficult to predict the costs of major infrastructural projects ,  almost all of which run wildly over budget .

The consortium also disclosed that it would need up to 1.6bn in fresh finance on top of the 6bn already raised .  The gloom was deepened further by the disclosure that the independent technical adviser to <head>banks</head> financing the project puts the cost at 8.1bn and believes the tunnel will open six months late , in December 1993 .

Both ,  however ,  want the right to process Switch transactions on behalf of their retail clients .

Restrictions will be placed on drive - in cinemas , <head>banks</head> , hamburger restaurants and , presumably , LA 's solitary drive - through church . New ,  less polluting designs will be required for a cornucopia of products made or sold in the city ,  ranging from aerosol sprays to roll - on deodorants ,  and paints and varnishes .  Non - radial tyres ,  which apparently launch miniscule fragments of rubber into the atmosphere ,  will be banned .

That view is presented in a classical French ,  rarely illustrated ,  and then only with the smallest photographs or the occasional line drawing .  It follows an editorial policy that believes foreign news should lead the first three pages ,  that matters of national interest should be philosophically debated in the newspaper 's  columns ,  and that half a page of sport either side of the weekend is enough .  Having survived a financial crisis in the early 1980s , thanks to support from the <head>banks</head> and from a staff prepared to agree to a voluntary wage freeze , the paper is now making money and putting on readers , so why has the management now decided to modernise the title ? On first sight it might seem a case of plus ca change ,  plus c'est la meme chose .  The differences are minimal :  cleaner print ,  a slightly smaller format somewhere between tabloid and broadsheet ,  the masthead underlined in blue and ,  the most striking development :  the appearance of separate sections .

But the intention is for the 49 per cent Dutch government shareholding to be reduced later this year through an issue in Amsterdam ,  London ,  Frankfurt ,  Paris and New York .  The issue will complete the transformation of the Postbank ,  which is the world 's  largest postal savings bank ,  from a sleepy adjunct to the Dutch post office ,  which it was less than five years ago ,  to an international banking force .  Along with the merger , Postbank shareholders will be asked to approve a change to the <head>bank</head> 's articles of association so that it can engage in wider areas of business . It is not allowed to engage in securities trading or insurance ,  which would make the merger difficult as NMB is one of the leading options traders in the Netherlands .  NMB Postbank will have a dominant position in Dutch savings and money transfers .

SIR GEOFFREY LITTLER ,  a former Treasury official and currently a director of NatWest Investment Bank ,  has been asked by the International Stock Exchange to head a committee which will develop proposals for a clearing house in securities .  The move follows the announcement in July by the International Stock Exchange that it intended to set up a clearing house to handle existing and projected settlement services in London .  It would be a joint venture , the exchange indicated , with the exchange perhaps owning 40 per cent with the remainder controlled by 20 or more institutions , such as <head>banks</head> , registrars , securities houses and large financial institutions as well as some listed companies . Other members of the Littler committee named yesterday are Jonathan Agnew of the British Merchant Bankers Association ;  Martin Cruttenden of Lloyds Registrars ;  Ian Cormack of Citicorp ;  Pen Kent of the Bank of England ;  William Legge - Bourke of the International Stock Exchange ;  Andrew Palmer of Associated British Investors ;  Herschel Post of the International Stock Exchange ;  and Alex Tweedie of the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers .  Andrew Hugh Smith ,  chairman of the exchange ,  said he believed that the clearing house will involve market users more directly in the development of settlement systems and so enable the UK to achieve the rapid development of a paperless settlement ,  payments and registration system for domestic equities .

One of the 10 said initial investor response was fairly positive .  The issue is using the increasingly popular fixed price US - style system for underwriting and offering Eurobonds .

And this would vindicate those who believe that the market 's  ills are not going to be solved by tinkering with new issue processes ,  but rather by a drastic cutback in the overheads  ie ,  sacking people  being carried by the industry .

There is no suggestion of any impropriety by Mr Ethrington .  However ,  his membership of the team could prove an embarrassment to the Government ,  which is subsidising his bid attempt .  Mr Ethrington has provisional financial backing from the trade union <head>bank</head> Unity Trust to make a bid via an employee share ownership plan . He previously conducted two studies on behalf of the Government into TCS .  The first ,  more than two years ago ,  considered the feasibility of privatisation and followed reports from the Treasury and the Central Purchasing Unit which came out against wholesale privatisation .

Last week ,  Andrew Hugh Smith ,  chairman of the Exchange ,  announced the appointment of Sir Geoffrey Littler as head of the Clearing House Formation Committee ,  which is charged with developing the proposals for the new settlement system .  The Exchange intends that the new clearing house will be jointly owned .  The Exchange will hold around 40 per cent of the shares in the new body with 20 or more groups such as <head>banks</head> , registrars , securities houses and large financial institutions as well as some listed companies holding the remainder . As yet nothing is concrete and ,  following Sir Geoffrey 's  study ,  that initial concept may well change .  The terms of reference of Sir Geoffrey 's  committee indicate that the Exchange is determined that all aspects of the creation of a clearing house are fully explored .

Threat to insurers AS THE 1.1bn takeover bid by Australian Mutual Provident ,  Australia 's  largest life insurer ,  gets underway for the Pearl Group ,  a new survey suggests that perhaps the Australians should have made a bid for a building society .  The survey ,  prepared by the giant reinsurance group Swiss Re ,  shows that building societies pose a growing threat to insurance companies .  In it , 1,500 individuals were asked : If you were to buy life assurance , which of the following methods , if any , would you choose from a salesman in your own home , from a broker in his office , by post ( either from a newspaper advertisement or from a mailshot ) , from a <head>bank</head> , or from a building society . The responses indicated that 28 per cent would prefer to buy through a building society ;  27 per cent said they would buy from a salesman in their own home .  Only 2 per cent would choose to buy a policy through the post ,  while 26 per cent opted for the broker route .

The post office 's  financial viability rests on its investment product ,  the good old post office savings book .

However , the development of specially - tailored funds and financial products to compete with those offered by <head>banks</head> is beginning to get under way and there is a potentially lucrative link - up with the big assurance companies based on the post office 's huge client base . None of this is of any comfort to the unions ,  who are very strongly represented within the PTT and have been united in their rejection of the proposed reforms .  They fear that having separated post and telecommunications ,  France Telecom will receive the lion 's  share of the budget and may ultimately be privatised altogether .

In countries where deposits above a certain amount have to be authorised ,  such as those over 10,000  ( 6,250 )  in the United States ,  this entails a team of flunkeys making numerous lower deposits which are then switched around at will .  Alternatively ,  a courier will smuggle often millions of pounds at a time to a country where banking secrecy offers greater protection .  With their teams of lawyers , accountants and company agents , and able to transfer money at the push of a computer button , the launderers dodge through the maze of the different countries ' jurisdictions creating a trail so complex that investigators , never mind the <head>banks</head> , find it almost impossible to spot what is going on .

One of these was said to be a 5m loan to Raper 's  master company ,  the Hong Kong and Netherlands based Gasco Group .  This was given nine months before the bank collapsed and financed Gasco 's  takeover of Cornish tin mining company St Piran .  When the <head>bank</head> went into liquidation repayment was demanded and Raper immediately started a 15m action for damages , saying it was being called in earlier than agreed . A long - running legal wrangle ensued with Gasco assets ultimately being frozen and a court undertaking secured from St Piran not to reduce its UK assets below 7m ,  sufficient to cover the SIB claim .  This undertaking was given to the High Court in London but in March last year Vice Chancellor Sir Nicolas Browne - Wilkinson found Raper and the man described as his sidekick ,  Douglas Allen ,  guilty of the most deliberate and serious contempts .

The common view is that this is unthinkable and politically unacceptable .

It would ensure that the tunnel was completed and would give the <head>banks</head> much more direct access to the project and its long - term rewards . The only losers would be the shareholders but they always knew this was a high - risk project .  The negotiations with the banks are complicated by the discussions with the contractors .

THE HALIFAX ,  Britain 's  biggest building society ,  yesterday attempted to stem a wholesale move to 15 per cent mortgage rates by announcing a comparatively modest 1 - point hike in its own lending rate to 14.5 per cent .  The announcement ,  hastily brought forward from the middle of the month ,  was designed to forestall other lenders from following the Yorkshire Building Society ,  which lifted its rate to 15 per cent at the weekend .  The benchmark now set by the Halifax is certain to influence how other societies respond to last week 's 1 - point increase in <head>bank</head> base rates to 15 per cent . There are fears that large mortgage rate hikes could tip the already stagnant housing and mortgage market into deep and long - lasting recession .

By CHRISTIAN WOLMAR TRANSACTIONS on the money market worth 6bn undertaken by Hammersmith and Fulham Council may have to be honoured ,  even if ruled unlawful ,  it was suggested in the High Court yesterday .  John Chadwick , QC , counsel for four of the <head>banks</head> which stand to lose millions of pounds should the deals be ruled void , said enforceability depends on how they might be judged unlawful . If the court found the west London council had no powers to undertake them whatsoever ,  then the banks private rights '  to enforce the deals would go .

The saving on interest rate costs by taking out a foreign currency mortgage is obvious enough  about 5 per cent to 6 per cent .  The big pitfall is the prospect of a currency loss if sterling declines still further ,  which can wipe out the benefit of interest rate savings and leave the borrower owing more debt than he borrowed in the first place .  Because of this , foreign currency mortgages , which are being sold very heavily at the moment by financial intermediaries ( linked to <head>banks</head> and other financial institutions which are providing the funds ) , are only for the financially sophisticated . There are ways of hedging against the exchange rate risk .  One method is to switch the foreign currency loan back into sterling if you think that sterling will weaken significantly  more than a possibility .

With the UK housing market flat ,  and with competition high ,  business generated by foreign currency mortgages can generate a higher turn for the lender than UK mortgages ,  and produce extra fees and commissions for the intermediary arranging the facility .

But for those with loans over 30,000 where there is no tax relief ,  it is certainly worth considering paying off some of the mortgage  -  particularly since there is no clear indication of when rates might come down.

Returns of 12 per cent and more are on offer from <head>banks</head> and building societies while the rate of inflation even taking into account this latest mortgage rate rise is around 7.5 per cent . Investors are getting a real return of 4.5 per cent on their cash .

I wondered as I waved ,  Shall I ever see them again ?  I suppose not !  The guns along the <head>banks</head> of the Orne were still firing as I arrived back at the jeep . The Officer was talking to two gunners who appeared to be Polish judging by their accents .  The Commando Officer shook hands with the gunners and we waved our farewells as we drove along the narrow path and on to the road .

Let 's  hope they keep to the field over there ,  at least until we leave the orchard .  Later in the day the shelling ceased so Taff and I were able to get his kit together and make our way through the village to the farm and No. 6 Commando positions .  I left Taff at the entrance to the farm and watched him as he continued along the road then , as he clambered up the grass <head>bank</head> and disappeared among the trees , I turned into the farm . There was a lot of activity in the area of the farm buildings ,  people dashing about even though the farm was being heavily mortared .  Wounded were being brought out from the orchard at the back of the farm which was being subjected to unusually heavy mortaring from the German positions just a short distance across the fields .

I 'll pick you up on the way back .  Gunga drove off over the bridge as I looked around for a suitable spot to get some practice in .  The guns a short distance away along the river <head>bank</head> were shelling the German positions as I started up the bagpipes in a fairly secluded thicket , the sound of the drones and the pipe reed easily drowning the noise of the guns . From the thicket I could see the bridge and to my amazement I could see Commandos marching in file across the bridge and coming slowly towards me ,  a few of them looking and pointing in my direction .  Stopping the pipes and stepping out on the footpath at the side of the river I walked towards the Green Berets .

We ate the fish and polished off some cider while we watched the bombers blasting Caen ,  the British guns along the Orne joining in for good measure .  Twenty - eighth June  this evening I joined the Marine Commandos to take part in a night standing patrol .  These patrols had to be very careful owing to the close proximity of the German positions and the difficult countryside of high hedges and tall earth <head>banks</head> with trees on top . The heavily wooded area was criss - crossed with tracks ,  some leading to farm buildings ,  others leading to a barn in a clearing of corn ,  the whole scene ,  particularly at night ,  required vigilance as the enemy had mined the well - worn tracks .  Many of the German mines were most unusual .

No doubt he feels safer in their presence .

The wounded German Officer was carried up the grassy <head>bank</head> and placed against a tree . He was still conscious and was moaning loudly ,  his head moving from side to side .  I tried to make him as comfortable as possible and with the assistance of a French Commando placed a shell dressing into the large wound in his back .

A French medic was climbing the grassy <head>bank</head> from the sunken road to look at the Officer as I got the prisoners out of the dug - out and back to their previous positions in the hollow .

The polls showed a drift back towards Labour during the campaign and an NOP poll ,  extraordinarily ,  even showed a Labour lead of 0.7 per cent at the end of April ,  though this was not confirmed elsewhere .

It was a good decade for the rentier  and the small investor .

The hero of Kipling 's  story is a London bank clerk who is also an ambitious poet .  His name was Charlie Mears ;  he was the only son of his mother who was a widow ,  and he lived in the north of London ,  coming into the City every day to work in a bank .  The widowed mother , the residence in north London , and the daily travel to work in the London <head>bank</head> were all pad of Eliot 's own experience at the time of the composition of most of The Waste Land . Charlie 's  Business took him over London Bridge .  His poetic efforts are mocked by the narrator of the story ,  who is none the less fascinated by what stimulates Charlie 's  writing .

He came to me time after time ,  as useless as a surcharged phonograph  drunk on Byron ,  Shelley ,  or Keats .  Yet Charlie 's  method also hints at the method which Eliot would use in The Waste Land  :  The plastic mind of the <head>bank</head> - clerk had been overlaid , coloured , and distorted by that which he had read , and the result as delivered was a confused tangle of other voices most like the mutter and hum through a City telephone in the busiest part of the day . It is not only that Charlie 's  lives ,  like those of Tiresias ,  grow confused ;  his expression ,  speaking out of modern London about remote and contemporary affairs ,  all in a confused tangle of other voices ,  like a poetic ventriloquist ,  points in the direction of London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down

This vision ,  what Eliot called Kipling 's  knowledge of the things which are underneath ,  and of the things which are beyond the frontier ,  ,  was what made some of Kipling 's  short stories so important to the writer of The Waste Land  .  It was like Frazer 's  looking into the abysm of time ,  but it was a vision only imperfectly appreciated by Charlie Mears ,  as the narrator of The Finest Story in the World emphasizes :  Above all ,  he was absolutely ignorant of the knowledge sold to me for five pounds ;  and he would retain that ignorance ,  for bank - clerks do not understand metempsychosis ,  and a sound commercial education does not include Greek .  To find its most lasting realization , Charlie 's vision would have to wait for a bank clerk who did understand metempsychosis , and who had not only a commercial education gained in an underground room at Lloyds <head>Bank</head> , but also a knowledge of Greek . The Waste Land 's   tone would be grimmer ,  throbbing between two lives .  But when such a bank clerk followed Charlie ,  Rudyard Kipling entered The Waste Land  .

That same year he worried over Slum Areas concerned about overcrowding and the possible creation of new slums .  But it was the city 's  spiritual health which most preoccupied him ,  though he realized spiritual and economic were not always inseparable .  In a paragraph whose subtitle , City , City , harks back to The Waste Land , he expressed astonishment that in an economic slump the City was pulling down buildings to erect ever more splendid <head>banks</head> . Eliot was fond of familiar details of a London which ,  in a sense ,  he had known all his life ,  ever since the childhood reading of Sherlock Holmes which he recalled in 1929 .  It was his own spiritual change which made possible after the poems of the early twenties a more affectionate view of London ,  but we should not assume that the owner of Down the Silver Stream of Thames  had ever been totally blind to the beauty of the city .

It had many difficulties in controlling M3 ,  which proved to be an unreliable barometer .  An influential report by Professor Jurg Niehans in February 1981 argued that monetary policy was in fact excessively tight because the high interest rates were attracting foreign money to London and maintaining a high pound .  Difficulties in exercising control were also increased by the civil service dispute during 1980 and the increase in <head>bank</head> lending for mortgages . Another measure ,  of narrow money ,  was Mo ,  which covered cash ,  the banks '  till money ,  and the Bank of England 's  operational cash ,  and the Chancellor set a target for this as well .

In spite of complaints by business about the pound 's  appreciation  ( in May 1979 its effective exchange rate was 81.3 per cent and in January 1982 it was 92 per cent of its 1975 rate )  the government came to rely on a strong pound as part of its anti - inflation strategy .  Contrary to declarations that there was no government policy for sterling and that it would be left to the markets to decide ,  by late 1981 the government intervened to reverse a fall in the exchange rate ,  and raised base rate to 16 per cent .  It did the same again in January 1985 ; when the pound fell to 1.12 <head>banks</head> were instructed to raise interest rates by 1.5 per cent . The record high interest rates were attractive to holders of sterling even though they were also damaging to business .  The exchange rate policy was highly damaging to manufacturing .

When you 're in a defence industry that is inevitable .  There were fundamental differences between these two government departments  between two ministers  and Westland was piggy - in - the - middle ,  which was a very costly and unfortunate experience .  The important issue for me as chairman throughout that period was to remember that once the Prime Minister had said that Westland was a private - sector problem which must be solved by private - sector measures and techniques , one 's interests were obviously the shareholders , the employees , the customers and the <head>banks</head> , since the company was heavily indebted . One was not then justified in thinking and functioning in terms of what might be in the national interest ,  what might ultimately be a desirable development for NATO strategy or defence strategy .  It was rather a more specific and harsher problem which ,  to put it bluntly ,  was to survive as Westland was drifting on to the rocks of insolvency .

What was interesting about that was that at the time John Brown got into financial difficulties the banks and institutional shareholders took a tough but very constructive view that it was worth helping the company through a reconstruction rather than forcing it into liquidation ,  which had been an attitude prevalent some years earlier .  It was in fact my experience of working with the banks and institutions for the recapitalisation and reconstruction of John Brown which led me to think that the City is much maligned over its attitudes to industry and the accusation of short - termism is not justified .  The institutions and <head>banks</head> had been immensely supportive in helping save the company . When I was approached over Westland ,  it was by some of the banks and institutions that had been involved in the John Brown affair .  One of my reasons for becoming involved in Westland was that I felt in some respects that I owed them something .

When he was approached to run British Aerospace the government insisted he should give up the directorship of WG ,  but Pearce ,  displaying his usual resolve ,  would n't hear of it .

The gap between the willingness to lend and the capacity to receive is partly due to the fact that the majority of donors have country lending ,  or granting ,  targets .  The staff members they deploy in the field to identify projects are under pressure from their senior management to turn such targets into reality .  Working within an embassy office or the regional office of a multilateral <head>bank</head> it is not difficult for donors ' staff to come up with a list of potential projects which can be presented to a recipient country 's ministry of finance for discussion . Overworked officials in finance ministries rarely reject a whole list of potential projects ;  they are much more likely to identify a few priorities at random ,  and pass on the donor to the line ministry ,  hoping for the best if and when the project is financed .  Once a project is on a donor 's  priority list it takes on a life of its own ,  and may become unstoppable .

As it came through Rose he encouraged it as much as he would have discouraged visits to any other neighbouring house .  She showed them the small lake in its ring of reeds , took them to the first slopes of the mountain , rigged up a fishing rod for Michael and took him to the part of the lake she used to fish as a girl , and soon he was shouting out in glee as he missed the ravenous little perch or swung them out over his head on to the <head>bank</head> .

Few lakes or reservoirs start to warm up until late March ,  and the deeper ones are normally cold well into May .  The shallow bays may be a degree or two warmer ,  and are always the first place to look in the early days ,  but the deeps will stay cold until real strength returns to the sun .  Fish normally seek out the warmer shallows , and if there are a few days of sunshine before opening day then you will know where to choose on the <head>bank</head> . At the moment ,  most reservoirs are filling fast .  In November and December last year the water tables across the land were depleted ,  but the majority have now been replenished .

I predict with some confidence that Chew and Blagdon will be at top levels for the start of the 1991 angling year .

The great thing about having the lakes at top level is there is so much <head>bank</head> to choose from , and we are almost spoilt for choice .

The end of the bridge was clearly visible as it grew out of the far bank ,  and needed only a couple of rafts to make it complete .

The cordon was eventually lifted at 1900 hours and the section flown home ,  only to prepare for a very full day 's  patrolling on the following day .  The day 's  missed training would have to be fitted in some other time .  In Belfast , the day started on a humorous note When , at 0130 hours , the top cover sentry of a mobile patrol from one of the companies of 7th/ 10th ( City of Belfast ) Battalion noticed that the front door of a <head>bank</head> was wide open . The patrol dismounted from their vehicles and ,  having informed the battalion operations room of their find ,  deployed around the bank to await the arrival of the RUC .  As the patrol commander approached the door of the bank ,  he spotted a black briefcase leaning against a wall .

The patrol gave cover as the police approached the building .  Just at that moment a man staggered out of the door of the bank ;  when he saw the tableau of police and soldiers in front of him ,  he threw his arms up in the air .  The RUC sergeant went forward and arrested the man , who turned out to be the <head>bank</head> security guard who was rather the worse for drink , and had forgotten to lock the door ! The whole incident was over within an hour and the patrol was able to return to their base .  South - east of Belfast lies rural County Down ,  the tactical area of responsibility of 3 UDR .
