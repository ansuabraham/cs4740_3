Detentions under section 29 continue ,  and the government acknowledged on March 18 that 16 people were then held under that provision .  Even more prisoners ,  about 60 ,  are currently being held under equivalent provisions in the nominally independent homelands of the Transkei and Bophuthatswana .  Two months ago Amnesty submitted testimony to the UN which <head>noted</head> that the de Klerk government was failing to take adequate steps to investigate and bring to justice members of the security forces implicated in the torture and killing of government opponents . The death of one 16 - year - old under interrogation at a police station in January 1990 has yet to be properly investigated .  A closed hearing held in February this year concluded that no - one could be held responsible for the death .

For him the synthesis was asymptote towards which he was for ever approaching without ever quite reaching it ;  it was a reality ,  incapable of complete realization .  An example of Fry 's  description of Czanne 's  development dealt with colour :  When Czanne uses colour we <head>note</head> that at each nodal point of the interplay of planes , Czanne marks this sequence by a series of small washes of various colours , modulating generally from violet to greenish , or bluish grey . His aim in this was as far as possible to translate changes of tones into changes of colour ,  feeling that only by this method could the full saturation and pressure of colour be realized .  I cannot doubt that this peculiar method which gave such valuable results in water - colour ,  influenced Czanne to apply it at least to the early stages of his oil paintings ,  and that gradually it grew to be his habitual practice in the succeeding period .

Dummies can come to life in books ,  as it seems they can do for their masters on the stage :  and this miracle depends ,  not only on the author ,  but also on the people he knows ,  who may indeed be thought to participate in what he is ,  and who are likely to participate in his ventriloquism .  It may be that Larkin 's  poem and the person we meet there participate in the ventriloquism of Amis 's  novel .  At a mid - point in the novel there occurs McClintoch 's complaint that people are divided into the attractive and the unattractive , rather as , according to Disraeli , as Graham duly <head>notes</head> , Victorian England was divided into the two nations ' of rich and poor . There is a barrier between the attractive and the unattractive  between ,  as Graham puts it on a later occasion ,  the beggars and choosers of the sexual life .  Convinced of his own plainness ,  Graham is here engaged in taking Jenny out and making a mess of kissing her .

Against this monologic Amis can be set ,  by way of alter ego ,  the modernistic Amis of Barbara Everett 's  discussion of Difficulties with girls  ,  which occurred in the course of an essay on Hugh Kenner 's  fantasy of a British betrayal of Modernism ,  and which springs the surprise of conveying that Amis ,  so often supposed an enemy of Modernism ,  is really a Modernist .  She begins by recalling a remark made to her a long time ago by Larkin ,  about difficulties encountered in his private life  a  remark which consisted of a joke to do with the impossibility of relations between men and women ,  followed by the notion that women ought really to marry each other ,  followed by but that would be wrong ,  would n't it ?  And she <head>notes</head> that the same remark , or the same sentences , can be found in Amis 's novel . What interests her ,  apparently ,  is not the remark itself ,  but the degree to which the piece of recall  her piece of recall ,  presumably  failed to affect the novel in any way .  The novel was left curiously unaffected by this discovery .

Perhaps one should <head>note</head> the care with which the present leader of the party , John Hume , chooses his words over the future of the North .

The church was acting on behalf of all ,  and had a prime obligation to push for a public morality which matched its perception of the natural law lest the very fabric of society be torn asunder and its members cast on the road of moral decline .  What was good for catholics was also good for protestants ,  and Ireland was to be no exception .  In fairness to de Valera , it must be said that he opposed any attempt to incorporate the church into the apparatus of the state and in this was , as already <head>noted</head> , going against the form of relationship preferred by the Popes of the day . But his attitude was by now part of the common sense of clergy and people alike .  There appeared to be no reason to upset long - established routines in this respect .

From the church came a dual impulse strengthening this morality :  the prevailing teaching on sexual abstention outside of marriage under pain of mortal sin ,  and the rigorous life of a clergy pledged to chastity and preaching the need for an unmarried laity to practise the same degree and kind of circumspection in sexual matters which the clergy had been taught to impose upon themselves .  If anything ,  the return of the land to the practising farmers by the land Acts would have strengthened such a morality .  It is also interesting to <head>note</head> that the issue of land inheritance was a key reason why the Irish population voted no in the referendum on divorce in 1986 . That the local priests continued to play a significant part in the regulation of local sexual morality from the beginning of the state is shown by accounts of boy meets girl from the 1920s .  For example :  In 1931 we got a new Parish Priest .

Many critics ,  including William Binchy ,  saw this as likely to be an ineffectual provision and subject to the whims of judges .  Proponents of the changes did ,  however ,  find the prognostications of their adversaries far too pessimistic and polemical .  It is interesting to <head>note</head> that the debate centred on the concrete social consequences of divorce legislation rather than on its intrinsic morality . In the Dil debate of 20 May ,  Padraig Faulkner ,  TD of Fianna Fil argued that the introduction of divorce would indeed end up as divorce on demand anyway ,  and Charles Haughey indicated his personal view that divorce was bad for individual stability  (  Irish Times  ,  21 May 1986 )  .  The next stage in clerical campaign strategy was introduced by  Archbishop MacNamara of Dublin who instructed the clergy of his diocese to preach on the indissolubility of marriage on the six Sundays from 18 May until the eve of the referendum .

Based on statistical data for Roman catholics educated in both Roman catholic and other schools , Greeley and Rossi <head>noted</head> as one of their findings that there was little difference in adult religious practice between the two groups . There was a group among former Roman catholic school pupils who exhibited a more intense level of practice ,  but these were also children of fervent Roman catholics .

This is particularly true today :  even in the recession - hit 1990s ,  brewers are spending increasing amounts on pub refurbishment  more on pubs ,  indeed ,  than at any time since the 1930s .  Much of this is due to the face that ,  following the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on pub ownership ,  many breweries are actually moving out of brewing itself and concentrating instead on pub management  an area where they believe they stand to make the greatest profits .  At the end of the 80s the famous Manchester firm of Boddingtons sold its brewing operation to Whitbread ; yet during 1988 alone , Claire Hunt has <head>noted</head> , Boddingtons undertook the refurbishment of 50 of their tied houses . More recently ,  at the end of 1990 the regional brewing giant Greenall Whitley announced that it was closing both its breweries at Warrington and Nottingham  ( formerly the independent Shipstone 's  brewery )  to concentrate solely on running pubs  contracting out its beer to be produced by former rivals Allied Breweries .  The principal victims or beneficiaries of this change of direction are the historic tied houses .

New and increasingly stringent fire regulations have to be accommodated and licensing magistrates  who often care little for the architectural integrity of historic pubs ,  but are principally concerned with good and easy supervision of the pub clientele  have to be appeased .

I believe the denial of the PSI report and the furore it caused occurred precisely because it managed to get beneath the surface of police culture to explore the deep structures of belief and to comment adversely about their influence on police activities .  The invisibility in the written record ,  which Shapland and Hobbs  ( 1989 )  observed ,  and the unrecorded information which Chatterton told the conference remained hidden in the heads of the constables are the result of cultural values ,  which are then brought to bear to deny validity to these agendas .  It is worth <head>noting</head> the language in the Federation rebuttal of the PSI report , for it illustrates how the culture is programmed to sneer at the graphic literary phrase and dismiss the use of anecdotal material as unscientific : while participant observation is considered to be a world away from research based on safe academic principles ( my emphasis ) . Police culture is omnipotent is structuring such views of critical research .  Historically it has homed in on sociology as the generic symbol of reformatory zealousness ,  regarding its practitioners almost as folk devils or bogeymen .

A heavy contact to the opponent 's  face may not merit just a verbal warning ;  after consultation with the other members of the panel ,  the referee can go directly to a full point penalty or even a disqualification .

It is important to remember that the linguistic utterances of others are just as much externally observed behaviour as walking down stairs or pressing a button in a psychophysics laboratory although ,  because of the high information content of linguistic behaviour ,  we are prone to endow it with some mystical quality which opens a special window on to the mind of the person generating it .  We must approach observations of linguistic  behaviour with the same careful attitude as we approach other kinds of behaviour or indeed as we approach our electrophysiological observations .  It is also worth <head>noting</head> that correlations between ERPs and behaviour are never perfect , perhaps because of masking of some of the ERPs by random fluctuations of the background EEG . An individual event which normally gives a particular ERP may sometimes yield nothing and the ERP may sometimes occur in the absence of the evoking event .  It is always the case that averaging over tens of trials is necessary to give consistent results ,  particularly with endogenous ERPs .

COMMUNITY CARE  MENTAL ILLNESS SPECIFIC GRANT A report has been published which looks at the operation of the new Mental Illness Specific Grant in the first few months after its introduction in April this year .  The report summarises the types of schemes which have been launched under the grant , <head>noting</head> that many schemes so funded are not new , but are continuations or expansions of existing provision . The report discusses the implications of the short time local authorities had to plan for use of the grant ,  in particular the difficulties within the time scale of consulting users ,  carers and others in planning for and providing new services .  The adequacy of the capital and revenue parts of the grant are discussed .

Each part of the body must be placed in a true relationship to the others and to the whole as the dance  flows onwards .  This requirement has its origins in Greek sculpture .  Anyone seeing such works of sculpture for the first time cannot fail to <head>note</head> the harmonious line described through the perfectly proportioned bodies of the men and women portrayed . No matter from which angle they are viewed ,  these statues reveal that the head and limbs counter - balance each other round a central line running through the body so that each part is one with the whole picture .

If the right foot remains there for several bars ,  the arms will be held still ,  but as soon as the left moves in front the arms will change .

Means of expression While choreographers who wish to create a character and/or national ballet have an immense amount of material upon which to work ,  they must be very selective if they are to communicate the characteristic and/or purely nationalistic elements which will make a ballet unique .  Moreover , as has been <head>noted</head> earlier , all character dance movements must be more strongly marked both physically and musically than the demi - caractre versions of the same steps . Similarly ,  all the poses and/or gestures performed by each character must be distinctly national ,  no matter how minor a part is being played .   The truly heroic character of Lemminkainen in the great Finnish epic Kalevala  acts ,  according to the story ,  very much in the same way as the heroes of the Anglo - Saxon Beowulf  or the French Song of Roland  and many other heroic poems .

In 1939 ,  for instance ,  in an obituary of Ford for The Nineteenth Century and After  ,  he had written of the stilted language that then passed for good English in the arthritic milieu that held control of the respected British critical circles ,  Newbolt ,  the backwash of Lionel Johnson ,  Fred Manning ,  the Quarterlies and the rest of em .  And this echoed a letter of 1937 to Michael Roberts ,  extolling Ford and saying ,  The old crusted lice and advocates of corpse language knew that The English Review  existed .  In Ezra Pound : The Image and the Real , Herbert Schneidau reasonably enough names three of the crusted lice as Henry Newbolt , Frederic Manning , and G.W. Prothero , and with a proper scrupulousness he <head>notes</head> that all these were treated with great deference in Pound 's early letters and writings . Schneidau follows Pound 's  own broad hints by tracing his gradual alienation or liberation from these early admirations according as Ford 's  demands for a prosaic strength in verse writing gradually won Pound over from the Wardour Street language of his own early poems  ( such as Canzone :  The Yearly Slain '  written in reply to Manning 's  Kor )  .  The story is an intricate one ,  as Herbert Schneidau acknowledges ;  and Pound 's  holding out against Ford for the Dantesque principle of a curial diction  ( see his introduction to the poems of Lionel Johnson )  represents to my mind an objection that can still be raised to Ford 's  principles of diction ,  salutary as Ford 's  polemics undoubtedly were for Pound at this time .

RESEARCHING THE RUC Many people have <head>noted</head> how the police are not helpful in initiating research or in welcoming sociologists ( Greenhill 1981 : 91 ; Holdaway 1979 : 1 , 1983 : 34 ) . In part this reflects a reluctance to let outsiders interfere with the job of policing ,  as well as a suspicion about soci  ology ,  which for many policemen sounds too much like the word socialist ;  social work suffers from the same association .  A constable in Easton once said ,  If anything gets me down it 's  bloody sociology .

The calls can be classified under a number of headings ,  illustrating the range of work which routine policing comprises in Easton  ( for a different classification see Sykes and Brent 1983 :  42 )  .  The first type is public - service calls ,  which includes requests for information ,  such as airport flight times and advice over legal matters ,  and community service tasks ,  such as signing passports ,  pushing  ( and sometimes towing )  broken - down cars ,  giving lifts to young children and youths late at night ,  and making a point of driving around areas of Easton to reassure ,  by their presence ,  worried Old Age Pensioners or other members of the public .  As the policemen and women themselves <head>note</head> , these tasks are really forms of public relations ( FN 20/6/87 , p. 13 ) . Under this category there are also requests for assistance which amount to acts of community welfare ,  such as calls to lift aged and disabled people on to and off the toilet as well as into bed ,  and calls from very distressed pensioners and young children concerning lost pets  ( on the police as a social service see Punch 1979b ;  Punch and Naylor 1973 )  .  Nothing much can be done about missing pets ,  but the impression of diligence and earnestness they leave with the bereft alone is a comfort .

Given the particular disposition of the policeman or woman and the nature of the case ,  court duty can become an opportunity for them to have a good fight ,  and pleasure can be taken in getting one over the solicitor .  This also appears to be an attraction to members of British police forces .  Holdaway ( 1983 : 72 ) <head>noted</head> how lawyers were seen by Hilton 's police as a threat because they unmask police practice , and , along with doctors and social workers , they were considered challengers . This led some policemen to enjoy the sport which the court room offered  ( Holdaway 1983 :  74 )  .  In the case of policemen at Easton ,  this sport is situationally constrained by the common - sense knowledge they build up of the court room setting and its players .

But there are what they refer to as the problem families .  Again ,  they operate with similar typifications of who constitute the troublesome clients ,  based partly on experience but also heavily influenced by stereotypes of the educationally subnormal ,  one - parent families ,  families in whom historically crime runs ,  and so on .  As Furlong <head>noted</head> with respect to teachers ( 1977 : 163 ) , their typifications of problem pupils were also heavily conditioned by specialist sociological knowledge ( from socially deprived families ) or common - sense notions of psychoanalysis ( never had a father ) . These stereotypes can become deployed to explain persistent offending among the young even when there is little evidence that they are appropriate .  Backgrounds can therefore be reconstructed for the problem child in which their persistent offending becomes understandable .

The peasants in the Roslavl ' region did come in for some attention during 1922 ,  though supervision was at best paternalistic ,  sporadic ,  and myopic .  In January 1922 the town Party committee observed that there was no anti - Bolshevik agitation amongst the local clergy ,  the main focus of possible rural discontent .  It was <head>noted</head> however that what was contemptuously called the village intelligentsia still maintained a hostile attitude to the Party and the Red Army . At the end of February news filtered in that no peasants were willing to join the military ranks ,  and there were quite a few desertions .  The  greater part of the required prodnalog   ( tax in kind )  had been collected ,  but several villages were fractious due to silly actions by some officials .

Village clerks could not keep a proper record of deaths ,  since they were so frequent .  This was the source of the central authorities '  difficulty in making adequate assessments .

In Indian famines of which he had long experience ,  only landless labourers and smaller cultivators  the submerged tenth  needed relief .

Since peasants who still possessed any seed reserves or livestock were excluded from relief ,  they were compelled to sell them off in some cases in order to survive .  This depleted the famine areas further ,  and sparked off new hatred amongst the peasants .  In the subsequent scramble for survival and enrichment which mounted towards the end of 1922 , it was not surprising that those who were slightly better off often took a kind of revenge in driving hard bargains with their poorer neighbours , as has been <head>noted</head> earlier . The intermediary between local bodies and Moscow were the guberniia Commissions for the Relief of the Starving .  The  Tsaritsyn Commission was set up on 8 August 192 1 ,  and like its counterparts in other gubernii ,  were very closely modelled on Pomgol ,  the all - Russian organ in Moscow .

The real essence of Thatcherism ,  indeed ,  lay not so much in its ideas ,  which proved to be increasingly malleable as the years went by ,  and especially when Nigel Lawson took over the Treasury in  1984 .  It lay rather in the company it kept ,  the classes with which it was associated .  As <head>noted</head> , Mrs Thatcher came from a relatively humble , unprivileged background , though a degree at Oxford and later marriage to a millionaire businessman gave her a distinctly haut bourgeois status in time . But her outlook was subtly different ,  say from that of Edward Heath ,  whose father was a carpenter in a small town in Kent and who ,  like Mrs Thatcher ,  went to a local grammar school rather than the private boarding schools favoured by most Tory leaders .  The Heath background was one of constructive ,  but deferential ,  working - class Toryism .

Here is a most revealing instance of the way a difference within the same ,  teleologically construed ,  can make a great deal of difference :  in effect a difference of degree can be as real as  a difference of kind but in a different way :  the lesser is inferior and thereby inimical in a way the antithetical cannot be ,  and the same becomes more ditferent than difference itself .  But never utterly  i.e. securely  other  .  Perhaps this helps explain something <head>noted</head> by Laura Levine : in the numerous tracts attacking the Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre and its dress and gender transgressions , there is a fear that men dressing as women will lead to an erosion of masculinity itself . Levine contends that these tracts ,  even as they confidently sermonize on the fixed nature of identity ,  especially gender identity as prescribed by God and signified through dress difference ,  display a deep anxiety that identity is not  fixed ;  that ,  underneath ,  the self is really nothing at all  ( Men in Women 's  Clothing ,  126 and 128 )  .  Further ,  they feared that doing what a woman does  ( on the stage and in women 's  clothes )  leads to being what a woman is ;  the most unmanageable anxiety is that there is no essentially masculine self  ( p. 1 36 )  ,  and cross - dressing in women 's  clothes can lead to a man turning into a woman .

Rainoldes apart ,  the transgressions associated with the boy players ,  be they actual or imagined ,  rendered the theatrical self - consciousness surrounding transvestism complex and shifting ;  it provoked questions teasingly unanswerable :  for example  and this is a question which remains intriguing for us today  which ,  or how many ,  of the several gender identities embodied in any one figure are in play at any one time ?  There were factors at play in the association of theatrical cross - dressing and sexual transgressions .  Not only did prostitutes frequent the theatre , but the street transvestite was sometimes associated with prostitution and possibly sodomy : Henriques <head>notes</head> a regulation dating from 1480 forbidding prostitutes to dress as men in public , and remarks : This masquerading presumably would have meant an added inducement to sodomy ( Prostitution and Society , ii . 88 )  .  It he is right ,  then stage transgressions seemed to have spoken to immediate temptations in diverse ways .

The final report of the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth drew attention to the stability in the distribution of income in the post - war period .  Some redistribution had occurred between 1938 and 1949 ,  but if one ignores the top 1 per cent of income earners ,  there had been little change up to 1979 .  Under the Conservative government , as <head>noted</head> , the tax system became less progressive , with the major reductions being made at the top end of the tax range and there were increases in national insurance and the nonprogressive indirect taxes . The tax cuts for the top income earners ,  the increase in share prices over the decade ,  and the effects of the recession have sharpened economic differentials in the Thatcher period .  Although the Commission was dissolved  in 1979 ,  the 1985 volume of Inland Revenue Annual Statistics found that between 1979 and 1983 the most wealthy 50 per cent of the adult population increased its share of total marketable wealth from 79  83 per cent to 80  4 per cent .

Mrs Thatcher 's  governments were determined to cut the unions down in size and ,  for all the incremental nature of the legislation ,  prepared the ground in advance .

If they are  including public - sector trade unions ,  local government ,  local authority schools and housing ,  and various quangoes  then they attract little sympathy and people have to be liberated from them .

These stages were based on productive technology .  For example ,  hunters and gatherers were placed low while irrigating cultivators were placed high ,  then these activities were linked directly with such institutions as rules concerning property ,  the status of women ,  the type of government ,  and the kinship system .  In this , Ancient Society resembled the other evolutionary schemes for the history of mankind which we have just <head>noted</head> . However ,  Ancient Society  also differed from earlier work because of the high quality of the scholarly work on which it was based ,  because of the sympathy of the writer for primitives ,  and because it not only defined stages but in many cases suggested mechanisms which explained why one stage should change to another .  This last element ,  perhaps more than any other ,  is crucial for understanding why Marx and Engels attached so much more importance to the work of Morgan than they did to the work of the other evolutionist anthropologists whom they read .

Anthropology and the work of Morgan were harnessed to the political task of rewriting history .  There was another political task to which anthropology was put in the work of Marx ,  and for this the writings of Morgan also proved particularly appropriate .  The use of anthropology which we have already <head>noted</head> can be called historical . Marx and Engels were interested in primitive cultures because they wanted to construct a general history and theory of society in order to explain the coming to be of capitalism .

This second and logically distinct ,  rhetorical use of anthropological material is never completely separate from the historical use ,  and the mixture of the two became ,  as we shall see ,  the source of many problems .  The rhetorical use of anthropology inevitably involved Marx and Engels in a search of the anthropological literature for examples  of opposites to the institutions of capitalism .  Since their work focused on certain topics it was natural that they particularly looked for evidence relating to these topics , and as examples of the rhetorical use of anthropology three such central topics can be <head>noted</head> here in a preliminary way . These are the relationships existing between people engaged in the process of production ,  the relations of production ,  property and the family .  Marx 's  work in Capital  is focused on the nature of the social relationship which existed between workers and capitalists :  the capitalist relations of production .

According to the theory ,  the people who used such a system of terms did not themselves ,  however ,  practise such a type of marriage but actually practices the next stage .  This was because according to Morgan kin terms lag behind .  As a result , the evidence for this second stage in the history of marriage depends entirely on the two assumptions which we have already <head>noted</head> . One that patterns of kin terms indicate types of marriage ,  and second ,  that the presence of such a pattern is a guide to a previous  state of affairs .  The Polynesians ,  according to this way of seeing things ,  had a system of kinship terms ,  which indicated ,  not the marriage system which they practised ,  but the marriage system which they had practised in the past .

Engels re - echoes The German Ideology  in showing that far from the State being the repository of justice ,  it is the repository of exploitation ,  but here he does this by use of genuine anthropological materials .  According to Engels the State only develops with the full elaboration of classes ,  and it is the tool of the ruling class enforcing its will on those whom it oppresses .  This is a crucial proposition which we have already <head>noted</head> and which will be discussed again later in this book . It is by means of this idea that the State is linked with the earlier part of the origin of kinship and marriage .  Classes and private property grow out of the family and together these various factors lead to the break - up of the gens .

Admittedly if the component family abandons its claim to the land this will revert to the commonality but that does not mean that there are no such claims in normal circumstances .  In other words ,  a declaration of common ownership of the land of the gens does not imply free and equal access to all within the gens .  Marx , in particular , had already <head>noted</head> this fact in several places , but he explained the phenomenon of internal division as a transitional one ; as evidence of a stage in which private property and individual families were coming in and undermining the communal descent group . A problem with this point of view is that there is in fact no evidence of descent groups having ever  existed without these two levels and it seems difficult to treat all documented cases as transitions from a stage for which there is no evidence .  In any case ,  the contradiction which Marx stresses very largely disappears when we realize that it is a matter of the context in which claim to land is expressed .

Finally ,  since there is no simple correlation between high status for women and matriliny and since there is no simple connection between matriliny and type of technology ,  it follows that there is no simple connection between primitive technology and high status for women .  Among living hunters and gatherers ,  women may have a comparatively high status as amongst the Mbuti of Africa ,  or a comparatively low status among most Australian Aborigines The issue is far more complicated and it is only fair to <head>note</head> that we have not reached a stage of knowledge when we can easily say what explains the status of women among the different peoples of the world . The status of women has several aspects which themselves do not go simple together .  By and large the evidence which Engels and his contemporaries saw as significant of the high status of women in primitive societies is often wrong or does not signify what it was believed to mean .

The release of growth hormone  ( fig 3.2 )  is dominated by external factors rather than the body clock and is linked to the electrical changes in the brain associated with deep sleep .

It is interesting to <head>note</head> that severe physical exercise in the daytime is sometimes associated with increased deep sleep the following night ; perhaps there is a link here between deep sleep , an increase in growth hormone release , and the growth of muscular tissue that is produced by exercise .

These include cortisol  ( which rises later in the night as the body prepares for waking and is strongly influenced by the body clock )  ;  antidiuretic hormone  ( which is one of the ways in which fluid formation by the kidney is reduced at night ,  see Chapter 6 )  ;  and the male sex hormone ,  testosterone ,  as well as some of the hormones that control the reproductive cycle in women .

Even where a bituminous felt layer was laid on top of the boarding ,  this form of construction is likely to compound problems of rainwater penetration once a gap appears in the roof covering because the water which enters ,  instead of draining out of the construction at the eaves ,  settles on the upper edges of the local slate - fixing battens ,  inducing rot both in them and the boarding .  Equally bad from the point of view of damp exclusion in the circumstance of a breach appearing in the roof surface ,  and even worse in terms of the restrictions it places on the opportunities for salvaging slates in any wholesale reconditioning of the roof covering ,  is the arrangement in which the slates are nailed directly to boarding ,  no fixing battens having been incorporated .  If this form of construction cannot be identified from an inspection of voids in the roof surface made from the exterior , it may be possible to deduce whether or not it applies by <head>noting</head> the pattern of nails which have penetrated into the roof - space through the boarding . Such an inspection should also help to identify any dampness or rot which has affected the boarding .

Preliminary steps taken to conduct studies on trade ,  technology and investment flows in the region may seem insignificant .  But Mr Baker plainly views it as otherwise .  He <head>noted</head> that the Canberra meeting is the start of something which could grow into a very significant development not only for the region but for the global economy . If the more economically puny ASEAN countries  ( Indonesia ,  Malaysia ,  Singapore ,  Brunei ,  Thailand and the Philippines )  were to bury their reservations ,  then the high growth from other partners ,  including such tigers as Thailand and South Korea alongside the more mature economies of Japan and Australia ,  could mean a dynamic coalition .  It would then be up to the US and Canada to decide whether they want to face towards the Atlantic or Pacific  or be caught between two great trading oceans .

The ramshackle Whitley Council negotiating machinery is the other reason why the ambulance workers have lost out .  Until this year ,  the three independent review bodies which make recommendations for nurses ,  doctors and the professions allied to medicine have given much higher awards than the Whitley Councils .  As Lord McCarthy <head>noted</head> some 13 years ago , the management side of the councils comprise employers who do not pay and paymasters who do not employ . A much more flexible system which would allow local managers to negotiate local rates  on a national pay spine  is needed .  A crisis ;  an agenda for reform and honesty .

The question of whether the convictions were safe ,  and the need for a review to allay public anxiety in the light of the Guildford findings ,  is raised in a statement by the joint presidents of the Birmingham Council of Christian Churches :  the Most Reverend Maurice Couve de Murville ,  Archbishop of Birmingham ;  the Right Reverend Mark Santer ,  Bishop of Birmingham ;  and the Reverend David Good ,  representing the Birmingham Free Churches .  They doubt whether the Court of Appeal would reach the same conclusion today as it had last year about the reliability of the convictions ,  since the Guildford case had raised questions on the adequacy of reviews of possible wrongful conviction .  They also <head>note</head> that an inquiry is being conducted into alleged malpractice by the serious crime squad of the West Midlands force . Justice is not served by even the slightest suspicion of injustice ,  the Rt Rev Santer said yesterday .  Twenty - one people were killed and 167 injured in the explosions at two Birmingham city centre pubs in 1974 .

The announcment appeared timed for sessions of the Estonian and the Latvian parliaments which began in their respective capitals ,  Tallinn and Riga ,  yesterday .  However ,  with parts of the new Soviet constitution not yet in place ,  it was not immediately clear how  if at all  the Soviet leadership could enforce such a ruling if the republics refused to toe the line .  Tass said the Praesidium of the Supreme Soviet <head>noted</head> at its meeting yesterday a considerable activisation of legislative activity by republican parliaments in recent times . The Praesidium ,  headed by President Gorbachev ,  said many of these laws were aimed at strengthening the economic and political independence and ensuring the rights and freedoms of citizens .  But ,  at the same time ,  some legislative acts of Azerbaijan ,  Latvia ,  Lithuania and Estonia contain norms which do not correspond to the constitution of the Soviet Union and contravene its international agreements ,  Tass said .
