He labours scornfully for this Simon Giles ,  faintly comforted by a corner in Classical studies which has been granted him for reasons to do with the firm 's  image .  Between Patrick and Mrs Giles there flows ,  or gutters ,  a current of dreary sexual electricity .  He fancies that Simon is Jewish , and that he gives off a slight <head>hot</head> smell . We are later tolerantly informed  in the presiding idiom of the book ,  by a narrator keen ,  as ever ,  to monitor Patrick 's  impressions  that the smell was not atrocious :  not strong but easily perceptible ,  like a large zoo passed at a distance .  By then ,  however ,  Patrick  has been informed ,  by an office placeman and fuddy - duddy who believes that trendiness has ruined everything ,  that smelly Simon ,  though he may be obnoxious ,  is not Jewish .

The beans have now reached the top of their 6ft canes and I 'm praying that any autumn gales will be delayed until the beans are all safely harvested .

But the eventual consensus was that runner beans ,  which of course rely on insects for pollination ,  simply were n't getting enough attention from them .  In anticipation that the same problem might recur this summer I tried sowing some sweet peas with the runner beans .

Massed conifers cast dense shadows and their fallen needles can upset the acid/alkaline balance of the soil .  Some thinning may be necessary to admit enough light for plants such as rhododendrons ,  pieris and hostas to thrive .  Unless very dense , the shady conditions produced by most garden trees can be turned to advantage by creating a miniature woodland that will suit shade - loving plants and offer a cool oasis in a <head>hot</head> summer . Even branches from a neighbour 's  tree overhanging your garden can be exploited in this way .  With a little unobtrusive thinning ,  you can regulate the amount of dappled shade and filtered sunlight to suit the kind of plants you would like to grow .

I had a similar problem when I wanted to rout a decorative edge around small components .

The scrap was then clamped in the vice ,  and the routing was easy .  The final procedure was to split off the component from the scrap and clean up.

A Raw linseed oil is lighter in colour than the boiled variety but they are both used in wood finishing .

It is particularly suitable for table tops on account of its ability to withstand accidental spillages and does not blister when <head>hot</head> dishes are placed on it . Either raw or boiled oil may be used .  Raw linseed may be better on light coloured woods because its darkening effect is less than boiled oil .

CATERING THE 1980s opened with British Transport Hotels  ( BTH )  still running around thirty traditional railway hotels ;  with its Travellers - Fare wing sprucing up its portfolio of dull ,  old - fashioned refreshment rooms ,  and restaurant cars continuing to suffer declining patronage as journey times shortened and eating habits changed .  The HSTs had effected one major positive change : an increase in <head>hot</head> snacks in the age of the microwave . The decade ended with the railway hotels not merely privatised but in many cases under second and third owners ,  generally poorer in standard and distinctly without the nation  having benefited  ( since they ran at a profit anyway )  ,  with Travellers - Fare privatised and healthier  ( both profitwise and in what they served )  ,  and with InterCity rethinking the role of the restaurant car and with many chefs still preparing meals on board .  It was in station catering ,  so long the Cinderella ,  that the changed order of the 1980s made its first mark .

In a maltings the grain is allowed to germinate ,  with roots breaking through the husk of the barley ,  and is then heated in a kiln to produce a pale or darker malt according to the brewer 's  needs .  In the brewery the malt is ground into a coarse powder called grist .  It is thoroughly mixed in a large vessel called a mash tun with <head>hot</head> pure water . The sugars dissolve into the water and the sweet liquid ,  called wort ,  is pumped to a copper .  The flowers of the hop plant add bitterness to beer and the oils in the plant also guard against any infections during the brewing process .

During normal brewing with leaf hops these flavours are released rapidly into the <head>hot</head> wort and are often appreciated in the vicinity of the brewery during boiling . In addition hops provide bitterness as well as flavour .  Bitterness is contributed by chemicals called iso -  a  acids .

In 1984 ,  foresters found that 20 per cent of the Norway spruce in West Germany 's  forests had lost more than a quarter of their needles .  By 1988 this had dropped to about 15 per cent of spruce ,  and other species such as pine and fir showed similar improvements .  In other words , the symptoms were at their worst during the <head>hot</head> , dry summers of the early Eighties and started to improve in subsequent wet summers . It is ,  cynics might say ,  exactly the conclusion one would expect from scientists in the pay of the CEGB .  However ,  Mike Roberts ,  now director of the Natural Environment Research Council 's  Institute of Terrestrial Ecology  ( South )  ,  is quick to point out that acid deposition does exacerbate the problem ,  in particular by washing magnesium from an already nutrient - poor soil .

I gazed upwards and could see a few stars twinkling in the sky ,  one seemed much brighter than the others .  You see that star ,  Taff See how much brighter it is .  I looked at Taff sitting opposite me in the gloom , his hands wrapped around his <head>hot</head> mug of tea , his shoulders hunched forward . He was silent for a few moments ,  then he raised his head ,  took a couple of gulps of tea and remarked very slowly ,  Jesus Christ ,  Piper ,  you must be bloody bomb happy !  We are all living in holes in the ground having all kinds of shit thrown at us and all you can talk about is one star being brighter than the others .

There was a cry ,  followed shortly by a pounding of feet past the trench and down through the orchard ,  then silence ,  except for a rumble of artillery somewhere in the distance .  At 6 a.m. the mortar team started to drum up for breakfast .  I waited until the tea was ready then joined them for a warming meal of steak and kidney pudding , followed by a very <head>hot</head> mug of tea into which was placed a measure of Navy rum . Yesterday the spirits and beer ration had reached us ;  rum for the Officers and beer for the other ranks ,  but as we were all involved in the war ,  everything was shared .  As I crouched against the wall which offered some  protection against the rain ,  the mortar team Corporal got up from the grass where he had been sitting and ,  crossing over to the small pile of H.E.

Penny for your thoughts ,  Piper ,  the Corporal remarked .  Just enjoying the taste of the rum ,  Corporal ,  I replied ,  getting to my feet and swilling out the mess - tins and empty mug as I made my way through the drizzle to my now very muddy slit trench .

There was no more talking from the Germans ,  and no more mortaring ,  the remaining part of the night passed fairly quickly with no further signs of tiredness as we lay and listened .  As dawn came up in the sky we made preparations to move back to our own lines ,  covering our withdrawal and keeping careful watch for any signs of the enemy .  After a <head>hot</head> mess - tin full of oxtail soup , I was more than ready to get into any old slit trench to have some desperately needed sleep . As I curled up. in the rear of the trench ,  wrapped myself in an old Army blanket ,  I could hear the sound of the German sniping starting up for the day .

We are later tolerantly informed  in the presiding idiom of the book ,  by a narrator keen ,  as ever ,  to monitor Patrick 's  impressions  that the smell was not atrocious :  not strong but easily perceptible ,  like a large zoo passed at a distance .  By then ,  however ,  Patrick  has been informed ,  by an office placeman and fuddy - duddy who believes that trendiness has ruined everything ,  that smelly Simon ,  though he may be obnoxious ,  is not Jewish .

The beans have now reached the top of their 6ft canes and I 'm praying that any autumn gales will be delayed until the beans are all safely harvested .

But the eventual consensus was that runner beans ,  which of course rely on insects for pollination ,  simply were n't getting enough attention from them .

Massed conifers cast dense shadows and their fallen needles can upset the acid/alkaline balance of the soil .  Some thinning may be necessary to admit enough light for plants such as rhododendrons ,  pieris and hostas to thrive .  Unless very dense , the shady conditions produced by most garden trees can be turned to advantage by creating a miniature woodland that will suit shade - loving plants and offer a cool oasis in a <head>hot</head> summer . Even branches from a neighbour 's  tree overhanging your garden can be exploited in this way .  With a little unobtrusive thinning ,  you can regulate the amount of dappled shade and filtered sunlight to suit the kind of plants you would like to grow .

When Mary came out ,  she found him standing still with his back to the sun ,  looking down the river towards the shady woodlands round Grandtully .

Aaron the priest was thus the spokesman ,  even though the authority was that of Moses .  )  The temple ritual turned out to be of passing significance to Judaism .

By AD 70 ,  that fateful year of Roman conquest and  banishment ,  the temple had fallen for good ,  and the classic priestly ritual was no more .  Never again ,  except in the nostalgic hopefulness of a few  would the ceremonies be performed ;  gone were the offerings ,  the blood - shedding ,  the fire and incense ,  the gorgeous  ( and the plain )  robes ,  and the rest of the sacred imagery which fenced - off God 's  otherness from the people  and brought them close to him in awe and penitence .

I had a similar problem when I wanted to rout a decorative edge around small components .  I could n't hold the component in a sash cramp ,  itself held in the vice ,  because the bearing at the base of the router fouled the sash cramp .  I eventually solved the problem by two small blobs of <head>hot</head> stick glue which temporarily glued the component to a scrap piece of wood , dimensioned so that the component overhung the scrap all around . The scrap was then clamped in the vice ,  and the routing was easy .  The final procedure was to split off the component from the scrap and clean up.

In the softer areas it worked like a <head>hot</head> knife through butter and large areas could be removed , shaped or modelled in an astonishingly short time , in comparison with traditional mallet and gouges . I felt that on this particular piece it did struggle through the heartwood at times ,  especially on the figure 's  right - hand side as this was extremely hard in places ,  with dense interlocking grain where a branch or branches had formed .  It soon became obvious that I was probably pushing the cutter and grinder too hard and had to adjust my force .

A Raw linseed oil is lighter in colour than the boiled variety but they are both used in wood finishing .  Oil polishing is a lengthy and strenuous process which brings out the beauty of the wood like no other finish and imparts a most durable ,  dull sheen .  It is particularly suitable for table tops on account of its ability to withstand accidental spillages and does not blister when <head>hot</head> dishes are placed on it . Either raw or boiled oil may be used .  Raw linseed may be better on light coloured woods because its darkening effect is less than boiled oil .

CATERING THE 1980s opened with British Transport Hotels  ( BTH )  still running around thirty traditional railway hotels ;  with its Travellers - Fare wing sprucing up its portfolio of dull ,  old - fashioned refreshment rooms ,  and restaurant cars continuing to suffer declining patronage as journey times shortened and eating habits changed .  The HSTs had effected one major positive change : an increase in <head>hot</head> snacks in the age of the microwave . The decade ended with the railway hotels not merely privatised but in many cases under second and third owners ,  generally poorer in standard and distinctly without the nation  having benefited  ( since they ran at a profit anyway )  ,  with Travellers - Fare privatised and healthier  ( both profitwise and in what they served )  ,  and with InterCity rethinking the role of the restaurant car and with many chefs still preparing meals on board .  It was in station catering ,  so long the Cinderella ,  that the changed order of the 1980s made its first mark .

In a maltings the grain is allowed to germinate ,  with roots breaking through the husk of the barley ,  and is then heated in a kiln to produce a pale or darker malt according to the brewer 's  needs .

The sugars dissolve into the water and the sweet liquid ,  called wort ,  is pumped to a copper .  The flowers of the hop plant add bitterness to beer and the oils in the plant also guard against any infections during the brewing process .

In 1984 ,  foresters found that 20 per cent of the Norway spruce in West Germany 's  forests had lost more than a quarter of their needles .  By 1988 this had dropped to about 15 per cent of spruce ,  and other species such as pine and fir showed similar improvements .  In other words , the symptoms were at their worst during the <head>hot</head> , dry summers of the early Eighties and started to improve in subsequent wet summers . It is ,  cynics might say ,  exactly the conclusion one would expect from scientists in the pay of the CEGB .  However ,  Mike Roberts ,  now director of the Natural Environment Research Council 's  Institute of Terrestrial Ecology  ( South )  ,  is quick to point out that acid deposition does exacerbate the problem ,  in particular by washing magnesium from an already nutrient - poor soil .

The careful ,  thorough examination continues :  each charge in the pamphlet complained of is brought out and evenly dismissed .  Do you have the blood of 70,000 men ,  women and children on your hands ?   Certainly not. The <head>hot</head> - air hand - drier was almost certainly invented by lawyers : instead of the quick , rough efficiency of a towel , you must stand there miming the washing of hands over and over again until the soap has been extracted from every last crevice . This is very much the way in which the law approaches the extraction of the truth ,  and it is different both from the vivid imprecision of ordinary life and the intimacy of a police interrogation .  Above all ,  the questions to be decided in a libel case stand at a curious tangent to the stories that lead up to them .

The best - known is Les Grands Sables ,  over a mile long and backed by cliffs where the gorse - bushes were explosions of butter - yellow fireworks .  On the Cote Sauvage is Port - Donant ,  where the surf is exciting and sometimes dangerous .  It is popular with summer bathers , but at other times the water is cold and the fine sand dotted with jellyfish like complicated <head>hot</head> - weather dishes : semi - transparent yellow - streaked boeuf en daube and deep magenta grape aspic . The central part of the island seemed at first to belong to another and less dramatic world .  We passed gently rolling pastures where fat sheep and cows grazed ,  empty dusty roads edged with white convolvulus and daisies ,  and fields of grain rippling in the soft wind like beige velvet stroked by an invisible hand .

Nowadays the bourgeoisie is more likely to patronise the city 's  luxurious food and clothes shops ,  all housed in the medieval streets .  The oldest tavern is the Vlissinghe ,  of which mention was first made in 1552 ,  but there are hundreds of little bars and cafes ,  many of them housed in olde - worlde buildings that have the Americans squealing with delight .  Plenty have terraces from which to watch the world go by accompanied by a <head>hot</head> waffle or a glass of beer . There were once 40 breweries in Bruges ,  and although now there are only two ,  the choice of Belgian beers is still enormous .  One cafe lists 300 .

MICKY STEWART ,  the England manager ,  gave his son ,  Alec ,  a gruelling introduction to cricket on the Indian sub - continent when he put the Surrey wicketkeeper - batsmen  along with the rest of the 14 - man England squad  -  through a three - and - a - half hour training session in temperatures of up to 100F at the National Stadium in Delhi yesterday .  Just a short sprint leaves you struggling for breath ,  said the younger Stewart ,  on his first tour with England .  Can you imagine what it 's like when it 's really <head>hot</head> out here ? England ,  who have arranged two practice games against local sides later this week ,  play their first match in the six - team Nehru Trophy against Sri Lanka on Sunday .  Australia ,  India ,  Pakistan and the West Indies complete the line - up for the one - day competition .

The prosecution alleged that the men had been responsible of 222 acts of terrorism which it then reduced to 193 .  The defendants admitted 20 ,  thereby conceding the government 's  main case .  The trial ground on through the long <head>hot</head> summer in Pretoria . It drew to an end in April 1964 with Mr Mandela 's  four - hour speech from the dock ,  in which he defended the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe and said he had done what he did for the ideal of a free and democratic society ,  an ideal for which I am prepared to die .  The only question was whether they would indeed be executed .

He came back later to claim another victim and the hosts were dismissed for 126 with 5.2 overs remaining .  It was a pleasing performance after just two days practice over here ,  Micky Stewart ,  the England manager ,  said .  It gave everyone a good introduction as to what we can expect the weather was <head>hot</head> and the pitch typically flat . The only disappointment for the tourists was captain Graham Gooch 's  failure .  He fell for eight ,  bowled by 22 - year - old welfare officer ,  Srinivasan .

The only difference was that the mortar bursts were further away than yesterday ,  some were even landing in the village .  The sniping was still fairly accurate and still concentrated in and around the orchard .  Someone brought me a mess tin half full of very <head>hot</head> tea ; it tasted good . Looking down towards the Orne I could see a thick mist over the water and patches of mist hanging over the cornfields .  Commandos were now moving about the road in front of the farmhouse .

How are things at 6 Commando area ,  Piper ?  he enquired ,  The attack by the Black Watch has not gone too well judging by the number of wounded passing through here !  A flare lit up the sky as Taff was talking ,  casting eerie shadows among the trees .  I got into the trench and opened my tin of soup , pouring the piping <head>hot</head> liquid into a mess tin . You 're right ,  Taff .  The attacking troops are certainly not getting it all their own way and the shelling from both sides is causing casualties in the Commando positions .

I gazed upwards and could see a few stars twinkling in the sky ,  one seemed much brighter than the others .  You see that star ,  Taff See how much brighter it is .  I looked at Taff sitting opposite me in the gloom , his hands wrapped around his <head>hot</head> mug of tea , his shoulders hunched forward . He was silent for a few moments ,  then he raised his head ,  took a couple of gulps of tea and remarked very slowly ,  Jesus Christ ,  Piper ,  you must be bloody bomb happy !  We are all living in holes in the ground having all kinds of shit thrown at us and all you can talk about is one star being brighter than the others .

There was a cry ,  followed shortly by a pounding of feet past the trench and down through the orchard ,  then silence ,  except for a rumble of artillery somewhere in the distance .  At 6 a.m. the mortar team started to drum up for breakfast .  I waited until the tea was ready then joined them for a warming meal of steak and kidney pudding , followed by a very <head>hot</head> mug of tea into which was placed a measure of Navy rum . Yesterday the spirits and beer ration had reached us ;  rum for the Officers and beer for the other ranks ,  but as we were all involved in the war ,  everything was shared .  As I crouched against the wall which offered some  protection against the rain ,  the mortar team Corporal got up from the grass where he had been sitting and ,  crossing over to the small pile of H.E.

Penny for your thoughts ,  Piper ,  the Corporal remarked .  Just enjoying the taste of the rum ,  Corporal ,  I replied ,  getting to my feet and swilling out the mess - tins and empty mug as I made my way through the drizzle to my now very muddy slit trench .  By noon the rain had stopped and already the trees and grass in the orchard were almost dry as the <head>hot</head> sun shone through the leaves . Hello there ,  Piper .  Fancy a run down to the river Orne to collect some water ?

There was no more talking from the Germans ,  and no more mortaring ,  the remaining part of the night passed fairly quickly with no further signs of tiredness as we lay and listened .  As dawn came up in the sky we made preparations to move back to our own lines ,  covering our withdrawal and keeping careful watch for any signs of the enemy .  After a <head>hot</head> mess - tin full of oxtail soup , I was more than ready to get into any old slit trench to have some desperately needed sleep . As I curled up. in the rear of the trench ,  wrapped myself in an old Army blanket ,  I could hear the sound of the German sniping starting up for the day .

As my section settled into the straw - filled barn ,  I dumped the rucksack ,  and slinging  the rifle over my shoulder ,  went off in search of something to eat ,  coffee or whatever was going .  A few French Commandos were making their way across the farmyard in the direction of a large barn where it appeared that someone was attempting to prepare breakfast .  I joined the others with great anticipation , of , possibly , <head>hot</head> coffee , French bread , maybe fried eggs awaited us in the barn . I could certainly smell coffee brewing .  All thoughts of tiredness had now gone as I prepared myself for breakfast and quickened my pace towards the barn .

But on the hill ,  crouched against a stone wall which may or may not be providing protection against wind - swept rain ,  such a dainty arrangement fast loses all its attraction .  In such conditions what is needed is something which will fill the hunger gap quickly and with as little movement as possible  when passing food through the little Niagara Falls running off the hood of my waterproof  deeply envied those astronauts who can squeeze a whole meal into their mouth from a plastic toothpaste tube .  Oh how I have longed sometimes to crouch with my head in my rucksack and give myself a squeeze of self - heating steak and kidney pudding , followed by a quick squeeze of <head>hot</head> custard and delicious spotted dick . But it is not just bad weather which takes the gilt off the packed - lunch gingerbread .  On those rare days when the weather has run out of rain and the sun has driven away the clouds ,  the wrong packed lunch can be just as disastrous .

I was now <head>hot</head> so we filled our water bottle and set off up the track towards to skyline .

My one reservation concerns their performance on wet rock  however I 've never found a sole that really grips well on it .  The uppers ,  made of one piece calf leather with leather bellows ,  well padded tongue and collar ,  provided the comfort I remembered from the first day .  I liked the soft Cambrelle lining which incorporates the new Molto pren ( MTP ) interliner it cushioned my feet without making the boots too <head>hot</head> or sweaty on a warm day . I found the ankle cuff the right height and shape to provide support without restricting my movement .  It is slightly cut away at the rear and so does n't put pressure on the Achilles tendon .
