From its domination by the old ascendancy ,  the Orange order in particular came to embrace protestants from all classes and churches .  In fact ,  in rural areas today ,  the Orange hall has frequently been the only place where protestants of all shades have met to renew their belief and commitment to Ulster protestant loyalism  ( Harris 1972 :  1625 )  .  It is important to note that these <head>organizations</head> are internally stratified . Those nearer the top ,  particularly in the Black Preceptory ,  the inner sanctum of the society structure ,  are there because of their moral and religious standing in the local community :  wealthy farmers ,  businessmen ,  good churchmen ,  or at least of known moral probity .  They tend to represent the religious as opposed to the rough end of the protestant spiritual spectrum .

The Roman catholic bishops supported the wording of the referendum and ,  as the referendum approached ,  said it was legitimate to oppose the amendment even if one was against abortion ,  which was in any case still immoral and was the direct taking of an innocent life  ( Irish Bishops '  Conference statement ,  quoted O'Carroll 1983 )  .

With hindsight it seems that the prevailing structures of police practice will remain as powerful as ever ,  for at a conference on policing at Bristol University  ( 1988 )  ,  the newly retired Sir Kenneth admitted that police culture had defeated many of his attempts to bring a new ethic to the managerial style during his reign as commissioner of the metropolis .  ANTHROPOLOGY FOR THE POLICE It seems relevant that anthropology be used at this time to contribute to the debate on policing , for since the 1964 Police Act and the preceding Royal Commission which was generated through concern over police practice , the <head>organization</head> has held an increasingly central place in the public imagination . Policing issues are never long out of the headlines  ( Chibnall 1977 )  ,  and this media obsession has been transmitted into a  wealth of analyses of policing  which have mostly been carried out by outside observers .  Indeed insider accounts have largely consisted of bland reminiscences in the style of my greatest arrests and cases and it has been left to investigative journalism to redress some unacceptable police activity ,  by calling attention to the limits and abuses of police authority ,  power ,  and accountability .

In 1979 ,  James Anderton ,  the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester ,  described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from seditionist interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy  ( Thompson 1979 :  380 )  .  In the light of such a polemic stand ,  it begs the question whether the revelation of how crime figures are manipulated by the police to sustain institutional beliefs  ( see Chapter 5 )  could be said to undermine democracy or be classified as sedition .  For Anderton vehemently rejects the idea of any internal evaluation which might explore the moralities or philosophies of policing : there is simply no room in the management and <head>organization</head> of police operations for vague , academic dissertations ( Police Review ; 90 , 19 November 1982 : 4684 ) . In his 1977 annual report ,  Sir David McNee ,  then commissioner of the Metropolitan Police ,  urged that the libertarian should beware .  In due course ,  his successor ,  Sir Kenneth Newman ,  echoed this anti - intellectual stance ,  when he warned insiders that policemen must remember that they are practitioners ,  not crusaders ;  theirs is to do ,  not to righteously philosophise  ( Police Journal  56 ,  No. 1  ( 1983 )  )  .

Such people are radically opposed to the idea of sociologists conducting research on the police and long for a return to a golden age when the proverbial veil of secrecy surrounded police work .

all totalitarian institutions  ( in Goffman 's  phrase )  embody their principles in an inexplicit way ,  beyond the grasp of consciousness and exhort the essential by an implicit pedagogy ,  capable of instilling a whole cosmology ,  an ethic ,  a political philosophy through injunctions as insignificant as stand up straight .  It is little wonder then that social research is equated with clap trap in police magazines ,  for they aim to support the beliefs of those who have taken on this unconscious cosmology ,  and for whom as Bourdieu  ( ibid .  )  indicates ,  such challenges would defy the most natural manifestations of submission to the established order and abolish lateral possibilities .

The nation - wide state publishing <head>organization</head> , Gosizdat , was responsible for the dissemination of official literature of all kinds , but the flow of materials to the provinces remained very weak even as late as 1923 .

None of them made a special selection of materials suitable for the peasantry ,  so the few books that were dispatched were often too dry or too expensive .

The arrogance of Bolshevik - inspired youth towards the patriarchal rural community also transpires from other criticisms directed against younger visitors .  But peasants also complained when what they called doctors came out to inspect their cattle and sanitary arrangements ,  or when two peasants who had murdered their wives had to be handed over to a visiting social court  (  obshchestvennyi sud  )  set up by a shefstvo team .  The party 's myopic concentration on the kind of agricultural <head>organizations</head> it wished to nurture for the future is also shown in the frequent reports for 1922 on the fragile co - operative network . These efforts proved to be in vain for the most part .  By the middle of 1924 the Agitprop section of the Smolgubkom  was openly declaring that both shefstvo and smychka were a farce in actuality because they had deteriorated into mass weekend outings to the countryside in search of illicit stills .

Here ,  as so often when one penetrates to particulars ,  the rigid historiographical divisions  ( War Communism ,  NEP ,  the Five - Year Plan years )  crumble .  In our survey of the financial arrangements of NEP as they applied to the Smolensk guberniia ,  it was noted how they were unstable and poorly defined from the outset ,  leading to economic and social tensions at the lower levels .  Right from its inception NEP carried within itself the germs of its own fatal illness , whether one looks at its fiscal <head>organization</head> or the economic persona ( like these Nepmen ) which it soon evoked , or in many cases re - awakened . It is true that high - level Bolshevik theorists in Moscow and Petrograd tended to select ,  filter ,  and interpret evidence from the localities in the light of their prevailing general beliefs ,  so that their conclusions had little foundation in hard evidence .  Yet although Yakovlev was one of their kind ,  his factual findings show little sign of conscious or unconscious censorship or exclusion .

When the Soviet sent the militia to the colony in order to accuse the inmates of robbing peasants ,  Makarenko sent even it packing .  He showed the same scant respect for other agents of central power .  His opinion of the local Komsomol was no doubt coloured by the fact that his own colony was a kind of rival <head>organization</head> , but his view broadly reflects that of Yakovlev on the Nikol 'skaia Komsomol ; Yakovlev was a more disinterested outsider . Makarenko wrote :  The local Young Communists were very weak in both number and quality .  They were far too interested in girls and vodka ,  and they had a rather negative influence on the colonists .

They were far too interested in girls and vodka ,  and they had a rather negative influence on the colonists .  Soviet historians have subsequently tried to cover over this situation .  They have written that It is well known that the great Soviet pedagogue , A. S. Makarenko , succeeded in forming a genuine Soviet collective of charges only after a Komsomol <head>organization</head> was established in his colony . In reality ,  a Komsomol political instructor  ( with a criminal record )  entered the colony in 1925 ,  well after Makarenko had established discipline .  This Komsomol representation apparently played no role in the subsequent administration of the colony .

Yet we cannot take foreign accounts at their face value either .  Political propaganda on the part of the American Relief Administration ,  by far the longest foreign source of aid ,  warped its judgement at the time ,  and the subsequent polarization of Russian - American relations has not improved the objectivity of later scholarly accounts of the Famine as seen through American eyes .  Even F. Nansen , the esteemed Norwegian co - ordinator of many other foreign relief <head>organizations</head> , could on occasion be carried away by his emotions and give a semi - fictional account of conditions in the Volga provinces . Calm assessments were hard to come by in the shadow of a tragedy of such proportions .  A native Russian of genius ,  L. Tolstoy ,  had been blinded by his feelings in the famine of  18912 when he made mildly inaccurate statements about the Tsarist relief administration .

Due to wartime conditions the peasantry got the same amount of agricultural machinery over the years 191521 that they had been able to buy in a single year prior to the World War .  They had suffered in the Civil War from requisitioning by Red ,  White ,  and Green armies ,  and to some extent from the Bolshevik - inspired kombedy   ( committees of poor peasants )  .  As the Famine grew , poor co - operation between the Soviet authorities and foreign relief groups , and amongst the foreign <head>organizations</head> themselves , exacerbated the situation . The worst aspects  of co - ordination ,  however ,  were central - local relations within the Soviet hierarchy .  We will return to this later ,  but at this point the course of the Famine needs to be related very briefly .

At this point we can embark on an investigation of the spatial or horizontal effects of the Famine in 1922 .  Internal movement within the worst - affected areas should be looked at first .  Those peasants who continued to own draught animals had lent them to relief <head>organizations</head> at the height of the Famine , but by the spring of 1922 they refused to do this any longer , since they now found many profitable uses for them . Owners of draught animals had a virtual monopoly oh the transport of grain to the miller ,  the market ,  and the local collection - point for the tax in kind .  If the tax was paid promptly ,  a discount was given .

Certainly suspect committee members had attempted to go abroad ,  but the real reason was probably that the committee had served its purpose by acting as a bait to attract foreign relief organizations  ( the ARA drew up an agreement on 20 August )  .  Alternatively the committee could have served as a scapegoat if Pomgol activities had failed completely .  Since all foreign relief <head>organizations</head> dealt with Pomgol and with Eiduk as chief plenipotentiary , subsequent non - Russian scholars have tended to over - concentrate on the workings of Pomgol and its guberniia equivalents . Yet Pomgol was little more than a conglomerate made up of other relevant state departments .  The Commissariat of Agriculture was the key element within Pomgol .

Gosplan and other central economic organs from 1921 on had accumulated on paper a number of plans for reconstruction which they were now eager to realize .  As in the recent past ,  and as was to be the case with much greater frequency after the start of the Five - Year Plans ,  planners in Moscow drew up neat and rather abstract formulations that did not match up closely with local realities and timings .  Foreign relief <head>organizations</head> and subsequent students of their work have tended to exaggerate this dichotomy with regard to the Famine , but internal Soviet sources lend credence to the view that the sudden withdrawal of many kinds of domestic relief was premature . In 1922 it was not so easy to predict crop yields as it is today .  In that sense the shift in policy contained an element of chance .

When in September 1922 the ARA discovered that the Soviet government intended to export grain in considerable quantities , most foreign relief <head>organizations</head> joined in the hue and cry . The government gave a series of reasons for its  decision ,  some of them more plausible than others ;  but the main aim seemed to be to acquire cash or foreign credit for the rehabilitation of its industries .  More grain than expected had to be exported due to the precipitous fall in the grain price in the middle of the winter of 19223 .

Non - Russian papers were left to local military supervision until the end of Civil War ,  and largely to their own devices throughout 1922 ,  unless they exhibited blatant defiance of high political directives ,  as in the case of Georgia .

The ending of the former child allowances and their replacement with tax - free child benefits in 1975 meant an increase in the problem of dependency ,  with only about half the 750,000 one - parent families in 1976 ,  for instance ,  able to rely on their income as means of support .

He was clearly attracted to rural religious communities ,  such as that at Kelham where he himself participated or that seventeenth - century community of Little Gidding which he was later to celebrate .  Yet he saw the danger in making these communities an ideal ,  as he turned an anthropological eye on Christianity and perceived that such examples seem to proffer no solution to industrial urban and suburban existence  the way most people live .  Such a religious patterning of small communities reveals a Christendom fixed at the state of development suitable to a simple agricultural and piscatorial society , and so imperfectly suited to the more complicated <head>organization</head> of modern society . Eliot 's  solution of a widespread Christian community hierarchically organized ,  related both to the state and individual parishes and containing intellectual leaders ,  owes much to Benda 's  notion of clercs  ,  as well as to the anthropologists '  stress on the connection of religion with society .  As in After Strange Gods  ,  he is concerned in his conclusion with a return to sources ,   that is with going back to the savage and working forwards towards his solution to the problem of modern industrial life ;  again such a movement is presented in terms of a familiar encounter .

If disputes within the party over policy and doctrine were one symptom of Conservative confusion ,  another was the legion of leagues which appeared in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ,  when it seemed that hardly a year went by without the founding of some new right - wing association .  The main aim of Franz Coetzee 's  intriguing study For Party or Country  is to explain this phenomenon through an examination of the outlook and activities of three of the larger groups :  the Navy League  ( NL )  ,  the Tariff Reform League  ( TRL )  ,  and the Anti - Socialist Union  ( ASU )  .  In terms of the history of these <head>organizations</head> as institutions Coetzee 's work is unlikely to be surpassed . He examines their foundation ,  their funding ,  their social constituency ,  and their organizational structure in detail ,  and in the process disposes of a number of myths and conventional wisdoms .  For example ,  Cortzee shows that contemporary tales of the tariff reform millions ,  are not borne out by the relatively impoverished state of the Tariff Reform  League ,  and he demonstrates that the variety of industries and economic activities which were represented in the TRL defy any attempt to produce a simple definition of its interest base .

On issues like this Coetzee 's sensitivity and grasp of detail are shown to good effect : but with regard to the broader historical significance of these <head>organizations</head> he is less assured , and he leaves untouched some of the more important questions raised by his work . The leitmotif of Coetzee 's  book ,  as suggested by his title ,  is that the organizations he has studied faced an ongoing dilemma :  whether to function as adjuncts of the Conservative party or to claim that their aims were national and therefore above party .  In fact ,  as Coetzee demonstrates ,  the personnel of the TRL ,  the NL ,  and the ASU were predominantly Conservative ,  and in this respect their claim to be non - party was always weak .

First ,  it caused the groups some significant problems .  The NL especially suffered a major split because of its refusal after 1906 to endorse Conservative candidates .  The rival , splinter <head>organization</head> which emerged as a result , the Imperial Maritime League ( IML ) , claimed that any serious Navalist had to support the Conservatives , irrespective of the fact that individual Liberal candidates were sound on naval questions , on the grounds that collectively the Liberals were against and the Conservatives in favour of a big Navy . In the end the NL did become demonstrably pro - Conservative and saw off the IML challenge ,  but divisions like this played their part in ensuring that the British Navy League was never as large or influential as its German counterpart .  The second reason for taking the non - party claim seriously is that the various Leagues  and not just the three studied by Coetzee  were frequently critical of the Conservative party and expressed strong reservations about the effectiveness of the Conservatives as a political force .

That there should have been a Navy League ,  a Tariff Reform League ,  and an Anti - Socialist Union filled with Conservatives was an indication that there were many Conservative supporters who felt that the Conservative party was not doing its job properly .  There were occasions when the leagues were of great help to the Conservatives ,  but their relationship to the party was often ambivalent and sometimes hostile ,  and it was not always easy to control their activities .  It is one of the many strengths of Coetzee 's work that he recognizes the disruptive potential of the new <head>organizations</head> , but he concludes that ultimately they were of benefit to the Conservatives . It was not just that they helped out at the occasional by - election ,  but that they pointed to new sources of support whose eventual accommodation ,  and to new issues whose eventual resolution ,  would ultimately modify the party itself and help equip it for the challenges of post - war politics .  As a result of his research into the social constituency of the leagues ,  Coetzee presents them as one of the means whereby the Conservative party broadened its support amongst the middle - class and crucial lower - middle - class voters ,  thus assisting its development from a loose conglomeration of agrarian interests to the predominant party of government in urban ,  industrial Britain '

While with the ancient city state there was a unity between town and country ,  since country settlements were really extensions of the city both in the type of economic activity which took place there and in the principles of social organization in the two places ,  this was not so under feudalism .  The difference led to an important conflict between town and country .  At first the freemen of both town and country had an <head>organization</head> and a type of property which still retained something of the communal as well as something of the private , but in the town a radical transformation was taking place . This transformation was due first to the influx of runaway serfs into the towns which meant that labourers free from the personal ties of feudalism ,  but having no access to the means of production ,  became a dependent and exploitable group which was to become the proletariat .  The proletariat are free labourers in the sense that they can sell their labour to whoever will employ them ,  but are not free to do anything but  sell their labour ,  since they have no access to the means of production :  land ,  tools ,  workshops ,  raw materials .

The third part of Engels 's discussion explains why , in spite of the presence of the State in medieval Europe , some islands of communal <head>organization</head> could and did remain . This is explained in terms of the nature of the Germanic invasions which brought about the destruction of the Roman Empire and is dealt with in Chapters 7 and 8 .

The second part of this second half of The Origin  deals with Greece and Rome and in many ways again follows what Marx and Engels had written previously .  What is new however is the suggestion ,  which at the time of writing must have appeared as the height of impertinence ,  that the Greek and Roman states originated in much the same kind of confederation as the Iroquois .  In this way Engels asserts the generality of the principles discussed , but also he explains the importance of what he believed were remains of gentile principles in the <head>organization</head> of Greece and Rome . ( He does admit however that these remains were  in historical times at least  linked to patrilineal groups ;  rather odd inheritors of the principles of the matrilineal gens .  )  Two other general points also emerge from the discussion of Greece and Rome .

( He does admit however that these remains were  in historical times at least  linked to patrilineal groups ;  rather odd inheritors of the principles of the matrilineal gens .  )  Two other general points also emerge from the discussion of Greece and Rome .  The first is that it shows well the distinction Engels makes between general principles in this case the dissolution of communal <head>organization</head> and the rise of class and specific cases . Engels does not pretend that the histories of Greece ,  Rome ,  and the Iroquois are identical .  What he states is that the dame general principles govern their development ,  although conditions were so different that these principles had considerably different effects in the different cases .

The communal and the familial are not necessarily in opposition  they are matters of levels ,  and although at certain times Marx seems to see this ,  at others he does not and Engels never does .  This is because of their legitimate keenness to stress the presence of a communal principle in the history of mankind .  None the less the fact remains that the presence of descent groups tells us nothing directly about domestic <head>organization</head> . There is ,  however ,  yet another way in which modern anthropologists  could agree with Marx ,  Engels ,  and Morgan concerning the group aspect of marriage .  All would stress that our view of marriage as a private alliance concerning almost exclusively two people is totally inappropriate for most non - capitalist societies ,  especially those based on descent groups .

As we saw ,  most modern anthropologists would ,  like Morgan ,  stress the corporate character of descent groups and would agree that these groups cannot be understood as large families Fortes ,  1953 ,  but they would also stress that some kind of individual domestic unit seems to normally exist in societies with descent groups .  In certain other ways Morgan misled Marx and Engels more irredeemably .  Morgan believed that the only true descent groups were matrilineal , and that matrilineal descent groups gens were fundamentally different in <head>organization</head> from systems where descent was reckoned in the male line . In patrilineal descent groups ,  he argued ,  the individual family and  private property were prominent and the communal principle already moribund .  In fact ,  there seems no difference between patrilineal and matrilineal groups in this respect .

In patrilineal descent groups ,  he argued ,  the individual family and  private property were prominent and the communal principle already moribund .  In fact ,  there seems no difference between patrilineal and matrilineal groups in this respect .  What matters , as Morgan , Marx , and Engels rightly stress , is the corporate <head>organization</head> of descent groups , but these descent groups are just as corporate whether descent is reckoned patrilineally or matrilineally . The reason Morgan gave to explain why corporate descent groups were organized matrilineally was that since there were no individual unions within such groups one could never be sure of the identity of one 's  father .  This state of gens promiscuity is ,  however ,  imaginary and so the reasoning is irrelevant .

The various Dayak societies of Borneo are an example .  This greater variety than that envisaged by Morgan or Engels does certainly modify the picture .  On the whole , however , their ideas concerning the political <head>organization</head> of descent - group society , what they call the gentile constitution , are surprisingly modern and helpful and seem supported by more recent findings . The next stage in Morgan 's  and Engels 's  scheme for the evolution of political systems is characterized by confederations of different tribes .  Morgan ,  whom Engels followed ,  was once again basing himself on his studies of the Iroquois .

The Trades Union Congress weighed in with a Green Charter ,  which included the right to hold green strikes over issues like the importation of toxic wastes .

Marie Stopes 's  books ,  Married Love and Wise Parenthood may have sold widely in the early 1920s but the main readers were almost certainly the middle class .  Richard Allan Soloway 's  excellent study of the birth control movement between 1870 and 1930 may well reveal the extent to which these groups were concerned about the need to spread knowledge about birth control amongst the working classes but ,  it would seem ,  in the light of more recent research ,  that such concern was inappropriate .  Soloway 's comment that , The birth control groups found it difficult to persuade the middle and upper - class membership of the feminist <head>organizations</head> that access to the contraceptive methods was a genuine problem , seems both ill - founded and unnecessary . Indeed ,  it seems highly likely that working - class families would have controlled family size through the old ,  rather than new ,  techniques .  The evidence of the 1949 Royal Commission on Population on the use of birth control techniques ,  recognised to be inadequate on the matter ,  suggests that only 40 per cent of women married between 1910 and 1919 used some form of birth control at some time in their marriage compared with 66 per cent of those married between 1935 and 1939 .

To him , however , the overriding developments were the increasing centralization of party <head>organization</head> and the growing predominance of the unions . The party could only go as far as the unions would allow and their influence was apparent at all levels .  It was the union organizations in both urban and rural constituencies which guaranteed continuity and finance :  What emerged was informal ,  often improvised ,  but remarkably tough .

Yet ,  although Britain suffered severe economic depression and rising unemployment ,  her economic plight was much less marked than that of Germany and Italy .  Perhaps for this reason Britain experienced little in the way of a fascist movement in the 1920s ;  only a few small and insignificant fascist groups ,  hostile to the Bolsheviks or the Jews ,  emerged at that time .  It was not until the 1930s that a more effective fascist <head>organization</head> , the British Union of Fascists ( BUF ) , was formed under the leadership of Oswald Mosley , at a time when Britain was attempting to deal with the unemployment of between 20 and 23 per cent . When the BUF developed it created something of a stir as the various political parties adjusted to its presence .  There was ,  indeed ,  quite a furore over its activities ,  and particularly at the violence associated with its Olympia Meeting of June 1934 .

Neither proposition is necessarily correct .  The Labour Party subsequently achieved some measure of socialism under Attlee ,  despite the hostility of capitalism ,  and the Labour Party was well informed about the real strength of the fascist challenge .  Quite rightly , the Labour Party did not wish to exaggerate the importance of a fringe political group which it had investigated in a detailed national survey , based upon a circular to the secretaries of its constituency <head>organizations</head> in 1934 . The Labour Party was well aware of the limited challenge of British fascism and could discriminate between the threat it posed compared with the more serious threat of European fascism .  This survey highlighted the fact that there were few centres of fascist support outside London ,  Manchester ,  Birmingham and Leeds  areas where there was a significant Jewish presence or where Mosley exerted some personal appeal .

After the conference ,  the Socialist League continued to oppose rearmament ,  opposed sanctions against Italy threatened as a result of the Italian invasion of Abyssinia ,  and advocated a policy for the Labour movement of preparing for the mass resistance to war ,  by which was meant a general strike .  In January 1937 it patched together a new united front campaign in association with the ILP ,  the Communists ,  the Left Book Club and Tribune ,  around a programme of defence for the Spanish Republic ,  opposition to rearmament by the National government ,  support for the struggles of the unemployed and the affiliation of the Communist Party and the ILP to the Labour Party. The campaign was in defiance of the Labour Party ban on joint work with the Communists and the Socialist League was condemned by the party , its members being forced to choose between disbanding the <head>organization</head> of expulsion . The Socialist League was thus dissolved in May 1937 .  The failure of the united front campaign persuaded the left of the anti - fascist movement to reconsider its strategy .

The size and range of the relief activities undertaken shows the strength of public support for the Spanish Republican government .  At the national level there was a National Joint Council for Spanish Relief ,  chaired by the Duchess of Atholl ,  a Conservative MP ,  though dominated by Liberal and Labour .  This committee acted as the co - ordinator for the activities of many other <head>organizations</head> , including the Spanish Medical Aid Committee , the Spain Foodship Youth Committee , the League of Nations Committee , the Peace Pledge Union , and various local councils of action and ad hoc bodies . Most towns had Aid Spain Committees ,  which collected tins of milk ,  bars of soap ,  money for medical aid as well as holding meetings to explain the cause of Republican Spain .  While many of these bodies were underpinned by Labour and working - class support it should be recognized that they attracted support from across the social and political spectrum .

The more militant Protestants saw this as a weakness ,  a lack of will on the part of the government .  It was now illegal to be a Protestant in a Protestant country .  The result was periodic clashes between the government and <head>organizations</head> such as Protestant Action which insisted on the right to march where they wished . Porter and Paisley were frequently to be found leading such marches and various Ministers for Home Affairs found themselves being denounced by loyalists at Orange rallies .

The city council planned to call it the Queen Elizabeth Bridge but the more assertive Protestants wanted a memorial to Lord Carson .  So angry was Ian Paisley at the affront to Carson 's  memory that he increased his tirade of abuse against O'Neill ,  produced Carson 's  son to  contest the Westminster elections in March  ( promising four Protestant Unionists in all )  and only withdrew when he realised how devoid of constituency organisation he then was .  The rudiments of a constituency <head>organization</head> were then provided . As is so often the case in Paisley 's  career ,  the crucial step was taken by someone other than Paisley and then offered to Paisley as an opportunity the possibilities of which he could appreciate .

It is important to note that it was only the statements of this man and his wife which contained any evidence of Paisley 's  knowledge of the crimes ,  and the juries determined that they were not trustworthy witnesses .  The view of Paisley 's  critics was that he was implicated but was clever enough to avoid any direct contact .  Others maintained that , even if he knew nothing of these crimes , he was morally responsible in that he had contributed substantially to the general climate which allowed members of his <head>organization</head> to believe that such acts were justified in order to destabilize the government of Terence O'Neill . This second charge is impossible to evaluate .  While it is certainly the case that Paisley was prepared to use militant rhetoric in denouncing O'Neillism ,  it is also the case that he was a vocal critic of private initiative in vigilantism and of attacks on Catholics .

In their view ,  the old party had been doing well .  It now had members in Stormont and increasing popular support and ,  more importantly ,  it had a clear Protestant  identity .  In many areas , it took the full weight of Paisley 's authority , exercised either directly or through loyal supporters such as Gordon Cooke , then chairman of the North Antrim branch , to persuade the Protestant Unionists to dissolve in favour of the new <head>organization</head> . In the event ,  the failure of large numbers of Official Unionists to join meant that the new party was more congenial to the old Protestant Unionists than they had initially feared .  Protestant Unionists made up about two - thirds of the new Ulster Democratic Unionist Party  ( hereafter DUP )  .

When the DUP was being planned in late 1971 ,  Desmond Boal kept pushing Unionists such as Austin Ardill to join the new party and received assurances from him and a number of others that they would join .  It was only their reluctance to abandon their own party which prevented the creation of a mass anti - appeasement party .  At a number of times since , there has been a genuine willingness among some of the DUP members of the United Ulster Unionist Coalition to merge their party into a new wider <head>organization</head> . Although Ian Paisley had unfailing faith in his own leadership qualities  a faith that was shared by his supporters  he was willing to work in coalition with the other unionist leaders ,  and the continued divisions within the unionist camp cannot be laid entirely at his door .

Treating the whole province as a single constituency gave Paisley a chance to cash in on his considerable personal support .

In order to do this ,  Jerry Falwell and the other Baptist pastors in the movement have to operate with almost watertight compartments for ,  on the one hand ,  their religion  ( in this box Catholics and Jews are doomed sinners )  ,  and on the other ,  their politics  ( we are all part of a shared Judeo - Christian tradition )  .  That sort of compartmentalization has been roundly denounced by Bob Jones University and those sections of American fundamentalism with which Paisley is most at home but we will never know if his religio - political system would permit such pragmatism because the constitutional issue so overrides everything else in Northern Ireland that there is no expectation or need for him to work with conservative Catholics .  This does not mean that Paisley would not be glad of the support ( such as he had in his campaign to Save Ulster From Sodomy ) of individual Catholics , but he would not work with Catholic <head>organizations</head> or officials of the Catholic Church because that might dilute his separatist witness .

Nevertheless they were considerably more evangelical at the turn of the century than they are now .  The problem for the Free Presbyterians is that the fraternal orders have always seen themselves as linking the broad Protestant religious tradition with the main unionist party ,  hence the common arrangement of Orange Lodges holding their annual church parades at each of the Church of Ireland ,  Presbyterian ,  and Methodist churches in turn .  As the main churches have become more liberal , Free Presbyterianism emerged to challenge the lack of real Protestantism and hence offered an implicit challenge to the fraternal <head>organizations</head> to purify themselves by breaking their ties with the main , and now apostate , denominations . Ian Paisley was once a member of the Shankill Road Lodge of the Orange Order and a lodge chaplain ,  but he resigned from the Order when the County Grand Lodge refused to expel Sir Robin Kinahan for attending a funeral service in a Roman Catholic chapel .  Another Free Presbyterian minister ,  Austin Allen ,  resigned from the Order because it would not accept Free Presbyterian ministers as district chaplains .

A third Free Presbyterian minister said :  Perhaps the main reason for leaving the Orange Order was that in 1969 I was saved by the grace of God and therefore felt that I could not sit and be associated with members of the Orange and Black while they consumed alcohol in their meetings on the 12th and 13th mornings each July .   Given the Free Presbyterian Church 's  high political profile one would expect that many of its ministers would be active in the Orange Lodge ,  Black Preceptory ,  and Apprentice Boys .

This is even more the case since the Anglo - Irish accord of November 1985 which clearly represents the British government 's  view that solutions to the Northern Ireland problem require the active involvement of the Dublin government .

It is usually the case that those things which best suit the Michels model are social movement <head>organizations</head> which have goals which can be compromised because they are things like an increase in workers ' standards of living or an improvement in working conditions which are divisible .

But when it comes down to concrete moral judgements and commitments ,  such abstractions will be found interpreted in opposing ways .  Religion The Roman catholic church retained a unified hierarchical <head>organization</head> for the whole of the island with its bishops meeting periodically at Maynooth . In 1927 ,  1929 ,  1956 ,  and 1960 ,  there were plenary synods and councils .  Since then ,  the hierarchy has met more or less three times per year ,  but usually in secret sessions .

Since then ,  the hierarchy has met more or less three times per year ,  but usually in secret sessions .  In the North ,  the bishops pursued the Irish catholic community 's  interests in what could only be called a spirit of pillarization .  This is the arrangement in Holland whereby various institutions such as media , schools , cultural <head>organizations</head> , welfare services , and hospitals are duplicated , and run by the separate catholic and protestant communities . In Holland there is even a third or state sector .  In Ulster a full panoply of institutions emerged from the dual pressure of the church 's  concern for its people ,  and the Northern state 's  discrimination against catholics .

The clerical and lay leadership also experienced a third pressure ,  that of protecting the faithful from the proselytizing activities of a number of evangelical protestants mainly among the young .  The church obtained a separate school system ,  funded mainly by the Northern  Ireland government ,  similar to the system of catholic schools in Britain .  It also set up its own scouting <head>organizations</head> , clubs both sporting and social , with Irish music , Irish dancing , and Irish or Gaelic games . These games were and still are much loathed by the majority within the Northern protestant community .  Priests continued to act as sponsors of the local catholic  nationalist political structure ,  chairing meetings of the party and permitting the political use of the parish hall .

From its domination by the old ascendancy ,  the Orange order in particular came to embrace protestants from all classes and churches .  In fact ,  in rural areas today ,  the Orange hall has frequently been the only place where protestants of all shades have met to renew their belief and commitment to Ulster protestant loyalism  ( Harris 1972 :  1625 )  .  It is important to note that these <head>organizations</head> are internally stratified . Those nearer the top ,  particularly in the Black Preceptory ,  the inner sanctum of the society structure ,  are there because of their moral and religious standing in the local community :  wealthy farmers ,  businessmen ,  good churchmen ,  or at least of known moral probity .  They tend to represent the religious as opposed to the rough end of the protestant spiritual spectrum .

Two years previously ,  a campaign to write into the Irish constitution the existing legislation criminalizing abortion had got under way under the name of the Pro - Life Amendment Campaign .  It is difficult to describe this body accurately .

Having acquired a sufficient number of signatures ,  the Campaign submitted their referendum proposal ,  which the government of the day ,  the Fine Gael  Labour coalition under Garret FitzGerald which had come into power that year ,  decided  to submit to the populace .  The Roman catholic bishops supported the wording of the referendum and ,  as the referendum approached ,  said it was legitimate to oppose the amendment even if one was against abortion ,  which was in any case still immoral and was the direct taking of an innocent life  ( Irish Bishops '  Conference statement ,  quoted O'Carroll 1983 )  .

With hindsight it seems that the prevailing structures of police practice will remain as powerful as ever ,  for at a conference on policing at Bristol University  ( 1988 )  ,  the newly retired Sir Kenneth admitted that police culture had defeated many of his attempts to bring a new ethic to the managerial style during his reign as commissioner of the metropolis .  ANTHROPOLOGY FOR THE POLICE It seems relevant that anthropology be used at this time to contribute to the debate on policing , for since the 1964 Police Act and the preceding Royal Commission which was generated through concern over police practice , the <head>organization</head> has held an increasingly central place in the public imagination . Policing issues are never long out of the headlines  ( Chibnall 1977 )  ,  and this media obsession has been transmitted into a  wealth of analyses of policing  which have mostly been carried out by outside observers .  Indeed insider accounts have largely consisted of bland reminiscences in the style of my greatest arrests and cases and it has been left to investigative journalism to redress some unacceptable police activity ,  by calling attention to the limits and abuses of police authority ,  power ,  and accountability .

In 1979 ,  James Anderton ,  the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester ,  described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from seditionist interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy  ( Thompson 1979 :  380 )  .  In the light of such a polemic stand ,  it begs the question whether the revelation of how crime figures are manipulated by the police to sustain institutional beliefs  ( see Chapter 5 )  could be said to undermine democracy or be classified as sedition .  For Anderton vehemently rejects the idea of any internal evaluation which might explore the moralities or philosophies of policing : there is simply no room in the management and <head>organization</head> of police operations for vague , academic dissertations ( Police Review ; 90 , 19 November 1982 : 4684 ) . In his 1977 annual report ,  Sir David McNee ,  then commissioner of the Metropolitan Police ,  urged that the libertarian should beware .  In due course ,  his successor ,  Sir Kenneth Newman ,  echoed this anti - intellectual stance ,  when he warned insiders that policemen must remember that they are practitioners ,  not crusaders ;  theirs is to do ,  not to righteously philosophise  ( Police Journal  56 ,  No. 1  ( 1983 )  )  .

Such people are radically opposed to the idea of sociologists conducting research on the police and long for a return to a golden age when the proverbial veil of secrecy surrounded police work .  When the research is experiential ,  carried out by an insider ,  the publications can prove emotive and will almost certainly be career - problematic for the author .  Usually policemen know the limits allowed by the <head>organization</head> and play safe . Harry Templeton  ( 1980 )  ,  a police officer in North Wales ,  suggested :  when you read in Police Review that an officer has been awarded an M.A. after post - graduate study ,  it will probably be in a safe subject such as business management .

all totalitarian institutions  ( in Goffman 's  phrase )  embody their principles in an inexplicit way ,  beyond the grasp of consciousness and exhort the essential by an implicit pedagogy ,  capable of instilling a whole cosmology ,  an ethic ,  a political philosophy through injunctions as insignificant as stand up straight .  It is little wonder then that social research is equated with clap trap in police magazines ,  for they aim to support the beliefs of those who have taken on this unconscious cosmology ,  and for whom as Bourdieu  ( ibid .  )  indicates ,  such challenges would defy the most natural manifestations of submission to the established order and abolish lateral possibilities .  In consequence of this acquired system of generative schemes , an imbued belief is implanted in the institutional mind which verges on the natural , while Huxley 's mutilated man pursuing his insider 's reflexivity seeks out the lateral possibility , and makes gestures against the principles of the <head>organization</head> .

None of them made a special selection of materials suitable for the peasantry ,  so the few books that were dispatched were often too dry or too expensive .

The arrogance of Bolshevik - inspired youth towards the patriarchal rural community also transpires from other criticisms directed against younger visitors .  But peasants also complained when what they called doctors came out to inspect their cattle and sanitary arrangements ,  or when two peasants who had murdered their wives had to be handed over to a visiting social court  (  obshchestvennyi sud  )  set up by a shefstvo team .

These efforts proved to be in vain for the most part .  By the middle of 1924 the Agitprop section of the Smolgubkom  was openly declaring that both shefstvo and smychka were a farce in actuality because they had deteriorated into mass weekend outings to the countryside in search of illicit stills .

In our survey of the financial arrangements of NEP as they applied to the Smolensk guberniia ,  it was noted how they were unstable and poorly defined from the outset ,  leading to economic and social tensions at the lower levels .  Right from its inception NEP carried within itself the germs of its own fatal illness , whether one looks at its fiscal <head>organization</head> or the economic persona ( like these Nepmen ) which it soon evoked , or in many cases re - awakened . It is true that high - level Bolshevik theorists in Moscow and Petrograd tended to select ,  filter ,  and interpret evidence from the localities in the light of their prevailing general beliefs ,  so that their conclusions had little foundation in hard evidence .

In reality ,  a Komsomol political instructor  ( with a criminal record )  entered the colony in 1925 ,  well after Makarenko had established discipline .

Yet we cannot take foreign accounts at their face value either .  Political propaganda on the part of the American Relief Administration ,  by far the longest foreign source of aid ,  warped its judgement at the time ,  and the subsequent polarization of Russian - American relations has not improved the objectivity of later scholarly accounts of the Famine as seen through American eyes .

Due to wartime conditions the peasantry got the same amount of agricultural machinery over the years 191521 that they had been able to buy in a single year prior to the World War .  They had suffered in the Civil War from requisitioning by Red ,  White ,  and Green armies ,  and to some extent from the Bolshevik - inspired kombedy   ( committees of poor peasants )  .  As the Famine grew , poor co - operation between the Soviet authorities and foreign relief groups , and amongst the foreign <head>organizations</head> themselves , exacerbated the situation . The worst aspects  of co - ordination ,  however ,  were central - local relations within the Soviet hierarchy .

Certainly suspect committee members had attempted to go abroad ,  but the real reason was probably that the committee had served its purpose by acting as a bait to attract foreign relief organizations  ( the ARA drew up an agreement on 20 August )  .

Since all foreign relief <head>organizations</head> dealt with Pomgol and with Eiduk as chief plenipotentiary , subsequent non - Russian scholars have tended to over - concentrate on the workings of Pomgol and its guberniia equivalents .

Gosplan and other central economic organs from 1921 on had accumulated on paper a number of plans for reconstruction which they were now eager to realize .  As in the recent past ,  and as was to be the case with much greater frequency after the start of the Five - Year Plans ,  planners in Moscow drew up neat and rather abstract formulations that did not match up closely with local realities and timings .  Foreign relief <head>organizations</head> and subsequent students of their work have tended to exaggerate this dichotomy with regard to the Famine , but internal Soviet sources lend credence to the view that the sudden withdrawal of many kinds of domestic relief was premature . In 1922 it was not so easy to predict crop yields as it is today .  In that sense the shift in policy contained an element of chance .

The government gave a series of reasons for its  decision ,  some of them more plausible than others ;  but the main aim seemed to be to acquire cash or foreign credit for the rehabilitation of its industries .  More grain than expected had to be exported due to the precipitous fall in the grain price in the middle of the winter of 19223 .

Non - Russian papers were left to local military supervision until the end of Civil War ,  and largely to their own devices throughout 1922 ,  unless they exhibited blatant defiance of high political directives ,  as in the case of Georgia .  This did not necessarily mean that all local party chiefs in the minorities were also lethargic during 1922 .  We know from the Smolensk archive that the guberniia committee in the winter of 19223 convened meetings of many local <head>organizations</head> , compelling their members to subscribe to various Belorussian and Great - Russian newspapers . Particular stress was laid on subscriptions to Rabochii put '  ,  the guberniia party and Soviet organ .  The local peasant press was in a lamentable condition still .

But the task was increasingly beyond them ,  as social surveys showed the inability of the welfare services to cope with the specific needs of  the aged ,  the disabled ,  and one - parent families .  Divorces rose steadily ,  though the real acceleration in the divorce rate was to come after the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act of 1 984 which allowed petitioning for divorce after only one year of marriage .  Especially disadvantaged were children , whose needs were dramatically highlighted by the Child Poverty Action Group and similar <head>organizations</head> . The ending of the former child allowances and their replacement with tax - free child benefits in 1975 meant an increase in the problem of dependency ,  with only about half the 750,000 one - parent families in 1976 ,  for instance ,  able to rely on their income as means of support .  An unduly high proportion of such families were black .

That scepticism and memory were to be important when he became an archbishop and was expected to be a leader in the organization .

He was clearly attracted to rural religious communities ,  such as that at Kelham where he himself participated or that seventeenth - century community of Little Gidding which he was later to celebrate .  Yet he saw the danger in making these communities an ideal ,  as he turned an anthropological eye on Christianity and perceived that such examples seem to proffer no solution to industrial urban and suburban existence  the way most people live .  Such a religious patterning of small communities reveals a Christendom fixed at the state of development suitable to a simple agricultural and piscatorial society , and so imperfectly suited to the more complicated <head>organization</head> of modern society . Eliot 's  solution of a widespread Christian community hierarchically organized ,  related both to the state and individual parishes and containing intellectual leaders ,  owes much to Benda 's  notion of clercs  ,  as well as to the anthropologists '  stress on the connection of religion with society .  As in After Strange Gods  ,  he is concerned in his conclusion with a return to sources ,   that is with going back to the savage and working forwards towards his solution to the problem of modern industrial life ;  again such a movement is presented in terms of a familiar encounter .

The attempt to locate libertarian Conservatism in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century seems implausible .

Here he finds <head>organizations</head> like the Liberty and property Defence League ( LPDL ) and The British Constitutional Association ( BCA ) , and individuals like Lord Wemyss , Herbert Spencer , A. V. Dicey , and Ernest Benn , all committed to individualism and all found supporting the political right . Eccleshall also finds backing here from one of the recent histories of  the late Victorian and Edwardian Conservative Party. The work of Matthew Fforde appears to offer an historical lifeline to those ,  like Eccleshall ,  who would present Thatcherism in terms of an established tradition of libertarian Conservative thought .

If disputes within the party over policy and doctrine were one symptom of Conservative confusion ,  another was the legion of leagues which appeared in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ,  when it seemed that hardly a year went by without the founding of some new right - wing association .  The main aim of Franz Coetzee 's  intriguing study For Party or Country  is to explain this phenomenon through an examination of the outlook and activities of three of the larger groups :  the Navy League  ( NL )  ,  the Tariff Reform League  ( TRL )  ,  and the Anti - Socialist Union  ( ASU )  .  In terms of the history of these <head>organizations</head> as institutions Coetzee 's work is unlikely to be surpassed . He examines their foundation ,  their funding ,  their social constituency ,  and their organizational structure in detail ,  and in the process disposes of a number of myths and conventional wisdoms .  For example ,  Cortzee shows that contemporary tales of the tariff reform millions ,  are not borne out by the relatively impoverished state of the Tariff Reform  League ,  and he demonstrates that the variety of industries and economic activities which were represented in the TRL defy any attempt to produce a simple definition of its interest base .

On issues like this Coetzee 's sensitivity and grasp of detail are shown to good effect : but with regard to the broader historical significance of these <head>organizations</head> he is less assured , and he leaves untouched some of the more important questions raised by his work . The leitmotif of Coetzee 's  book ,  as suggested by his title ,  is that the organizations he has studied faced an ongoing dilemma :  whether to function as adjuncts of the Conservative party or to claim that their aims were national and therefore above party .  In fact ,  as Coetzee demonstrates ,  the personnel of the TRL ,  the NL ,  and the ASU were predominantly Conservative ,  and in this respect their claim to be non - party was always weak .

First ,  it caused the groups some significant problems .  The NL especially suffered a major split because of its refusal after 1906 to endorse Conservative candidates .  The rival , splinter <head>organization</head> which emerged as a result , the Imperial Maritime League ( IML ) , claimed that any serious Navalist had to support the Conservatives , irrespective of the fact that individual Liberal candidates were sound on naval questions , on the grounds that collectively the Liberals were against and the Conservatives in favour of a big Navy . In the end the NL did become demonstrably pro - Conservative and saw off the IML challenge ,  but divisions like this played their part in ensuring that the British Navy League was never as large or influential as its German counterpart .  The second reason for taking the non - party claim seriously is that the various Leagues  and not just the three studied by Coetzee  were frequently critical of the Conservative party and expressed strong reservations about the effectiveness of the Conservatives as a political force .

That there should have been a Navy League ,  a Tariff Reform League ,  and an Anti - Socialist Union filled with Conservatives was an indication that there were many Conservative supporters who felt that the Conservative party was not doing its job properly .  There were occasions when the leagues were of great help to the Conservatives ,  but their relationship to the party was often ambivalent and sometimes hostile ,  and it was not always easy to control their activities .  It is one of the many strengths of Coetzee 's work that he recognizes the disruptive potential of the new <head>organizations</head> , but he concludes that ultimately they were of benefit to the Conservatives . It was not just that they helped out at the occasional by - election ,  but that they pointed to new sources of support whose eventual accommodation ,  and to new issues whose eventual resolution ,  would ultimately modify the party itself and help equip it for the challenges of post - war politics .  As a result of his research into the social constituency of the leagues ,  Coetzee presents them as one of the means whereby the Conservative party broadened its support amongst the middle - class and crucial lower - middle - class voters ,  thus assisting its development from a loose conglomeration of agrarian interests to the predominant party of government in urban ,  industrial Britain '

Only gradually did it dawn on those responsible that vigorous and determined nationalist <head>organizations</head> had grown up in the shadow of the Japanese , that these movements had flourished exceedingly in the vacuum left by the collapse of Japanese power , and that if the colonial regimes were to be reconstituted it could only be by force . Mountbatten 's  personal view was that the new nationalist movements should be appeased rather than suppressed and that the old colonial powers should settle for the best deal that they could get ,  pledging independence in the near future and thus ,  he hoped ,  preserving the greater part of their economic advantages .  In Burma ,  where he had only the British Colonial Office and colonial administrators to deal with ,  he was more or less able to have his way .

First of all society ,  as distinct from the State ,  had to be isolated and analysed ,  and secondly an attempt had to be made at understanding the evolution of society ,  since only then would it be possible to understand under what circumstances the State evolved and what its historical significance was .  These were the tasks first attempted in The German Ideology  .  The first task consisted of formulating a view of society which was based on principles different from the traditional ones , according to which societies could be typified in terms of their administrative <head>organization</head> by using such terms as democracy or monarchy . If we talked of society in these terms ,  Marx argued ,  we could never appreciate that the phenomena to which the terms referred were themselves only the product of a more fundamental social process .

While with the ancient city state there was a unity between town and country ,  since country settlements were really extensions of the city both in the type of economic activity which took place there and in the principles of social organization in the two places ,  this was not so under feudalism .  The difference led to an important conflict between town and country .  At first the freemen of both town and country had an <head>organization</head> and a type of property which still retained something of the communal as well as something of the private , but in the town a radical transformation was taking place . This transformation was due first to the influx of runaway serfs into the towns which meant that labourers free from the personal ties of feudalism ,  but having no access to the means of production ,  became a dependent and exploitable group which was to become the proletariat .  The proletariat are free labourers in the sense that they can sell their labour to whoever will employ them ,  but are not free to do anything but  sell their labour ,  since they have no access to the means of production :  land ,  tools ,  workshops ,  raw materials .

This Engels does by showing that the Greek and Roman states ,  the sacred sources of the European ideal ,  were based on principles which can also be seen in embryo among  much less prestigious peoples ,  the American Indians .  This is dealt with in Chapters 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  and 6 .  The third part of Engels 's discussion explains why , in spite of the presence of the State in medieval Europe , some islands of communal <head>organization</head> could and did remain . This is explained in terms of the nature of the Germanic invasions which brought about the destruction of the Roman Empire and is dealt with in Chapters 7 and 8 .  The outline of the evolutionary theory of the State in The Origin  is one we are already familiar with from the earlier writings of Marx and Engels ,  but it is expanded here with new information from Morgan .

The second part of this second half of The Origin  deals with Greece and Rome and in many ways again follows what Marx and Engels had written previously .  What is new however is the suggestion ,  which at the time of writing must have appeared as the height of impertinence ,  that the Greek and Roman states originated in much the same kind of confederation as the Iroquois .  In this way Engels asserts the generality of the principles discussed , but also he explains the importance of what he believed were remains of gentile principles in the <head>organization</head> of Greece and Rome . ( He does admit however that these remains were  in historical times at least  linked to patrilineal groups ;  rather odd inheritors of the principles of the matrilineal gens .  )  Two other general points also emerge from the discussion of Greece and Rome .

The communal and the familial are not necessarily in opposition  they are matters of levels ,  and although at certain times Marx seems to see this ,  at others he does not and Engels never does .  This is because of their legitimate keenness to stress the presence of a communal principle in the history of mankind .  None the less the fact remains that the presence of descent groups tells us nothing directly about domestic <head>organization</head> . There is ,  however ,  yet another way in which modern anthropologists  could agree with Marx ,  Engels ,  and Morgan concerning the group aspect of marriage .  All would stress that our view of marriage as a private alliance concerning almost exclusively two people is totally inappropriate for most non - capitalist societies ,  especially those based on descent groups .

As we saw ,  most modern anthropologists would ,  like Morgan ,  stress the corporate character of descent groups and would agree that these groups cannot be understood as large families Fortes ,  1953 ,  but they would also stress that some kind of individual domestic unit seems to normally exist in societies with descent groups .  In certain other ways Morgan misled Marx and Engels more irredeemably .  Morgan believed that the only true descent groups were matrilineal , and that matrilineal descent groups gens were fundamentally different in <head>organization</head> from systems where descent was reckoned in the male line . In patrilineal descent groups ,  he argued ,  the individual family and  private property were prominent and the communal principle already moribund .  In fact ,  there seems no difference between patrilineal and matrilineal groups in this respect .

What matters , as Morgan , Marx , and Engels rightly stress , is the corporate <head>organization</head> of descent groups , but these descent groups are just as corporate whether descent is reckoned patrilineally or matrilineally . The reason Morgan gave to explain why corporate descent groups were organized matrilineally was that since there were no individual unions within such groups one could never be sure of the identity of one 's  father .  This state of gens promiscuity is ,  however ,  imaginary and so the reasoning is irrelevant .

The Greens had planned to hold their 1989 rally in the Sorbonne ,  but at the last minute they were told they would have to go elsewhere and the only venue available at short notice was the Cit .

Euro - elections were pending and , it was rumoured , he was doing his best to make life miserable for an <head>organization</head> which challenged his claim to the green constituency . Give the meek a good deal  join the Greens ,  announced a poster on a publicity stand in the foyer of the conference hall .

To do that in the way the Greens proposed would require a virtually totalitarian state ,  Bryan Gould  ( at the time Shadow Trade Secretary )  told the shadow cabinet in July 1989 .  He admitted ,  though ,  that Labour was seen as too producer - oriented :  We should be able to give a value to unpolluted air ,  clean water ,  a safe environment ,  as the end - products of economic activity .  A great many green ideas were produced by Labour that summer ; a green bill to show up the deficiencies in Tory legislation ; making the quality of life the central theme in the 1990 local elections ; the mobilization of public opinion through the development of a network of environmental , countryside and energy <head>organizations</head> . The Trades Union Congress weighed in with a Green Charter ,  which included the right to hold green strikes over issues like the importation of toxic wastes .  But by the end of the year the green bill had been quietly dropped and the environmental network had vanished into a general belief in the need for good ,  informal relations with Friends of the Earth and other environmental organizations .

Climate change is already more important than acid rain ,  genetic engineering a more topical issue than saving whales .

This needs to be stated clearly because there is a current media clich that Greenpeace is turning its back on such tactics and is becoming a more bureaucratic ,  softer version of its earlier radical self .  This is demonstrably untrue ;  the number of direct actions continues in an upwards spiral .  What is true is that , in recent years , such actions have been backed up by sophisticated political lobbying and scientific enquiry that have added strength to the <head>organization</head> 's dramatic calls for change . Greenpeace 's  continued insistence on non - violent tactics ,  even when faced with violence ,  reflects both its cultural origins and its links with the other great movements for social change in the twentieth century .

In addition to the giant panda  ( its logo )  it has reprieved  ( WWF 's  word )  the Indian tiger and the polar bear ,  the latter by persuading the five Arctic nations to restrict hunting .  The African elephant was a notable beneficiary of WWF 's  activities in 1989 ,  with two British lawyers working on its behalf during the negotiations on the Cites agreement on ivory .

Marie Stopes 's  books ,  Married Love and Wise Parenthood may have sold widely in the early 1920s but the main readers were almost certainly the middle class .  Richard Allan Soloway 's  excellent study of the birth control movement between 1870 and 1930 may well reveal the extent to which these groups were concerned about the need to spread knowledge about birth control amongst the working classes but ,  it would seem ,  in the light of more recent research ,  that such concern was inappropriate .  Soloway 's comment that , The birth control groups found it difficult to persuade the middle and upper - class membership of the feminist <head>organizations</head> that access to the contraceptive methods was a genuine problem , seems both ill - founded and unnecessary . Indeed ,  it seems highly likely that working - class families would have controlled family size through the old ,  rather than new ,  techniques .  The evidence of the 1949 Royal Commission on Population on the use of birth control techniques ,  recognised to be inadequate on the matter ,  suggests that only 40 per cent of women married between 1910 and 1919 used some form of birth control at some time in their marriage compared with 66 per cent of those married between 1935 and 1939 .

Yet ,  although Britain suffered severe economic depression and rising unemployment ,  her economic plight was much less marked than that of Germany and Italy .  Perhaps for this reason Britain experienced little in the way of a fascist movement in the 1920s ;  only a few small and insignificant fascist groups ,  hostile to the Bolsheviks or the Jews ,  emerged at that time .  It was not until the 1930s that a more effective fascist <head>organization</head> , the British Union of Fascists ( BUF ) , was formed under the leadership of Oswald Mosley , at a time when Britain was attempting to deal with the unemployment of between 20 and 23 per cent .

There was ,  indeed ,  quite a furore over its activities ,  and particularly at the violence associated with its Olympia Meeting of June 1934 .

Neither proposition is necessarily correct .  The Labour Party subsequently achieved some measure of socialism under Attlee ,  despite the hostility of capitalism ,  and the Labour Party was well informed about the real strength of the fascist challenge .  Quite rightly , the Labour Party did not wish to exaggerate the importance of a fringe political group which it had investigated in a detailed national survey , based upon a circular to the secretaries of its constituency <head>organizations</head> in 1934 . The Labour Party was well aware of the limited challenge of British fascism and could discriminate between the threat it posed compared with the more serious threat of European fascism .  This survey highlighted the fact that there were few centres of fascist support outside London ,  Manchester ,  Birmingham and Leeds  areas where there was a significant Jewish presence or where Mosley exerted some personal appeal .

After the conference ,  the Socialist League continued to oppose rearmament ,  opposed sanctions against Italy threatened as a result of the Italian invasion of Abyssinia ,  and advocated a policy for the Labour movement of preparing for the mass resistance to war ,  by which was meant a general strike .  In January 1937 it patched together a new united front campaign in association with the ILP ,  the Communists ,  the Left Book Club and Tribune ,  around a programme of defence for the Spanish Republic ,  opposition to rearmament by the National government ,  support for the struggles of the unemployed and the affiliation of the Communist Party and the ILP to the Labour Party.

The Socialist League was thus dissolved in May 1937 .  The failure of the united front campaign persuaded the left of the anti - fascist movement to reconsider its strategy .

So angry was Ian Paisley at the affront to Carson 's  memory that he increased his tirade of abuse against O'Neill ,  produced Carson 's  son to  contest the Westminster elections in March  ( promising four Protestant Unionists in all )  and only withdrew when he realised how devoid of constituency organisation he then was .

It is important to note that it was only the statements of this man and his wife which contained any evidence of Paisley 's  knowledge of the crimes ,  and the juries determined that they were not trustworthy witnesses .

Others maintained that , even if he knew nothing of these crimes , he was morally responsible in that he had contributed substantially to the general climate which allowed members of his <head>organization</head> to believe that such acts were justified in order to destabilize the government of Terence O'Neill .

When the DUP was being planned in late 1971 ,  Desmond Boal kept pushing Unionists such as Austin Ardill to join the new party and received assurances from him and a number of others that they would join .  It was only their reluctance to abandon their own party which prevented the creation of a mass anti - appeasement party .  At a number of times since , there has been a genuine willingness among some of the DUP members of the United Ulster Unionist Coalition to merge their party into a new wider <head>organization</head> . Although Ian Paisley had unfailing faith in his own leadership qualities  a faith that was shared by his supporters  he was willing to work in coalition with the other unionist leaders ,  and the continued divisions within the unionist camp cannot be laid entirely at his door .  The second footnote is related to this point and it concerns the career of William Beattie .

In order to ensure that the Catholic population won at least one of the three seats allocated to Northern Ireland ,  the whole of the province was treated as one constituency with three members .  The election could hardly have been better designed to promote the DUP .  Although Robinson and others were achieving success in building a province - wide <head>organization</head> , the DUP 's greatest asset was its leader . Treating the whole province as a single constituency gave Paisley a chance to cash in on his considerable personal support .  Paisley was the sole DUP candidate and John Hume was the candidate for the SDLP ,  but the Official Unionists made the tactical mistake of fielding two candidates .

In order to do this ,  Jerry Falwell and the other Baptist pastors in the movement have to operate with almost watertight compartments for ,  on the one hand ,  their religion  ( in this box Catholics and Jews are doomed sinners )  ,  and on the other ,  their politics  ( we are all part of a shared Judeo - Christian tradition )  .  That sort of compartmentalization has been roundly denounced by Bob Jones University and those sections of American fundamentalism with which Paisley is most at home but we will never know if his religio - political system would permit such pragmatism because the constitutional issue so overrides everything else in Northern Ireland that there is no expectation or need for him to work with conservative Catholics .  This does not mean that Paisley would not be glad of the support ( such as he had in his campaign to Save Ulster From Sodomy ) of individual Catholics , but he would not work with Catholic <head>organizations</head> or officials of the Catholic Church because that might dilute his separatist witness . The Evangelicals and the Orange Order The only problems of alliances and compartmentalization faced by Free Presbyterian Democratic Unionists are those which concern the fraternal orders .

Nevertheless they were considerably more evangelical at the turn of the century than they are now .  The problem for the Free Presbyterians is that the fraternal orders have always seen themselves as linking the broad Protestant religious tradition with the main unionist party ,  hence the common arrangement of Orange Lodges holding their annual church parades at each of the Church of Ireland ,  Presbyterian ,  and Methodist churches in turn .  As the main churches have become more liberal , Free Presbyterianism emerged to challenge the lack of real Protestantism and hence offered an implicit challenge to the fraternal <head>organizations</head> to purify themselves by breaking their ties with the main , and now apostate , denominations . Ian Paisley was once a member of the Shankill Road Lodge of the Orange Order and a lodge chaplain ,  but he resigned from the Order when the County Grand Lodge refused to expel Sir Robin Kinahan for attending a funeral service in a Roman Catholic chapel .  Another Free Presbyterian minister ,  Austin Allen ,  resigned from the Order because it would not accept Free Presbyterian ministers as district chaplains .

A third Free Presbyterian minister said :  Perhaps the main reason for leaving the Orange Order was that in 1969 I was saved by the grace of God and therefore felt that I could not sit and be associated with members of the Orange and Black while they consumed alcohol in their meetings on the 12th and 13th mornings each July .   Given the Free Presbyterian Church 's  high political profile one would expect that many of its ministers would be active in the Orange Lodge ,  Black Preceptory ,  and Apprentice Boys .  Of forty - four ministers whose affiliations are known , twenty - one have never been members of any fraternal <head>organization</head> . Ten have been members of the Orange Order but nine have resigned .  Three have been members of the Independent Orange Order and one has resigned .

Three have been members of the Independent Orange Order and one has resigned .  Ten ministers are known to be members of the Apprentice Boys of Derry .  It would be easy to exaggerate the extent to which the lack of genuine evangelicalism in the fraternal <head>organizations</head> creates motivational problems for Free Presbyterians who wish to be active in politics . Some districts are clearly sympathetic to the Democratic Unionists and are willing to invite Free Presbyterian Democratic Unionists such as William McCrea to preach at their church parades .  Some have church parades to Free Presbyterian churches .

This is even more the case since the Anglo - Irish accord of November 1985 which clearly represents the British government 's  view that solutions to the Northern Ireland problem require the active involvement of the Dublin government .  For the DUP to embrace this accord and attempt to make it work would be for it to abandon its opposition to anything which presages a united Ireland .  It is usually the case that those things which best suit the Michels model are social movement <head>organizations</head> which have goals which can be compromised because they are things like an increase in workers ' standards of living or an improvement in working conditions which are divisible . Trade unionists could be persuaded to accept a moderation of their organization 's  stated goals in return for the fulfilment of part of those goals .  The position and ideology of Ulster unionists is such that their goals cannot be divided .
