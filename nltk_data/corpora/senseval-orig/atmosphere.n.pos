A famous passage of art criticism can be cited as one example entirely beyond dispute .  The author spent much of his life as a bachelor Fellow of Brasenose College Oxford ;  his cloistered life was devoted to writing ,  notably on classical antiquity and the Italian Renaissance .  Walter Pater was a master of <head>atmosphere</head> ; he had been inspired as a young man by Ruskin , and his idealism about art and his fine prose were in turn much admired by a younger generation of aesthetes , among whom Oscar Wilde was a prominent figure . One of Pater 's  subjects for a perceptive essay was Leonardo da Vinci ;  it gave special prominence to the painting now generally known as the Mona Lisa  .  The following critical passage comes from this piece ,  first published in the Fortnightly Review  in 1869 ,  and then in 1873 in Pater 's  book ,  Studies in the History of the Renaissance  .

They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,  partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro ,  who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,  was an open - minded historian of this sort .  He wrote enthusiastically about the later work of Arshile Gorky : Gorky 's <head>atmosphere</head> , veiling the hard opaque wall of the canvas , evokes a nocturnal void or the vague , unstable image - space of the day - dreaming mind . And he remembered the painter :  I used to meet him most often in the museums and galleries fixed in rapt contemplation of pictures with that grave ,  searching look which was one of the beauties of his face .

Fnon ,  like other excellent critics ,  was a valued friend of artists ,  and so he remained all his life even though he gave up writing criticism after a decade of working on the Revue blanche  from 1893 to 1903 .  He accepted a position in a dealer 's  gallery ,  where Matisse was among the artists who benefited from his judgement .

Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage  the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the audience are vitally connected to what is going on .  As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself ,  and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for .  Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 , scene 1 of Henry V , which draws the audience into the <head>atmosphere</head> before a battle enormously effectively ) . It is also used as a dramatic device by many contemporary playwrights .   The film is a very distinct dramatic medium .

In fact ,  whereas the parallel protestant movement of evangelical revival was for all people ,  and the issue tended to be decisive ,  catholic spirituality diverged on both points .  The principal one was that conversion and growth were particularly directed at the clerical - religious lite ,  where the annual retreat system formed the annual or biennial centre of the individual spiritual life .  The retreat consisted , and still does , of anything from five to thirty days of spiritual exercises , usually in an <head>atmosphere</head> of silence and contemplation apart from listening to the preacher when there is one , but with additional features of both vocal and silent prayer . The laity had a pale reflection of this programme in the parish mission ,  designed to convert the laity or at least bring them back to regular church practices .  Morality was for the laity ,  whose life was dominated by the battle against mortal sin ,  and who therefore lived under the threat of hell and were always at risk .

The pressure to remodel old pubs is of course nothing new .  The Victorian and Edwardian eras witnessed many wholesale rebuildings of modest Georgian drinking - houses ;  during the Interwar period even more money was pumped into enlarging and rebuilding old pubs ,  as well as in creating large new ones  ( see Alan Powers '  essay below )  .  However , alterations were more often than not effected with some degree of sympathy for the existing fabric and <head>atmosphere</head> . With the advent of postwar Modernism much of this sympathy evaporated .  The ascetic modernists '  rejection of history in order to create a visionary brave New World was clearly incompatible with the historic pub .

The ascetic modernists '  rejection of history in order to create a visionary brave New World was clearly incompatible with the historic pub .  This attitude was amply revealed in the results of the competition  ( Inside the Pub )  launched jointly by The Architectural Review   and The Brewers '  Society in 1949 .  In October of that year the AR regretted that nearly all competition entries had evaded the key problem and had signally failed to achieve the genuine pub <head>atmosphere</head> . Contemporary design ,  the magazine 's  editor regretted ,  because it has no roots in the vernacular idiom will not appear immediately familiar ,  whilst the mock - Tudor and the mock - Georgian styles which have been so prevalent  no matter how misguided in themselves  have sprung from a genuine attempt to preserve a traditional atmosphere .

A pub ,  like any other old building ,  is far more than just its principle facade ,  or its four walls .  As Neil Richardson noted in 1980 ,  An old town pub is not just an attractive Victorian or Georgian facade ,  it is a building which is still being used for the purpose for which it was built .  The design of interiors are as valid today as they were in earlier times the vaults , snugs , parlours , each with their own character , can still provide a pleasant , varied <head>atmosphere</head> . However ,  to public and professionals alike many old buildings are still regarded as representing little more than four external walls .  This even applies to listed buildings :  there is still a worryingly widespread general belief that listing only covers the facade ,  or perhaps just the exterior ,  whereas it is of course expressly designed to protect the whole  building .

This is especially true of those pubs now targeted by the breweries as centres for family eating .  A traditional interior does not have to be incompatible with accommodating whole families ,  nor with providing meals ;  yet an increasing number of old pub interiors are being sacrificed on the altar of the identikit eating house  whether the brewer 's  concept be a downmarket steakhouse or part of a family restaurant chain masquerading as an independent local concern .  Many of the interiors created by the designers of such facilities are as forbidding as the old - fashioned spit - and - sawdust pub ; any lingering <head>atmosphere</head> is swept away in a barrage of stained wood and fake Victoriana , and any casual visitors made to feel inordinately guilty if they do not , alas , wish to eat . The subjugation of individual character in such cases  which on occasion even involves the removal of all traces of the pub 's  actual name  is particularly depressing .  The aim of this report is not to demand that brewers turn the block back to 1620 ,  1720 ,  1820 or even to 1920 ;  pubs have to make money ,  and have to adapt to some extent to changing needs and expectations .

Much needs to be done .  The multi - roomed and historically - eclectic pub needs to be protected against the ravages of the all - over designer look .  As has been frequently pointed out , it is no use providing excellent beer or food if the pub in question has lost all of its charm and <head>atmosphere</head> ; and surely a multi - roomed pub , with a number of differing environments , is the best way to serve what is after all always a very diverse and unstandardised community . In 1976 the Lord Chief Justice ,  dismissing Bass Charrington 's  appeal against a proposal to open up the interior at the Romans Hotel in Southwick ,  Sussex ,  declared that it might be undesirable in the public interest to see more public bars disappearing and more mergers of public and saloon bars of the kind in question here In addition ,  far better liaison needs to be established between the breweries and local authority Conservation and Planning Officers ,  English Heritage ,  the National Amenity Societies ,  local civic bodies and ,  of course ,  pub landlords and their clientele over planned pub refurbishments .

Training To conclude this section it is necessary to point out a few things about the squad training sessions .

The second point is that you may be asked to take a drug test at any squad session .  If you refuse ,  you will be treated as though you had failed the test ,  and you will face a lifetime ban .

But in riding ,  quietness ,  and general environment ,  Mark 3 coaches gliding through the countryside at speed owe little to even a decade ago. Wall - to - wall carpeting , luggage racks running lengthways above the windows , supplemented by space for cases and bags between the seats , provide an uncluttered spaciousness to give a relaxed <head>atmosphere</head> on the longest of journeys . At least that is what it should be like .

Not all the results were of the same high quality ; nevertheless the music they arranged reinforced the choreographer 's design by giving the plot <head>atmosphere</head> , local colour , continuity and flow as well as giving the dancing its rhythmic vitality , emotion and mood . In some cases it also helped to underline the main moments in the action by emphasising gestures for greater strength and expression .  In other cases they added humour ,  most notably in Lanchbery 's  score for La Fille Mal Garde  ,  where several witty slants in the orchestration raise laughter ,  for example the music for the Cock and the Hens .

When Stravinsky composed The Firebird  he used leitmotifs in yet another way .  He created very distinctive passages of ascending chords to accompany the magic bird 's  flight through the trees .

Manner of moving the body as in walking ,  running ,  dancing ,  etc. If choreographers are to justify their reasons for creating a ballet ,  they should use or create a style of movement appropriate to and expressive of the characters in the story being told and their moods ,  emotions and actions .  The dancers or players in a theme ballet will need to convey the general <head>atmosphere</head> and any other element pertinent to the situation in which they find themselves , as well as the mood and content of the music chosen to give them phrasing . They will need to do the same if they are interpreting music .  Today there are many ballets which are created in the generally accepted styles from which choreographers can borrow :  classical ,  demi - caractre  ,  romantic ,  character and/or national ,  and modern  ( see pages 75138 )  .

( See also page 41 .  )  Rhythm in ballet is not therefore a mere time - keeper as it is in such social ballroom dances as waltzes and fox - trots .  A ballet fur the stage must have an overall rhythm which sets the <head>atmosphere</head> , quality , mood and possibly the emotional content of the whole . And ballet must also have short phrase rhythms which will give it variety ,  dimension ,  mass ,  structure ,  texture and style .

3 Once an outline of the story and a general layout of the plot have been decided ,  they should be discussed with the composer or arranger of music whose first task may be to create a proper beginning with the overture .  Is it to set the general <head>atmosphere</head> and mood as Stravinsky did for The Firebird Mysterious sounds of the wind whispering in the trees , the soaring flight of a bird and the heavy tread of an unseen foot are still a wonderful introduction to this magic tale . On the other hand ,  Prokofiev used his overture to Romeo and Juliet  to introduce the leitmotifs which will help both dancers and audience to follow the unfolding of the plot .  He contrasts the love themes of Romeo and Juliet with those which accompany the bitter struggles and fights between Montague and Capulet .

Despite the general activities there is menace in the air and it is not long before the rival factions of Montagues and Capulets are fighting and deaths occurring before the lovers even meet .  This opening is very different from the quietly charming first scene of A Month in the Country  ,  where the only thing amiss is Natalia 's  bored behaviour .  Even with such examples in mind the choreographer may well decide it is better to delay the confrontation between the chief players because , by creating and stressing the general <head>atmosphere</head> , this raises the audience 's expectations before the meeting of the protagonists , and the sudden onset of passion is what makes the ultimate tragedy so poignant . This happens in Giselle  where Hilarion 's  suspicions of Albrecht 's  identity are already aroused before Albrecht meets Giselle .  Hilarion 's  discovery of Albrecht 's  sword and later his confrontation with Giselle ,  with the sword in his hands ,  still does not convince Giselle of Albrecht 's  duplicity .

The events and circumstances surrounding such plots are difficult to control and organise because the characters are supposedly living in the real world .  So the choreographer cannot make strong contrasts between the style usually used for the other - worldly spirits and that used for the characters living in the particular setting .  He can only highlight the <head>atmosphere</head> supporting the plot , especially those circumstances where he has to portray differences between classes and thus general behaviour , idiosyncrasies , etc. , for example the contrast that must be made between the dances for all and sundry in the town square and those for the aristocrats in the ballroom of Romeo and Juliet . Nevertheless every choreographer creating this kind of romantic ballet today has to spend much time creating the proper gestures to replace the words ,  which in such ballets are never spoken but must be understood .  If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the characters they play .

If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the characters they play .  This is what happens in MacMillan 's  Romeo and Juliet  and Ashton 's  A Month in the Country  .  It is perhaps appropriate to stress again that where playwrights require pages of dialogue to explain every factor in the development of the plot , to create a changing <head>atmosphere</head> and to show how the actions affect the actors in the play , dancers can communicate whole passages of dialogue in a few expressive gestures woven into enchanements . ( As played by the Moscow Arts Theatre ,  Turgenev 's  A Month in the  Country  takes over two hours ,  Ashton 's  ballet roughly half an hour .  )  Only characters and episodes essential to the plot are retained .

Massine 's  brilliant use of descriptive and narrative gestures in The Three - Cornered  Hat  was a proper development of Fokine 's  mimed dance and danced mime ,  first seen in The Firebird  and Petrushka  .  As already noted ,  the dances Fokine staged for the nursemaids ,  coachmen and others at the Fair were real dances  ( see page 59 )  .  They created the <head>atmosphere</head> and mood , but the narrative was told by the dolls using specially created movements which could be called dances of character . Characters from the commedia dell'arte When Dauberval defined what he meant by dances of character he undoubtedly had in mind some easily recognised characters of the commedia dell'arte ,  whose actors regularly played such roles as the absent - minded doctor or scientist ,  miser ,  termagant wife or widow and various clowns such as the sad Pierrot or zany clown .

The dancing reflects the wartime <head>atmosphere</head> when shore leave was a cherished moment . Even though the boys and girls are figments of Robbins '  imagination ,  their brief encounter is based in reality even to the introduction of popular dance steps and stylistic elements current during the 193945 war .  Both the above - mentioned works show that ballets based on the life of real people require that choreographers closely observe the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of all types of person and that they make them recognisable in order that they convey meaning .

It is the very particular choreographic style that MacMillan created for the child - like figure in Requiem  that emphasises more strongly than any other of today 's  ballets the need for choreographers to explore dance itself .  Only when they have examined what hands ,  arms ,  legs and feet ,  body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story ,  theme or music ,  can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture ,  with the right quality ,  mood ,  emotion ,  action and character .  The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and , when needed , help to create the <head>atmosphere</head> and mood of the whole . Choreographers must then decide how many and which details they need to add to disclose the particular features of the story ,  theme and/or music that they wish to communicate .  The exploration of what each part of the body can express in isolation and then in co - ordination with the rest is possibly the most important aspect of a choreographer 's  work if it seeks to be modern in spirit and technique .

While we must support family rooms in those pubs which have the space and can provide suitable amusement for the little angels ,  this cannot remain the only answer to the problem .

Non - corpuscular radiation is in the form of high energy X rays which ,  assuming that the earth is in the path of the rays ,  will reach the earth in fifteen minutes .

These nuclear particles arrive at the F1 and F2 layers approximately 48 hours following a solar event and produce ionisation by colliding with gaseous molecules and cosmic particles .

Phoenix Park ,  at the top end of the biggest park in any European city ,  is altogether more atmospheric ,  with Tudor - style buildings ,  bookmakers who are just as happy to take and pay out in sterling as in punts ,  and bands and clowns to provide extra entertainment .  Racing and Ireland go together  it is said there are as many horses as people  ( three and a half million )   and racecourse crowds are extremely knowledgeable about the sport .  In an effort to create more <head>atmosphere</head> at Longchamp , Horse Racing Abroad , the chief transporter of Britons to French tracks , has its own grandstands , bars ( stocking drinks the British are used to ) , restaurants and betting facilities at the course to make its clients feel at home . And with the Arc such an established part of the racing scene ,  Paris will be bursting with Britons this weekend ,  with just a few hundred going on a punting pilgrimage to Dublin .

But it is surely silly to deny that it has thrown politicians and television journalists together in an association that remains totally invisible to the public .  In fact ,  thanks largely to Sir Robin Day  the Grand Inquisitor ,  as he calls himself in the title of his new book  the impression that the average viewer probably has of politics on television is that it is predominantly adversarial .  That may still be true of the set - piece studio interview though even there the prior indication of lines of questioning is by no means unknown ( and the viewer would probably be astonished at the general closeness of the <head>atmosphere</head> that prevails in the green room afterwards ) . Of course ,  television is a performing trade  and the very element of show business involved for both the interrogator and the victim was bound to have its effect on what Lord Beaverbrook used to proclaim as the armed frontier between politics and journalism .  Like a lot of Lord Beaverbrook 's  phrases ,  that was probably more colourful than accurate  but if such a frontier ever existed then the imperatives of current affairs television have certainly modified and adjusted it .

DANCE / Court in a trap :  Judith Mackrell reviews Ashley Page 's  Piano at The Royal Opera House By JUDITH MACKRELL ONE of the great achievements of Ashley Page 's new ballet , Piano , is its creation of an elusive but powerful <head>atmosphere</head> that completely over - rides its lack of plot . Without over - stating the case Piano recalls some of Ashton 's  work in the rich allusiveness of its world ,  mysteriously intimating other ballets ,  other stages and other lives .  The ballet is set to Beethoven 's  First Piano Concerto and Page and his designer ,  Howard Hodgkin ,  have responded to the formality and intimacy that they find in the score by conjuring a kind of post - modern Court .

The churchmen were less buoyant ,  having presented Mr de Klerk with a memorandum in which they listed six steps he had to take immediately before negotiations about the government 's  much - vaunted new political dispensation could start .  Archbishop Tutu said in a news conference after the meeting that he was concerned about Mr de Klerk 's  failure to give any specific undertakings .  However , no doubt mollified both by the President 's dramatic decision on Tuesday to announce the release of eight long - term political prisoners and by the urbanity of his style , the archbishop did note that the talks had proceeded in a far better <head>atmosphere</head> than previous encounters he has had with the government . Appearing to agree in part with Mr de Klerk 's  assessment of the meeting ,  the churchmen said they saw their role as facilitators to get negotiation going .  The six steps proposed by this celebrated trinity of black anti - apartheid leaders were :  lifting the state of emergency ;  lifting political restrictions on individuals ;  releasing all those detained without trial ;  unbanning political organisations ;  releasing all political prisoners ;  reprieving all those sentenced to death .

Roslavl ' officials would have lain quieter in  their beds at night if they had bothered to read Maxim Gorky 's  book On the Russian Peasantry  published that same year .  He pointed out that peasant opposition to government did exist ,  but on account of Russia 's  huge distances it expressed itself more by evasion than through open fighting .  This psychology naturally lingered on into the supposedly liberal <head>atmosphere</head> of NEP in the form of the utopian hope that obligations imposed from the Centre , as the peasants put it , could be avoided , whilst retaining economic rights . At the end of the winter of 19212 a cautious directive went out from Roslavl ' Party headquarters to all local head collectors of the tax in kind .  They were not to put undue pressure on the peasants themselves ,  but only on their fellow subordinate collectors .

One kolkhoz further to the north - east of Smolensk exchanged potatoes for farm machinery ,  whilst another shef factory that manufactured spare parts for linen plants gave iron to a local kolkhoz on its visits .  It insisted on calling a separate meeting for the kolkhoz women ,  so as to persuade them of their independence from their menfolk .  An undated set of questionnaires in the 1922 file for the Roslavl ' area reveals the prickly <head>atmosphere</head> that prevailed between the busybodies from the towns , as the rustics perceived them , and the primitive mores of the rustics themselves . When asked if their shefi acted in too authoritarian a manner ,  some kolkhozniki at first said it was very rare ,  but then in peasant  fashion slowly warmed up to the fact that they had been very angered by some young students who had written in Rabochii put  that their horses were badly fed and cleaned ,  and that they had not sown enough crops .  The arrogance of Bolshevik - inspired youth towards the patriarchal rural community also transpires from other criticisms directed against younger visitors .

The Plowden Report on Control of Public Expenditure  contained ,  amongst other nuggets of wisdom ,  the following sentence which I should like to take as my starting - point :  The social changes of the last fifteen years have altered the incidence of hardship ,  so that there now may well be excessive social services for some purposes and inadequate ones for others .

One was the need for reassurance in a world of visibly consolidating Great Powers  from the United States in the West to the Teutonic and Slav empires in Europe and the East .

In the 1890s the <head>atmosphere</head> was not of that settled calm with which it was credited by later and even more anxious generations . However confident the mass of the population may have felt in the durability of Britain 's  world role ,  those who ruled in Britain knew full well the kind of dangers the country faced and the need to take steps to meet them It would need a profound belief in providence to make one refrain from wondering why a group of foggy islands off Europe 's  north - western shores ,  populated beyond the means of subsistence that the islands could provide ,  endowed with no great natural assets outside the coalfields ,  should have become both the centre of a world empire and a possible arbiter of European rivalries .

Apart from Nigel Lawson ,  Nicholas Ridley ,  Cecil Parkinson ,  and Sir Geoffrey Howe ,  it was difficult to think of other Cabinet ministers who would be regarded as economically dry or ideologically Thatcherite ,  and both Lawson and Sir Geoffrey had well - publicized differences of opinion with Mrs Thatcher .  Mrs Thatcher 's  style certainly contributed to the Cabinet divisions between 1979 and 1981 and again after 1987 .  She has strong views on most issues and her propensity to express her views boldly at the outset of a Cabinet discussion , combined with a sometimes dismissive attitude towards opposing colleagues , tended to change the <head>atmosphere</head> and polarize Cabinet discussions . This contrasted with the approach of some other Prime Ministers .

Malawi has not been debilitated by localism ,  and experienced considerable economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s with a strong agricultural performance and an unusually effective civil service .

Nonetheless , the authoritarian nature of the regime has won it many enemies both inside and outside the country , creating an <head>atmosphere</head> of suspicion and intrigue amongst the educated elite . Furthermore ,  there is no sign that Dr Banda will be able to engineer a smooth and lasting transition to a leader with widespread popular support ,  and he thus endangers the achievements of his regime .

The subsequent tension between the two men created an <head>atmosphere</head> in which there were two attempted coups in 1983 , both emanating from sections of the army loyal to Ahidjo . By the end of the year ,  Biya felt strong enough to force a showdown with Ahidjo and the latter lost the position of party chairman while still abroad .  Ahidjo did not subsequently return to Cameroun ,  and in the presidential election of January 1984 Biya received a yes vote of over 90 per cent ,  which most Camerounians considered to be a genuine indication of his underlying support .

Apart from Wollen 's  historical and theoretical essay ,  the other major contribution in the Boston text is Thomas Y. Levin 's  Dismantling the Spectacle :  The Cinema of Guy Debord .

These initially hair - like fibres seek out and feed off the cellulose in the wood which is digested by the fungus to leave a dry ,  desiccated and fragile shell of wood - fibre or lignin which ,  in the absence of the cementitious cellulose ,  cannot continue to perform any structural role required of the timber .  Having drawn the cellulose from one section of the wood ,  the hyphae reach on to adjacent sections of timber to continue the process ,  while the strands of the initial attack unite into an equally fast - spreading cotton - wool - like growth known as mycelium .

When this action is well established ,  the fungus will produce a sporophore ,  or fruiting body ,  which produces millions of spores .  The sporophore is at first a whitish - grey ,  unpleasant - looking fleshy growth and gradually becomes more leathery and dewy .  It bursts at internals to release into the <head>atmosphere</head> an enormous number of rusty - red spores which are carried on the breeze to germinate in distant damp timber , starting the process afresh . Dry rot exhibits an almost uncanny knowledge of the presence of timber and is able to thrust through brickwork mortar joints and to travel across brickwork behind plaster over great distances in its search for fresh food .  In this respect ,  it is quite capable of spreading from one building to another through a thick party wall .

Touched by her husband 's  bringing her coffee Frau Nordern was in a good humour ,  dismissing her own worries about the accident as mere alarmism stoked by Bodo ,  and tempering her authoritarian ways by letting Paul stay in bed for an extra fifteen minutes instead of ,  as usual ,  rousing him in the manner of a sergeant in charge of a penal battalion .  The arrival of the mail helped ,  too :  a mound of letters from the relatives who were ,  or ,  if they were to be given free accommodation ,  thought that they were ,  coming to Uncle Karl 's  party .

This vine - leaf bowl with its cargo of glossy lemons comes from a pottery founded in the 1920s by a member of the Bloomsbury Group ,  Phyllis Keyes .

The pottery retains the <head>atmosphere</head> of a family business : the exclusive designs are hand - glazed with meticulous care , in colours that are themselves hand - mixed . There is a small stock in the pottery but most of the work is commissioned .  This bowl costs 70 ,  the fruit from 7 .

Nicholas Luard of the John Muir Trust  ( husband of our cookery writer Elisabeth Luard )  has joined forces with local people to form the Bara Ceirch Conservation Group ,  named after the farm on which the conifer plantation is sited .  The group is only too aware that the dangers of conifer plantations are not limited to creating great black tracts of sterile land  ( nothing grows beneath their dense needles )  .  More worryingly insidious is their ability to act as magnets to acid rain , taking it from the <head>atmosphere</head> and releasing it into the soil , where it leaches down and enters the water system . Nicholas Luard and the other members of the group were particularly concerned about the planting of conifers at Bara Ceirch farm as it stands at the headwaters of the Rivers Cothi and Towy ,  two of the finest salmon rivers in Wales .  The plantation itself is close to a feeder stream that runs straight into the Cothi ,  as would acid taken in by the conifers .

Last year he was invited to hold an exhibition of his work at Urbino ,  in central Italy ,  at the house once owned by the Renaissance painter Raphael ,  which he had visited a few years before .  It was the first time that such an offer had ever been made ;  initially ,  he was loath to put his sketches on public display  but he was also flattered .  Finally , after some agonizing , he agreed on the grounds , as he wrote in the introduction to the catalogue , that I have a passion for Italy , her people , her countryside and the way in which art quite naturally seems to invade every aspect of life , thereby producing an <head>atmosphere</head> that is totally irresistible . He sent the paintings but none were for sale .  As he explained in Urbino ,  These sketches are very much a part of myself and I am sure those who paint themselves will understand how hard it is to part with something into which ,  when inspired ,  you have poured your heart and soul .

But this was in many ways a blessing .  Too  many studios had been built in Britain during the production boom and ,  at a time when filmmakers were anyway keener than they had been hitherto to get out among ordinary people ,  they found they were no longer constrained by anxious accountants determined to maximize the use of studio space .  Among those who found wartime location shooting refreshing was the actor Michael Redgrave who credited much of the quality in The Way to the Stars ( 1945 ) , Asquith 's atmospheric picture about life on an airforce base , to the <head>atmosphere</head> of those three weeks at Catterick , which could never have been created in the studio . Filmmakers were constricted as to subject matter by the requirement that their films contribute in some way to the war effort .  That was the deal to keep British filmmakers in business which Alexander Korda had proposed to government ,  and supported with his propaganda film ,  The Lion Has Wings   ( 1939 )  ,  combining documentary footage with patriotic clips from earlier feature films and a contemporary narrative full of pontifications on Britain 's  purpose in going to war .

The UK government ,  following the example of the French and Italians ,  instituted measures to strengthen the ability of local producers to secure a reasonable return from the domestic box office ,  and filmmakers developed undemanding forms of cinema ,  mainly comedies and war films ,  that would reliably appeal to native audiences .  Meanwhile ,  cinema admissions declined steadily ,  from 1,365 million in 1951 to 501 million in 1961 ,  reinforcing the impression of limpness that hung around the whole of the British film industry .  The powerhouses of film production in the previous decade nearly all wilted in this <head>atmosphere</head> . Only Alexander Mackendrick at Ealing and David Lean seemed able ,  to some extent ,  to sustain their earlier initiatives ,  the one by focusing an acerbic eye on the state of England ,  the other by applying his extraordinary craftsmanship to such international films as The Bridge on the River Kwai   ( 1957 )  and Lawrence of Arabia   ( 1962 )  .  Powell and Pressburger made their last disillusioned statement on the post - war mood in The Small Back Room   ( 1949 )  ,  the story of an explosives expert 's  struggles against drink and pain that was their first film after the defection to Korda .

For Queen And Country  ( Sony )  is a tough and effective British urban western confronting racism and inner - city deprivation in uncomplacently stylised terms .  Representing a more traditional form of British cinema ,  John Schlesinger 's  Madame Sousatzka  ( Virgin )  has a stand - out performance by Shirley MacLaine and a keen eye for varied London locations ,  while A Time Of Destiny  ( Vestron )  is a baroque romantic melodrama from Gregory Nava  ( El Norte )  ,  which despite the miscasting of William Hurt as a Basque immigrant 's  son seemed to me to have been unfairly downgraded .  Another flawed but striking recent movie is DOA ( Buena Vista ) , an update from the creators of Max Headroom of the classic 1949 thriller of the same name , which may detrimentally alter the plot of the original but boasts nonetheless some arresting high - tech intimations of neo - expressionist <head>atmosphere</head> . Needing no alibis ,  however ,  though it comes close to an exploitation concept ,  is the hard - driving Australian movie Shame  ( Vestron )  ,  with a dynamic central performance by Deborra - Lee Furness as the city woman caught up in Outback violence .  Speaking of exploitation ,  students of the genre might care to consider Trapper County War  ( Guild )  ,  an archetypal example of the backwoods nightmare ,  set in one of those supposed hillbilly communities where the locals ,  when not spitting out tobacco or imprecations ,  are banding together to hunt down interlopers and blast them to bits .

Aura ,  a CBS recording made in Scandinavia four years ago  ( Davis went to WEA for his last two albums ,  after 30 years with Columbia )  ,  is as good a demonstration of that as anything the trumpeter has recorded since his most famous collaborations with Gil Evans .  It is an orchestral session featuring Danish musicians plus Davis ,  John McLaughlin on guitar ,  and Vince Wilburn on drums playing the Scandinavian trumpeter 's  Palle Mikkelborg 's  concerto for his hero ,  recorded in Copenhagen to accompany Miles 's  receipt of the Sonning Music Prize ,  a tribute whose earlier recipients have been Stravinsky ,  Leonard Bernstein ,  and Isaac Stern .

A famous passage of art criticism can be cited as one example entirely beyond dispute .  The author spent much of his life as a bachelor Fellow of Brasenose College Oxford ;  his cloistered life was devoted to writing ,  notably on classical antiquity and the Italian Renaissance .  Walter Pater was a master of <head>atmosphere</head> ; he had been inspired as a young man by Ruskin , and his idealism about art and his fine prose were in turn much admired by a younger generation of aesthetes , among whom Oscar Wilde was a prominent figure . One of Pater 's  subjects for a perceptive essay was Leonardo da Vinci ;  it gave special prominence to the painting now generally known as the Mona Lisa  .  The following critical passage comes from this piece ,  first published in the Fortnightly Review  in 1869 ,  and then in 1873 in Pater 's  book ,  Studies in the History of the Renaissance  .

They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,  partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro ,  who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,  was an open - minded historian of this sort .  He wrote enthusiastically about the later work of Arshile Gorky : Gorky 's <head>atmosphere</head> , veiling the hard opaque wall of the canvas , evokes a nocturnal void or the vague , unstable image - space of the day - dreaming mind . And he remembered the painter :  I used to meet him most often in the museums and galleries fixed in rapt contemplation of pictures with that grave ,  searching look which was one of the beauties of his face .

Beneath a sultry sky ,  at four o'clock ,  the island ,  boats slipping past its flank ,  stirring with a casual Sunday crowd enjoying the fresh air among the trees ;  and these forty or so figures are endowed with a succinct ,  hieratic line The <head>atmosphere</head> is transparent and uncommonly vibrant ; the surface seems to flicker or glimmer . Fnon ,  like other excellent critics ,  was a valued friend of artists ,  and so he remained all his life even though he gave up writing criticism after a decade of working on the Revue blanche  from 1893 to 1903 .  He accepted a position in a dealer 's  gallery ,  where Matisse was among the artists who benefited from his judgement .

Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage  the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the audience are vitally connected to what is going on .  As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself ,  and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for .  Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 , scene 1 of Henry V , which draws the audience into the <head>atmosphere</head> before a battle enormously effectively ) . It is also used as a dramatic device by many contemporary playwrights .   The film is a very distinct dramatic medium .

In fact ,  whereas the parallel protestant movement of evangelical revival was for all people ,  and the issue tended to be decisive ,  catholic spirituality diverged on both points .  The principal one was that conversion and growth were particularly directed at the clerical - religious lite ,  where the annual retreat system formed the annual or biennial centre of the individual spiritual life .  The retreat consisted , and still does , of anything from five to thirty days of spiritual exercises , usually in an <head>atmosphere</head> of silence and contemplation apart from listening to the preacher when there is one , but with additional features of both vocal and silent prayer . The laity had a pale reflection of this programme in the parish mission ,  designed to convert the laity or at least bring them back to regular church practices .  Morality was for the laity ,  whose life was dominated by the battle against mortal sin ,  and who therefore lived under the threat of hell and were always at risk .

The pressure to remodel old pubs is of course nothing new .  The Victorian and Edwardian eras witnessed many wholesale rebuildings of modest Georgian drinking - houses ;  during the Interwar period even more money was pumped into enlarging and rebuilding old pubs ,  as well as in creating large new ones  ( see Alan Powers '  essay below )  .  However , alterations were more often than not effected with some degree of sympathy for the existing fabric and <head>atmosphere</head> . With the advent of postwar Modernism much of this sympathy evaporated .  The ascetic modernists '  rejection of history in order to create a visionary brave New World was clearly incompatible with the historic pub .

The ascetic modernists '  rejection of history in order to create a visionary brave New World was clearly incompatible with the historic pub .  This attitude was amply revealed in the results of the competition  ( Inside the Pub )  launched jointly by The Architectural Review   and The Brewers '  Society in 1949 .  In October of that year the AR regretted that nearly all competition entries had evaded the key problem and had signally failed to achieve the genuine pub <head>atmosphere</head> . Contemporary design ,  the magazine 's  editor regretted ,  because it has no roots in the vernacular idiom will not appear immediately familiar ,  whilst the mock - Tudor and the mock - Georgian styles which have been so prevalent  no matter how misguided in themselves  have sprung from a genuine attempt to preserve a traditional atmosphere .  As pub designer Tim May noted in his address to CAMRA 's  AGM of 1990 :  By any objective standards ,  the competition was a disaster .

A pub ,  like any other old building ,  is far more than just its principle facade ,  or its four walls .  As Neil Richardson noted in 1980 ,  An old town pub is not just an attractive Victorian or Georgian facade ,  it is a building which is still being used for the purpose for which it was built .  The design of interiors are as valid today as they were in earlier times the vaults , snugs , parlours , each with their own character , can still provide a pleasant , varied <head>atmosphere</head> . However ,  to public and professionals alike many old buildings are still regarded as representing little more than four external walls .  This even applies to listed buildings :  there is still a worryingly widespread general belief that listing only covers the facade ,  or perhaps just the exterior ,  whereas it is of course expressly designed to protect the whole  building .

This is especially true of those pubs now targeted by the breweries as centres for family eating .  A traditional interior does not have to be incompatible with accommodating whole families ,  nor with providing meals ;  yet an increasing number of old pub interiors are being sacrificed on the altar of the identikit eating house  whether the brewer 's  concept be a downmarket steakhouse or part of a family restaurant chain masquerading as an independent local concern .  Many of the interiors created by the designers of such facilities are as forbidding as the old - fashioned spit - and - sawdust pub ; any lingering <head>atmosphere</head> is swept away in a barrage of stained wood and fake Victoriana , and any casual visitors made to feel inordinately guilty if they do not , alas , wish to eat . The subjugation of individual character in such cases  which on occasion even involves the removal of all traces of the pub 's  actual name  is particularly depressing .  The aim of this report is not to demand that brewers turn the block back to 1620 ,  1720 ,  1820 or even to 1920 ;  pubs have to make money ,  and have to adapt to some extent to changing needs and expectations .

Much needs to be done .  The multi - roomed and historically - eclectic pub needs to be protected against the ravages of the all - over designer look .  As has been frequently pointed out , it is no use providing excellent beer or food if the pub in question has lost all of its charm and <head>atmosphere</head> ; and surely a multi - roomed pub , with a number of differing environments , is the best way to serve what is after all always a very diverse and unstandardised community . In 1976 the Lord Chief Justice ,  dismissing Bass Charrington 's  appeal against a proposal to open up the interior at the Romans Hotel in Southwick ,  Sussex ,  declared that it might be undesirable in the public interest to see more public bars disappearing and more mergers of public and saloon bars of the kind in question here In addition ,  far better liaison needs to be established between the breweries and local authority Conservation and Planning Officers ,  English Heritage ,  the National Amenity Societies ,  local civic bodies and ,  of course ,  pub landlords and their clientele over planned pub refurbishments .

Training To conclude this section it is necessary to point out a few things about the squad training sessions .  Firstly , karateka are not allowed to bring their own coaches with them to training sessions because experience has shown that the presence of other coaches breaks up the training <head>atmosphere</head> , and causes people to separate to far corners instead of remaining together . The second point is that you may be asked to take a drug test at any squad session .  If you refuse ,  you will be treated as though you had failed the test ,  and you will face a lifetime ban .

It had looked like a melodrama  a little group in a candle - lit attic ,  holding up their arms with fists clenched and swearing to do or die .

The hills themselves looked asleep ,  the heather glowed dust - blue in the hazy light ,  and the people ,  after a night of little sleep and hours of walking and standing ,  now looked stunned as they sat on the grassy banks ,  leaned on dykes ,  or lay on their backs in the hayfields ,  munching oatcakes and drinking the last of their water .

For every four windows on a Mark 3 standard - class coach there are four and a hf bays of seats ,  only the end bays matching the windows and succeeding bays being more tightly spaced so that some passengers are seated against a blank wall .  But in riding ,  quietness ,  and general environment ,  Mark 3 coaches gliding through the countryside at speed owe little to even a decade ago. Wall - to - wall carpeting , luggage racks running lengthways above the windows , supplemented by space for cases and bags between the seats , provide an uncluttered spaciousness to give a relaxed <head>atmosphere</head> on the longest of journeys . At least that is what it should be like .  The upsurge in traffic in the 1980s has alas meant that passengers have often had to stand in the centre aisles ,  in the lobbies ,  and around the door vestibules .

Not all the results were of the same high quality ; nevertheless the music they arranged reinforced the choreographer 's design by giving the plot <head>atmosphere</head> , local colour , continuity and flow as well as giving the dancing its rhythmic vitality , emotion and mood . In some cases it also helped to underline the main moments in the action by emphasising gestures for greater strength and expression .  In other cases they added humour ,  most notably in Lanchbery 's  score for La Fille Mal Garde  ,  where several witty slants in the orchestration raise laughter ,  for example the music for the Cock and the Hens .

When Stravinsky composed The Firebird  he used leitmotifs in yet another way .  He created very distinctive passages of ascending chords to accompany the magic bird 's  flight through the trees .

Manner of moving the body as in walking ,  running ,  dancing ,  etc. If choreographers are to justify their reasons for creating a ballet ,  they should use or create a style of movement appropriate to and expressive of the characters in the story being told and their moods ,  emotions and actions .  The dancers or players in a theme ballet will need to convey the general <head>atmosphere</head> and any other element pertinent to the situation in which they find themselves , as well as the mood and content of the music chosen to give them phrasing . They will need to do the same if they are interpreting music .  Today there are many ballets which are created in the generally accepted styles from which choreographers can borrow :  classical ,  demi - caractre  ,  romantic ,  character and/or national ,  and modern  ( see pages 75138 )  .

( See also page 41 .  )  Rhythm in ballet is not therefore a mere time - keeper as it is in such social ballroom dances as waltzes and fox - trots .  A ballet fur the stage must have an overall rhythm which sets the <head>atmosphere</head> , quality , mood and possibly the emotional content of the whole . And ballet must also have short phrase rhythms which will give it variety ,  dimension ,  mass ,  structure ,  texture and style .

3 Once an outline of the story and a general layout of the plot have been decided ,  they should be discussed with the composer or arranger of music whose first task may be to create a proper beginning with the overture .  Is it to set the general <head>atmosphere</head> and mood as Stravinsky did for The Firebird Mysterious sounds of the wind whispering in the trees , the soaring flight of a bird and the heavy tread of an unseen foot are still a wonderful introduction to this magic tale . On the other hand ,  Prokofiev used his overture to Romeo and Juliet  to introduce the leitmotifs which will help both dancers and audience to follow the unfolding of the plot .  He contrasts the love themes of Romeo and Juliet with those which accompany the bitter struggles and fights between Montague and Capulet .

Despite the general activities there is menace in the air and it is not long before the rival factions of Montagues and Capulets are fighting and deaths occurring before the lovers even meet .  This opening is very different from the quietly charming first scene of A Month in the Country  ,  where the only thing amiss is Natalia 's  bored behaviour .  Even with such examples in mind the choreographer may well decide it is better to delay the confrontation between the chief players because , by creating and stressing the general <head>atmosphere</head> , this raises the audience 's expectations before the meeting of the protagonists , and the sudden onset of passion is what makes the ultimate tragedy so poignant . This happens in Giselle  where Hilarion 's  suspicions of Albrecht 's  identity are already aroused before Albrecht meets Giselle .  Hilarion 's  discovery of Albrecht 's  sword and later his confrontation with Giselle ,  with the sword in his hands ,  still does not convince Giselle of Albrecht 's  duplicity .

The events and circumstances surrounding such plots are difficult to control and organise because the characters are supposedly living in the real world .  So the choreographer cannot make strong contrasts between the style usually used for the other - worldly spirits and that used for the characters living in the particular setting .  He can only highlight the <head>atmosphere</head> supporting the plot , especially those circumstances where he has to portray differences between classes and thus general behaviour , idiosyncrasies , etc. , for example the contrast that must be made between the dances for all and sundry in the town square and those for the aristocrats in the ballroom of Romeo and Juliet . Nevertheless every choreographer creating this kind of romantic ballet today has to spend much time creating the proper gestures to replace the words ,  which in such ballets are never spoken but must be understood .  If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the characters they play .

If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the characters they play .  This is what happens in MacMillan 's  Romeo and Juliet  and Ashton 's  A Month in the Country  .  It is perhaps appropriate to stress again that where playwrights require pages of dialogue to explain every factor in the development of the plot , to create a changing <head>atmosphere</head> and to show how the actions affect the actors in the play , dancers can communicate whole passages of dialogue in a few expressive gestures woven into enchanements . ( As played by the Moscow Arts Theatre ,  Turgenev 's  A Month in the  Country  takes over two hours ,  Ashton 's  ballet roughly half an hour .  )  Only characters and episodes essential to the plot are retained .

Massine 's  brilliant use of descriptive and narrative gestures in The Three - Cornered  Hat  was a proper development of Fokine 's  mimed dance and danced mime ,  first seen in The Firebird  and Petrushka  .  As already noted ,  the dances Fokine staged for the nursemaids ,  coachmen and others at the Fair were real dances  ( see page 59 )  .  They created the <head>atmosphere</head> and mood , but the narrative was told by the dolls using specially created movements which could be called dances of character . Characters from the commedia dell'arte When Dauberval defined what he meant by dances of character he undoubtedly had in mind some easily recognised characters of the commedia dell'arte ,  whose actors regularly played such roles as the absent - minded doctor or scientist ,  miser ,  termagant wife or widow and various clowns such as the sad Pierrot or zany clown .

The dancing reflects the wartime <head>atmosphere</head> when shore leave was a cherished moment . Even though the boys and girls are figments of Robbins '  imagination ,  their brief encounter is based in reality even to the introduction of popular dance steps and stylistic elements current during the 193945 war .  Both the above - mentioned works show that ballets based on the life of real people require that choreographers closely observe the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of all types of person and that they make them recognisable in order that they convey meaning .

It is the very particular choreographic style that MacMillan created for the child - like figure in Requiem  that emphasises more strongly than any other of today 's  ballets the need for choreographers to explore dance itself .  Only when they have examined what hands ,  arms ,  legs and feet ,  body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story ,  theme or music ,  can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture ,  with the right quality ,  mood ,  emotion ,  action and character .  The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and , when needed , help to create the <head>atmosphere</head> and mood of the whole . Choreographers must then decide how many and which details they need to add to disclose the particular features of the story ,  theme and/or music that they wish to communicate .  The exploration of what each part of the body can express in isolation and then in co - ordination with the rest is possibly the most important aspect of a choreographer 's  work if it seeks to be modern in spirit and technique .

While we must support family rooms in those pubs which have the space and can provide suitable amusement for the little angels ,  this cannot remain the only answer to the problem .

Non - corpuscular radiation is in the form of high energy X rays which ,  assuming that the earth is in the path of the rays ,  will reach the earth in fifteen minutes .

These nuclear particles arrive at the F1 and F2 layers approximately 48 hours following a solar event and produce ionisation by colliding with gaseous molecules and cosmic particles .

Phoenix Park ,  at the top end of the biggest park in any European city ,  is altogether more atmospheric ,  with Tudor - style buildings ,  bookmakers who are just as happy to take and pay out in sterling as in punts ,  and bands and clowns to provide extra entertainment .  Racing and Ireland go together  it is said there are as many horses as people  ( three and a half million )   and racecourse crowds are extremely knowledgeable about the sport .  In an effort to create more <head>atmosphere</head> at Longchamp , Horse Racing Abroad , the chief transporter of Britons to French tracks , has its own grandstands , bars ( stocking drinks the British are used to ) , restaurants and betting facilities at the course to make its clients feel at home . And with the Arc such an established part of the racing scene ,  Paris will be bursting with Britons this weekend ,  with just a few hundred going on a punting pilgrimage to Dublin .

But it is surely silly to deny that it has thrown politicians and television journalists together in an association that remains totally invisible to the public .  In fact ,  thanks largely to Sir Robin Day  the Grand Inquisitor ,  as he calls himself in the title of his new book  the impression that the average viewer probably has of politics on television is that it is predominantly adversarial .  That may still be true of the set - piece studio interview though even there the prior indication of lines of questioning is by no means unknown ( and the viewer would probably be astonished at the general closeness of the <head>atmosphere</head> that prevails in the green room afterwards ) . Of course ,  television is a performing trade  and the very element of show business involved for both the interrogator and the victim was bound to have its effect on what Lord Beaverbrook used to proclaim as the armed frontier between politics and journalism .  Like a lot of Lord Beaverbrook 's  phrases ,  that was probably more colourful than accurate  but if such a frontier ever existed then the imperatives of current affairs television have certainly modified and adjusted it .

DANCE / Court in a trap :  Judith Mackrell reviews Ashley Page 's  Piano at The Royal Opera House By JUDITH MACKRELL ONE of the great achievements of Ashley Page 's new ballet , Piano , is its creation of an elusive but powerful <head>atmosphere</head> that completely over - rides its lack of plot . Without over - stating the case Piano recalls some of Ashton 's  work in the rich allusiveness of its world ,  mysteriously intimating other ballets ,  other stages and other lives .  The ballet is set to Beethoven 's  First Piano Concerto and Page and his designer ,  Howard Hodgkin ,  have responded to the formality and intimacy that they find in the score by conjuring a kind of post - modern Court .

The churchmen were less buoyant ,  having presented Mr de Klerk with a memorandum in which they listed six steps he had to take immediately before negotiations about the government 's  much - vaunted new political dispensation could start .  Archbishop Tutu said in a news conference after the meeting that he was concerned about Mr de Klerk 's  failure to give any specific undertakings .  However , no doubt mollified both by the President 's dramatic decision on Tuesday to announce the release of eight long - term political prisoners and by the urbanity of his style , the archbishop did note that the talks had proceeded in a far better <head>atmosphere</head> than previous encounters he has had with the government . Appearing to agree in part with Mr de Klerk 's  assessment of the meeting ,  the churchmen said they saw their role as facilitators to get negotiation going .  The six steps proposed by this celebrated trinity of black anti - apartheid leaders were :  lifting the state of emergency ;  lifting political restrictions on individuals ;  releasing all those detained without trial ;  unbanning political organisations ;  releasing all political prisoners ;  reprieving all those sentenced to death .

Roslavl ' officials would have lain quieter in  their beds at night if they had bothered to read Maxim Gorky 's  book On the Russian Peasantry  published that same year .  He pointed out that peasant opposition to government did exist ,  but on account of Russia 's  huge distances it expressed itself more by evasion than through open fighting .  This psychology naturally lingered on into the supposedly liberal <head>atmosphere</head> of NEP in the form of the utopian hope that obligations imposed from the Centre , as the peasants put it , could be avoided , whilst retaining economic rights . At the end of the winter of 19212 a cautious directive went out from Roslavl ' Party headquarters to all local head collectors of the tax in kind .  They were not to put undue pressure on the peasants themselves ,  but only on their fellow subordinate collectors .

One kolkhoz further to the north - east of Smolensk exchanged potatoes for farm machinery ,  whilst another shef factory that manufactured spare parts for linen plants gave iron to a local kolkhoz on its visits .  It insisted on calling a separate meeting for the kolkhoz women ,  so as to persuade them of their independence from their menfolk .  An undated set of questionnaires in the 1922 file for the Roslavl ' area reveals the prickly <head>atmosphere</head> that prevailed between the busybodies from the towns , as the rustics perceived them , and the primitive mores of the rustics themselves . When asked if their shefi acted in too authoritarian a manner ,  some kolkhozniki at first said it was very rare ,  but then in peasant  fashion slowly warmed up to the fact that they had been very angered by some young students who had written in Rabochii put  that their horses were badly fed and cleaned ,  and that they had not sown enough crops .  The arrogance of Bolshevik - inspired youth towards the patriarchal rural community also transpires from other criticisms directed against younger visitors .

The Plowden Report on Control of Public Expenditure  contained ,  amongst other nuggets of wisdom ,  the following sentence which I should like to take as my starting - point :  The social changes of the last fifteen years have altered the incidence of hardship ,  so that there now may well be excessive social services for some purposes and inadequate ones for others .

One was the need for reassurance in a world of visibly consolidating Great Powers  from the United States in the West to the Teutonic and Slav empires in Europe and the East .

In the 1890s the <head>atmosphere</head> was not of that settled calm with which it was credited by later and even more anxious generations . However confident the mass of the population may have felt in the durability of Britain 's  world role ,  those who ruled in Britain knew full well the kind of dangers the country faced and the need to take steps to meet them It would need a profound belief in providence to make one refrain from wondering why a group of foggy islands off Europe 's  north - western shores ,  populated beyond the means of subsistence that the islands could provide ,  endowed with no great natural assets outside the coalfields ,  should have become both the centre of a world empire and a possible arbiter of European rivalries .

Apart from Nigel Lawson ,  Nicholas Ridley ,  Cecil Parkinson ,  and Sir Geoffrey Howe ,  it was difficult to think of other Cabinet ministers who would be regarded as economically dry or ideologically Thatcherite ,  and both Lawson and Sir Geoffrey had well - publicized differences of opinion with Mrs Thatcher .  Mrs Thatcher 's  style certainly contributed to the Cabinet divisions between 1979 and 1981 and again after 1987 .  She has strong views on most issues and her propensity to express her views boldly at the outset of a Cabinet discussion , combined with a sometimes dismissive attitude towards opposing colleagues , tended to change the <head>atmosphere</head> and polarize Cabinet discussions . This contrasted with the approach of some other Prime Ministers .

Malawi has not been debilitated by localism ,  and experienced considerable economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s with a strong agricultural performance and an unusually effective civil service .

Nonetheless , the authoritarian nature of the regime has won it many enemies both inside and outside the country , creating an <head>atmosphere</head> of suspicion and intrigue amongst the educated elite . Furthermore ,  there is no sign that Dr Banda will be able to engineer a smooth and lasting transition to a leader with widespread popular support ,  and he thus endangers the achievements of his regime .

The subsequent tension between the two men created an <head>atmosphere</head> in which there were two attempted coups in 1983 , both emanating from sections of the army loyal to Ahidjo . By the end of the year ,  Biya felt strong enough to force a showdown with Ahidjo and the latter lost the position of party chairman while still abroad .  Ahidjo did not subsequently return to Cameroun ,  and in the presidential election of January 1984 Biya received a yes vote of over 90 per cent ,  which most Camerounians considered to be a genuine indication of his underlying support .

Apart from Wollen 's  historical and theoretical essay ,  the other major contribution in the Boston text is Thomas Y. Levin 's  Dismantling the Spectacle :  The Cinema of Guy Debord .

These initially hair - like fibres seek out and feed off the cellulose in the wood which is digested by the fungus to leave a dry ,  desiccated and fragile shell of wood - fibre or lignin which ,  in the absence of the cementitious cellulose ,  cannot continue to perform any structural role required of the timber .  Having drawn the cellulose from one section of the wood ,  the hyphae reach on to adjacent sections of timber to continue the process ,  while the strands of the initial attack unite into an equally fast - spreading cotton - wool - like growth known as mycelium .

When this action is well established ,  the fungus will produce a sporophore ,  or fruiting body ,  which produces millions of spores .  The sporophore is at first a whitish - grey ,  unpleasant - looking fleshy growth and gradually becomes more leathery and dewy .  It bursts at internals to release into the <head>atmosphere</head> an enormous number of rusty - red spores which are carried on the breeze to germinate in distant damp timber , starting the process afresh . Dry rot exhibits an almost uncanny knowledge of the presence of timber and is able to thrust through brickwork mortar joints and to travel across brickwork behind plaster over great distances in its search for fresh food .  In this respect ,  it is quite capable of spreading from one building to another through a thick party wall .

Touched by her husband 's  bringing her coffee Frau Nordern was in a good humour ,  dismissing her own worries about the accident as mere alarmism stoked by Bodo ,  and tempering her authoritarian ways by letting Paul stay in bed for an extra fifteen minutes instead of ,  as usual ,  rousing him in the manner of a sergeant in charge of a penal battalion .  The arrival of the mail helped ,  too :  a mound of letters from the relatives who were ,  or ,  if they were to be given free accommodation ,  thought that they were ,  coming to Uncle Karl 's  party .

This vine - leaf bowl with its cargo of glossy lemons comes from a pottery founded in the 1920s by a member of the Bloomsbury Group ,  Phyllis Keyes .

The pottery retains the <head>atmosphere</head> of a family business : the exclusive designs are hand - glazed with meticulous care , in colours that are themselves hand - mixed . There is a small stock in the pottery but most of the work is commissioned .  This bowl costs 70 ,  the fruit from 7 .

Nicholas Luard of the John Muir Trust  ( husband of our cookery writer Elisabeth Luard )  has joined forces with local people to form the Bara Ceirch Conservation Group ,  named after the farm on which the conifer plantation is sited .  The group is only too aware that the dangers of conifer plantations are not limited to creating great black tracts of sterile land  ( nothing grows beneath their dense needles )  .  More worryingly insidious is their ability to act as magnets to acid rain , taking it from the <head>atmosphere</head> and releasing it into the soil , where it leaches down and enters the water system . Nicholas Luard and the other members of the group were particularly concerned about the planting of conifers at Bara Ceirch farm as it stands at the headwaters of the Rivers Cothi and Towy ,  two of the finest salmon rivers in Wales .  The plantation itself is close to a feeder stream that runs straight into the Cothi ,  as would acid taken in by the conifers .

Last year he was invited to hold an exhibition of his work at Urbino ,  in central Italy ,  at the house once owned by the Renaissance painter Raphael ,  which he had visited a few years before .  It was the first time that such an offer had ever been made ;  initially ,  he was loath to put his sketches on public display  but he was also flattered .  Finally , after some agonizing , he agreed on the grounds , as he wrote in the introduction to the catalogue , that I have a passion for Italy , her people , her countryside and the way in which art quite naturally seems to invade every aspect of life , thereby producing an <head>atmosphere</head> that is totally irresistible . He sent the paintings but none were for sale .  As he explained in Urbino ,  These sketches are very much a part of myself and I am sure those who paint themselves will understand how hard it is to part with something into which ,  when inspired ,  you have poured your heart and soul .

But this was in many ways a blessing .  Too  many studios had been built in Britain during the production boom and ,  at a time when filmmakers were anyway keener than they had been hitherto to get out among ordinary people ,  they found they were no longer constrained by anxious accountants determined to maximize the use of studio space .  Among those who found wartime location shooting refreshing was the actor Michael Redgrave who credited much of the quality in The Way to the Stars ( 1945 ) , Asquith 's atmospheric picture about life on an airforce base , to the <head>atmosphere</head> of those three weeks at Catterick , which could never have been created in the studio . Filmmakers were constricted as to subject matter by the requirement that their films contribute in some way to the war effort .  That was the deal to keep British filmmakers in business which Alexander Korda had proposed to government ,  and supported with his propaganda film ,  The Lion Has Wings   ( 1939 )  ,  combining documentary footage with patriotic clips from earlier feature films and a contemporary narrative full of pontifications on Britain 's  purpose in going to war .

The UK government ,  following the example of the French and Italians ,  instituted measures to strengthen the ability of local producers to secure a reasonable return from the domestic box office ,  and filmmakers developed undemanding forms of cinema ,  mainly comedies and war films ,  that would reliably appeal to native audiences .  Meanwhile ,  cinema admissions declined steadily ,  from 1,365 million in 1951 to 501 million in 1961 ,  reinforcing the impression of limpness that hung around the whole of the British film industry .  The powerhouses of film production in the previous decade nearly all wilted in this <head>atmosphere</head> . Only Alexander Mackendrick at Ealing and David Lean seemed able ,  to some extent ,  to sustain their earlier initiatives ,  the one by focusing an acerbic eye on the state of England ,  the other by applying his extraordinary craftsmanship to such international films as The Bridge on the River Kwai   ( 1957 )  and Lawrence of Arabia   ( 1962 )  .  Powell and Pressburger made their last disillusioned statement on the post - war mood in The Small Back Room   ( 1949 )  ,  the story of an explosives expert 's  struggles against drink and pain that was their first film after the defection to Korda .

For Queen And Country  ( Sony )  is a tough and effective British urban western confronting racism and inner - city deprivation in uncomplacently stylised terms .  Representing a more traditional form of British cinema ,  John Schlesinger 's  Madame Sousatzka  ( Virgin )  has a stand - out performance by Shirley MacLaine and a keen eye for varied London locations ,  while A Time Of Destiny  ( Vestron )  is a baroque romantic melodrama from Gregory Nava  ( El Norte )  ,  which despite the miscasting of William Hurt as a Basque immigrant 's  son seemed to me to have been unfairly downgraded .  Another flawed but striking recent movie is DOA ( Buena Vista ) , an update from the creators of Max Headroom of the classic 1949 thriller of the same name , which may detrimentally alter the plot of the original but boasts nonetheless some arresting high - tech intimations of neo - expressionist <head>atmosphere</head> . Needing no alibis ,  however ,  though it comes close to an exploitation concept ,  is the hard - driving Australian movie Shame  ( Vestron )  ,  with a dynamic central performance by Deborra - Lee Furness as the city woman caught up in Outback violence .  Speaking of exploitation ,  students of the genre might care to consider Trapper County War  ( Guild )  ,  an archetypal example of the backwoods nightmare ,  set in one of those supposed hillbilly communities where the locals ,  when not spitting out tobacco or imprecations ,  are banding together to hunt down interlopers and blast them to bits .

Aura ,  a CBS recording made in Scandinavia four years ago  ( Davis went to WEA for his last two albums ,  after 30 years with Columbia )  ,  is as good a demonstration of that as anything the trumpeter has recorded since his most famous collaborations with Gil Evans .  It is an orchestral session featuring Danish musicians plus Davis ,  John McLaughlin on guitar ,  and Vince Wilburn on drums playing the Scandinavian trumpeter 's  Palle Mikkelborg 's  concerto for his hero ,  recorded in Copenhagen to accompany Miles 's  receipt of the Sonning Music Prize ,  a tribute whose earlier recipients have been Stravinsky ,  Leonard Bernstein ,  and Isaac Stern .
