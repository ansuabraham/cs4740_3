  Our word sense disambiguation algorithm will make use of the NLTK toolkit.  The algorithm will take in a list of word senses matched with a dictionary of features as input.  The training set contains words that are tagged with word senses.  The algorithm will pass through the training set and extract all of the features for each word and put them into a dictionary.  Then the word and the dictionary will be added to the list and passed into the machine learning algorithm from the NLTK toolkit.  The toolkit contains both the Decision Lists and the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithms.  We plan to use both in our experiments to determine which one is more effective.  Also, if we have enough time, we will implement the bootstrapping algorithm.  After training the machine learning algorithm, the test file will be passed in and the senses of the words will be determined.  Depending on the time it takes for the algorithm to execute, we may attempt the all-words task because the algorithm should be general enough to complete it.

  Our experiment will use forward stepwise feature addition to decide which features are the most important.  We plan on using colocation features, cooccurrance features, part-of-speech tagging, parser-based part of speech tagging, optimal word picking, and sentence length as features. We also plan to try to find other interesting features and try those out as well.
