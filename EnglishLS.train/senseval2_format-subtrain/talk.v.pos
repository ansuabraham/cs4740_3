During the first 11 months of 1990 AI sent 68 delegates to 50 countries ranging from Jordan to Nepal ,  from the USA to Romania .  Despite the difficulties of getting into and travelling around many of these countries  due to poor roads ,  curfews ,  civil wars ,  monsoons  researchers often uncover information and testimony they would never otherwise obtain .

The hills smoke ,  mounds of rubbish smoulder ,  the verges of the roads are charred .  All this is felt to  testify ,  not just to a general rankness and decay ,  but to a conflagration of another kind  to what will happen if the political and racial tensions of the island can no longer be contained .  Gangs and guerrillas are talked of Wealthy people are <head>talking</head> of escape from a Caribbean version of James Baldwin 's the fire next time . A white woman named Jane has come here from London ,  drawn by the glamour of the Third World ,  supposing herself to have arrived where the action is ,  where the doers are .

But it does not take long to decide that the experiment is being conducted with skill ,  and that the pursuits have at least a little in common .  A piece of oral history may be meant to do without a presiding historian in much the same way in which an analytic session may be meant to do without a presiding analyst ;  theoretical presuppositions are subject in each case to a show of suspension ,  though it is clear that the theories of Freud and others will be present in the consulting - room ,  and that oral historians may be sympathetic to socialism and to the methods of  Marxist historiography .  Fraser 's book is not without its evident presuppositions , and not every reader will feel that this autobiographer , having perused and digested his tape - recordings , <head>talked</head> to his analyst and completed his inner and outer voyages , knew something radically different about his past from what he had known before : that something had been found , or proved . He had lived with his past for the best part of fifty years ,  and his book tells what he had come to know of it over that interval of time ,  with help from the theories of Marx and Freud .  And in so doing it can often convey that a past is not a thing to be discovered .

They are tales ,  moreover ,  which do n't do all that much to summon the nostalgic reader .  They do n't direct us to the late survival of a gypsy  paradise .  Nevertheless , they contain persuasive evidence to indicate that there was more for his people to do , and <head>talk</head> about , that there was more fun , than there is now in some parts of urban Scotland . Less persuasively ,  a people which has had to defend itself against an enduring hostility is shown ,  for the most part ,  as free from fear ,  and ,  in particular ,  from the fear that exceeds and mistakes its objects .  Those under threat in the cities have not always been so lucky .

But there is no trick to the business of learning lines ,  as you will find out as you go on  although learning lines for an audition is different from memorising a part in a play for production ,  because then you will be operating with other actors around you .  On the whole ,  acting in isolation is a peculiar feature of the audition system ,  which is why the pieces you choose in either the classic or modern text need to be reasonably well contained and lend themselves to being performed as a one man show .  If you have done any class work before attempting the drama school audition , most of the teachers will at some point in their sessions have <head>talked</head> about relaxation . A lot has to do with how you breathe and how you react physically to moments of tension .  You will be tense at the audition because a lot is at stake ,  but if you trust to your own natural resources ,  the degree of panic can be reduced .

Comment This character has a northern accent and the fact is important to the handling of the piece .  He is on his own and definitely <head>talking</head> aloud to himself in the privacy of his room . There is no need to over - play the slightly pathetic quality but seek out the eagerness of his search for something to do .  His imitations of other voices calls for a good sense of mimicry ,  and should bring the dreariness of his life into focus .

This is a pity ,  as it means that students find it harder to get their names known ,  and it means they lose out on a degree of publicity .  The private tutorial In the last terms of the diploma course students often find tutorials , where they are given opportunity to <head>talk</head> about work in progress , enormously valuable . The tutorial is completely  distinct from an audition class ;  the object of the tutorial is to help a student concentrate on speeches and scenes which may extend aspects of characterisation or improve his/her vocal range ,  and also to increase confidence .

New faces are arriving all the time and in some cases actors make a quick start with a first job or they may have a relatively long wait before they get off the mark .

A distinguished philosopher ,  much admired in the profession ,  became a celebrity overnight when he wrote in a Sunday paper that what all the varied responses had in common was the forlorn belief that somehow ,  through talk or action ,  the decisive event would be warded off .

Without images , he said , there would not even be the wherewithal to <head>talk</head> about the death of images . Language itself ,  he said ,  would cease to function as it had always functioned ,  it would only be a strange dead thing ,  smouldering perhaps ,  but burnt out ,  no longer conveying any meaning .

These originated in Northern Italy ,  where the pasta is traditionally flat and where they use a lot more egg and cream in their cooking .  But if you put an egg tagliatelle with a heavy ragot ,  you lose all the benefits of the pasta .  Frozen and chilled pasta comes into its own when you are <head>talking</head> about filled pasta , especially individually quick - frozen products . Generally frozen pasta has whole egg in it ,  giving it a softer ,  smoother texture which goes well with cream and lighter tasting sauces .  Bray adds that frozen pasta with good quality fillings is especially useful to caterers because it can be made up quickly into either single -  or multi - portion dishes without waste .

There are some circumstances in which accounts of conscious experiences may be very useful in suggesting hypotheses about the nature of cognitive processes .  The still influential contribution of Khler and the other Gestalt  psychologists to elucidating the rules underlying pattern perception is a major example .  But when we <head>talk</head> about our conscious experiences we are providing our listener with only a very crude approximation to the actual phenomenal content of experience . ( Interestingly ,  one of the functions of art is the attempt to refine this process of communicating mental states and the accounts of the artist can sometimes be a more useful guide to the nature of cognitive processes than nave introspection .  )  What I am suggesting is that introspective reports ,  while often providing helpful qualitative information ,  can never be reliable enough to use as quantitative data defining the presence or absence of conscious awareness .

While we must support family rooms in those pubs which have the space and can provide suitable amusement for the little angels ,  this cannot remain the only answer to the problem .  Family rooms are useful to let the less well - behaved and noisier children run riot but they are frequently cold and characterless and ,  no matter how good the facilities may be ,  you often feel excluded from the main atmosphere of the pub .  I WOULD rather take my children into the main bar or lounge of a pub and expect them to sit sensibly and reasonably quietly so that we can all relax , drink , <head>talk</head> and eat in a proper pub atmosphere . What is needed is a relaxation of the law as it now stands to allow the controlled admission of children to certain pubs at certain times of day .  I am not proposing a free - for - all ,  but the admission of children to certain pubs on the application of the licensee and the approval of the local licensing bench .

He believed that Peter 's  reforms had disrupted society by creating a Western - type bourgeoisie and separating the educated class from the common people .

And so , as in Winter Notes , Dostoevsky is really <head>talking</head> about pochvennost , his own brand of romantic conservatism , half history , half dream . In Crime and Punishment  itself the Petrine reforms get the merest glancing reference ,  and only one ,  when Raskolnikov 's  friend Razumikhin speaks of us  ( compare the we of the Drunks  fragment )  as divorced from practical affairs of every sort for nearly two hundred years .

Hirsch has rejected this phrase as delusive and logically meaningless ,  and this rejection might itself be rejected as an instance of the rat - trap logic to which he is inclined ,  an improper attempt to define a subject in more rigorous terms than the subject requires .  Utterances about literature make sense ,  and are generally understood ,  within the form of life in which they are habitually made .  Nevertheless , long before Hirsch , C. S. Lewis wrote that many discussions about literature are discussions of a nonentity ; for Lewis , literature was about as non - specific a term as <head>talking</head> or utterance . It was what was said that was important .  If we look at what is located at present under the general heading of literature we find an extraordinary variety of texts ,  with only very tenuous family resemblances between them .

By dropping the novel and other kinds of drama ,  more time would be provided for the extensive reading of poetry which is so essential if one is to make sense of any one poem .  There might be regrets over giving up the novel ,  but after having been deeply interested in that form for many years  ( even to the extent of writing one )  and often teaching courses on the novel ,  I have come to the conclusion that the pedagogic difficulties involved are extreme .  Percy Lubbock , at the end of The Craft of Fiction , acknowledged that as soon as we have finished reading a novel we begin to forget it , and what is left to <head>talk</head> about is a vague cloud of fading impressions : the book vanishes as we lay hands on it . In the face of this central problem ,  the valuable work that has gone on in recent years in narratology ,  and other aspects of fictional form ,  is curiously difficult to apply in practice .  Teaching often involves looking in detail at particular passages ,  in the hope that the part will relate coherently to the whole ,  but the doctrine of the hermeneutic circle reminds us that we cannot understand the parts until we understand the whole  ( and vice versa )  .

The most demanding would be one I have previously raised :  namely ,  that though the successful encounter with a poem may result in a unique aesthetic experience ,  academic practice demands that it be turned into non - aesthetic discourse .  Furthermore ,  not everyone who is invited to respond to an admired poem will have any such experience .  And although <head>talking</head> about poems as poetry will imply an aesthetic reading rather than a culturalist or historical one , it must be acknowledged that there is inescapable culturalist and historical underpinning of the idea of a canon ; not all the poems to be read will have much aesthetic value . What one hopes for is for the student to remain open to the possibility of aesthetic experience ,  to accept and enjoy it when it occurs ,  but not to fake responses if it does not. Such a course would be primarily concerned with the formal ,  technical ,  and conventional aspects of poetry ,  considered both synchronically and diachronically ;  in a word ,  rhetoric .

If we read Ash - Wednesday through with Tate 's  commentary at our elbow ,  we see at any given point what he means :  he has a good ear ,  as we might expect from his own poems  ( which are however metrical ,  as Ash - Wednesday is n't )  .  And we may agree that what binds together the six parts of Ash - Wednesday is in large part something rhythmical .  It remains true that in Tate 's criticism and since ( for no advance has been made in this quarter ) rhythm and movement are wholly impressionistic you hear what the critic is <head>talking</head> about , or else you do n't . This is one area where modern criticism has notably failed .  To be sure ,  the vocabulary for defining such rhythmical effects is yet to seek ;  but should not critics apply themselves to seeking and finding that vocabulary ,  instead of pursuing semantic and allusive niceties ?

All other things which are done instead of <head>talking</head> are a waste of time , are being used as excuses to delay the whole process , and will bear no fruit whatsoever , except the killing which is going on every day I refuse to stand by and do nothing .

Mr Seiters said he was convinced a similar solution will be found for the 250 refugees in the embassy in Warsaw .  In a clear sign of the tension in East Berlin where ,  as in Bonn ,  crisis meetings were held yesterday ,  the East German leader ,  Erich Honecker ,  refused to have a telephone conversation with Helmut Kohl ,  the West German Chancellor .  The refusal to <head>talk</head> , believed to have been decided in a meeting of the Politburo , contributed to renewed speculation here that Mr Honecker may no longer be in full control . It was also noted that Wolfgang Vogel ,  the lawyer to whom Mr Honecker had given the task of solving the refugee problem ,  had had his mandate drastically cut back .  At the same time ,  there are reports that workers '  militias had been used to cordon off streets during the demonstration in Leipzig on Monday night when some 10,000 people marched through the streets chanting Gorby ,  Gorby and calling for the legalisation of the opposition group New Forum .

There are tons of leaflets for offenders ,  but nothing for the witness or the ordinary member of the public ,  says Ms Reeves .

But it does n't seem to be an acceptable idea that something like burglary or a street crime can cause quite severe emotional disturbance .

Victim Support 's  trained volunteers offer an immediate response when people are still in a state of shock ,  giving encouragement ,  support and information .  The organisation 's  original intention was to refer victims to another professional agency like social services ,  but that has proved impossible .

Words like these are something to hang onto when people ask Why is opera fashionable now ?
