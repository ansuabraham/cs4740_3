Santiago ,  Chile :  On a warm autumn evening in 1990 international rock star Sting dances on stage with a group of Chilean mothers and grandmothers of the disappeared .  The event ,  organized by the Chilean Section of Amnesty International ,  is entitled An Embrace of Hope .  Moscow , USSR : At the same time , 12,000 miles away , a delegation from Amnesty 's International Secretariat is making <head>plans</head> for a fledgling Moscow Group to participate in the Women in the Front Line campaign . To outsiders ,  the two events may seem little more than an international organization at work ,  but for Amnesty members these events are charged with significance .  The Cold War was at its height when Peter Benenson ,  the British lawyer ,  founded Amnesty ,  and three decades later it is hard to believe that the Moscow AI Group finally has permission to become part of Soviet life .

After the first two chapters ,  it discusses where and how to read art criticism .  While this first chapter has outlined what that criticism is ,  the next gives sketches of half a dozen critical types .

Sculptures in cities are a part of cultural history ,  and can be the symbols by which the cities are known or remembered .  Rome is distinguished by the statue on the Capitoline Hill of Marcus Aurelius ;  New York ,  even the United States ,  is symbolised by the Statue of Liberty ;  Copenhagen is remembered for its mermaid .  Also , the history of sculpture includes some account of the abortive <head>plans</head> for sculpture , just as the history of architecture is incomplete as a history of ideas without a knowledge of rejected proposals . Even though the same might be argued for painting ,  the technical obstacles to be overcome for painting are very much less than for sculpture .  Again ,  this is where sculpture is closely aligned to social and political history .

In The Periodic Table  he mentions a woman dear to my heart who was murdered at Auschwitz :  but the book on Auschwitz does not discuss his relationship with her .  In The Wrench  he creates the rigger Faussone ,  the practical man whose cranes girdle the world and who keeps returning ,  a little heavy - footed ,  to the house in Turin where two old aunts fuss over his welfare :  Faussone was spoken of as my alter ego ,  and the book has to struggle to accommodate him as a second person ,  available for interview by Levi .  These omissions and transpositions indicate that Levi could well have kept to himself any <head>plan</head> he may have formed to end his life . During the meeting with him a few months before his death which was recorded in an article published in the London Review  ,  Philip Roth found him as keen as mustard :  here was someone who listened ,  with the intent stillness of a chipmunk .

There appears to be no creative public vision which will help the survival of the pub or help ensure a healthy and varied pub stock .  History ,  indeed ,  tends to show that public intervention can have the effect of reinforcing rather than curbing market excesses .  It was the licensing system and licensing controls , after all , which helped to foster Britain 's peculiar brewery tie and concentrate pub ownership in the hands of the brewers in the first place ; and it was the same system which connived at and partly encouraged the modern contagion of open - <head>plan</head> pub designs . In addition ,  the 1989 MMC Report ,  conceived as an attack in the public interest on the monopoly power of the major brewers and requiring the untying of large chunks of their tied estates ,  may have devastating consequences for traditional pubs .  For despite their other shortcomings ,  most of the major brewers have been able and willing to cross - subsidise many less profitable houses .

At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .  In recent years serious damage to the historic interiors of pubs has resulted from the creation of the open - plan which now seem to be pubs '  standard internal layout .  Often the creation of the open <head>plan</head> interior requires the removal of walls , chimney breasts , stairs and other internal features of interest , which is highly destructive of the building 's historic character . The owner of The Hollybush at Elstree proposed to infill an original coach arch in the pub 's  facade and to demolish the timber framed side walls of the passageway behind in order to form a larger and open interior ,  even though it was this feature that distinguished the building as an historic inn .  In the most extreme cases the existing building is so different from the historic pub concept that a virtual rebuild is proposed .

A good example of this can be found in the sleep village of Buckland in Oxfordshire !  The Lamb ,  a picturesque village pub closed some years ago by Allied ,  was reopened in 1989 as a free house after an extensive remodelling  which involved the complete gutting of the original unexceptional but characterful ,  partitioned interior .  Now nothing remains whatsoever of the old fittings , features or proportions ; in their place is a vast , open - <head>plan</head> space with bright white walls , bistro furniture and cheery chintz . A similar treatment was recently meted out by Allied 's  Tetley Walker subsidiary to what remains a fundamentally Georgian pub in an urban setting near Manchester  the Church Inn at Lowton .  Having applied cement render over the external brickwork ,  attached a hideous modern porch and added an extension in jarring and inappropriate modern materials ,  the brewery designers have gutted the interior .

One such example is the Grade II Pen and Parchment on Bridgefoot in Stratford - upon - Avon ,  where the barn at the back of the pub was used as a theatre throughout the 18th century .  Such appropriately Stratfordian associations have ,  however ,  been totally disregarded by Whitbread in their recent cavalier remodelling of the complex .  Not only are the pub interiors themselves of the nondescript , open - <head>plan</head> kind , but the barn to the rear has been wholly mutilated . Fortunately ,  not all recent pub refurbishments have been in this vein .

The rich variety of pub types created during the 19th century has subsequently been largely lost by redevelopment and remodelling .  This not only makes an understanding of the nature of Victorian pubs difficult ,  but also means that those which do survive merit special care and attention .  One of the most important changes in pub design during this period was in the <head>plan</head> . Pre - Victorian pubs were largely run on the basis of waiter - service ,  following from the original concept that the pub was a house open to the public for refreshment  hence the term public house .  Thus the introduction of bar service was a revolution .

Thus the introduction of bar service was a revolution .  Bar service enabled various different rooms ,  or cabins within rooms ,  to be served from a central point ;  many late - Victorian pubs had a sequence of separate private bars serve from a single bar - counter ,  in total contrast to the current fashion for single - room pubs .  The modern desire for open - <head>plan</head> has led to the removal of many bar - partitions , destroying the character of original interiors and distorting any attempt to create a truly Victorian interior . The small private bars not only created intimate areas within a pub for small groups of people ,  but also enabled a wide variety of people to be served in the same building .  A 1907 description of a typical suburban pub with six bars featured omnibus drivers and conductors in the four - ale bar ,  horny handed sons of toil and lady customers in the bar opposite ,  with other woman in the bottle and jug .

The John Bull in Layerthorpe ,  York  ( B Wilson ,  1937 )  was a Tudor - style pub remarkable solely through having survived unaltered ,  but not listable simply on these grounds .  The needs of pub management in the 1980s have been hard to contain in pubs originally segregated into saloon and public bars ,  if not into further distinct spaces .   This has been the experience of the Thirties Society in fighting for the retention of the main <head>plan</head> features of the Nag 's Head , one of the few listed pubs of the period . Designed as a demonstration of bi - partite segregation between public and saloon ,  it lends itself poorly to unification ,  and the restorable public bar would have been lost in the process .  The Thirties Society negotiated a compromise scheme with the architects acting for Ind Coope which the owners found  unnacceptable  ,  threatening closure of the pub .

A more straightforward case is that concerning Jack Straw 's  Castle ,  which was listed after a scheme was submitted to cover the courtyard with a new restaurant .  The new emphasis was to be on dining rather than drinking ,  and the design was as sensitive as it could have been .  Due to the circumstances of the original build , there are some strange anomalies in the <head>plan</head> , but the courtyard remains a key part of the design , much enjoyed by visitors in the summer , sitting under a fine specimen walnut tree . The scheme was taken to Public Inquiry in October 1990 ,  in which the Borough of Camden was supported by the Thirties Society and Lucy Archer ,  Raymond Erith 's  daughter and biographer .

They had become my friends and there was no way that I would now go back to being their problem dependant .  I wandered back north towards the church .  My <head>plan</head> was to sit around and wait for one of the parish team to appear and then to ask them for their advice . Accordingly ,  when I arrived there ,  I settled down in a pew at the back and nodded off .  After a while ,  I was woken by the noise of preparations  something happening .

The calcareous clays ,  such as East Anglian boulder clay ,  are alkaline and therefore will not suit azaleas or rhododendrons .

Once planted ,  and whether 10 or 50ft high ,  a tree becomes a focal point around which to build a complete plant community .

By blanketing the soil they also help to control weeds .  Leguminous green manures ,  such as clover and beans ,  fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil by means of their root nodules ,  so making it available to plants later in the growing season .  Including the planting of a green manure into a garden <head>plan</head> can seem difficult . The easiest way to start is to sow small patches when clearing crops in autumn .  Of course ,  if for any reason you have to leave your garden for several months ,  the best thing you can do is to sow a suitable green manure .

Such incidents can only be avoided if the pilot has a more open mind about where he is going to land .  For example ,  if the glider is too low to land conventionally in the normal landing area directly into the wind ,  it may well be possible to land across wind and behind the normal launching point ,  so that the low turn can be completed safely .  All too often the pilot has a <head>plan</head> in his mind and sticks to it even when it should have become obvious that the situation has changed and his <head>plan</head> is no longer feasible . It is sometimes quite hard for a person to do the unconventional ,  but that may be the only safe option .  However ,  if the pilot is thinking ahead ,  that option could have already been considered and he could have had the plan ready for use if more height was lost .

It is in these situations that centring skills are most useful .  When giving instruction in thermal soaring ,  I try to insist that students go on attempting to find lift until about 5600 feet ,  and I very often explain my own thoughts and precautions as they do the flying .  All the time during each turn it is essential to have a <head>plan</head> for the worst contingency and to know exactly what you would do if you suddenly lost 200 feet . In this way it is possible to use the lift low down with safety ,  provided that the thermals are not too turbulent .  Then it is necessary to give up much higher .

HO Circular  ( 194/78 )  describing British and American research literature on policing is another typically apologetic ,  anti - intellectual document ,  for within its first few paragraphs it admits :  the implication of attempting to establish a central research information centre to give advice to chief officers about research findings ,  or collect ,  collate and distribute research of interest to the police service ,  and maintain an up - to - date index of research would be very considerable .  There are no <head>plans</head> to establish such a centre . No one seems to have asked whether the Staff College could have taken on this job ,  but then again such anti - intellectualism is apparent even in the Bramshill Scholars '  Association .  In 1985 ,  they proposed to extend their role beyond that of an annual dining club for officers who had taken a degree through the police college scheme .

He talks enthusiastically about getting back to some real police work in the real world ,  even though his responsibilities as Divisional Commander will be mainly administrative and give him little or no contact with the dangerous classes .  We take the piss out of him ,  because of this idea that he will be doing real police work ,  but we all know that divisional work has higher status for a Chief Supt. than Research ,  and this is the cause for celebration .  Within 3 days of his successor 's arrival , we have a Dept. meeting where our new Chief Superintendent outlines his <head>plans</head> . In a run down on the style of deference he anticipates  ( which I note will stifle any critical point from below decks )  ,  he talks about his length of tenure and how long it will be before he can escape back into the real world .  The research  manager  ( a civvy )  who is aware of my research interests grins across the room as this desire to escape back into real work is reinforced by yet another Chief Supt.

Professor Dudek had envisaged the series coming out in paper covers  ( the format that was just becoming the  way  to the mass market )  ;  Leonard ensured that it went into hard ;  Dudek had not meant the books to be prestigious in format but vehicles of introduction ;  Leonard saw to it that his book could stand alongside the best that there were from both sides of the Atlantic .  And he himself covered the entire costs  ( of 300 )  ,  and did most of the distribution and selling  ( on the campus ,  in the local cafs ,  in bookstores and so on ,  aided by a mini - advertising campaign in the McGill paper )  .

Associationism is long dead as a theory of thought ,  but externalism remains as a feature of most of its naturalistic successors ,  because ,  by virtue of their naturalism ,  they can find no space for intrinsic generality of mental contents .

The human mind which , from this viewpoint , is the brain is said to work on the same <head>plan</head> as a computer , with operations being carried out on physical symbols . The question is ,  what gives these symbols meaning ?  The answer is that ,  as with associationism ,  their meaning comes from their relations to things external to themselves .

The Anniversary Organising Committee had felt that a clock should be commissioned to replace the one which had been stolen ,  and perhaps because I have for some years specialised in the reproduction of historic clocks ,  my name was one of those considered .

Although several quite good photographs of the original clock existed these were in <head>plan</head> elevation only and there was no indication of the dimensions , particularly the depth . The photographs also indicated that the original had two trains  ( going and striking )  and indeed there were some interesting notes prepared by a Dr Byrom who was an enthusiastic amateur clock repairer ,  and who overhauled the clock in 1970 ,  but these were couched in very general terms .  At about the time the new clock was commissioned ,  I became seriously ill with a heart condition ,  and it proved not possible to undertake the extensive research required to faithfully replicate the old clock .

When you are laying out a new workshop you can play a particularly entertaining board game .  First you need a scale floor plan of your workshop drawn out on graph paper marking where all the doors and windows are ,  and ,  if they are already fixed ,  where all the electrical points and outlets are .  The next stage is to go to the manufacturers of the machines you thinking of installing and get the <head>plan</head> dimensions of their products . You then make little card templates of each machine in the same scale as your floor plan ,  then go and look for any other large objects that you might have to install  your bench area ,  your timber storage area and a storage area for board material .  You measure those up and make little templates to scale to represent them .

About 250,000 people live in residential homes ,  which are run by local authorities ,  charities or private companies .  These numbers have increased considerably over the past few years ,  partly because income support is available to help cover the fees of residential and nursing home care ,  and money to pay for care at home is not easily available .  At the time of writing , the Government 's <head>plans</head> are to change this system from April 1993 . Local authority social services departments will become responsible for assessing and arranging packages of care for people who need help .  Such people will ,  in most cases ,  be assessed for their ability to pay for services at home or in residential or nursing homes .

Had BR had more time and more funding ,  had the government been more sympathetic towards the railway investment and had there been no recession ,  the APT might have eventually been successful  but that is another story .  ( By 1988 the Italian Railways had produced a tilting train  the Pendolino  which  appears to be successful .  )  Not only was the non - fulfilment of the APT an enormous financial loss but since its rapid adoption in squadron service had been presumed there were no alternative <head>plans</head> for either trains or track . As the depression began to affect West Coast loadings it soon became clear that it was no longer possible to sustain the level of service provided in the 1974 Glasgow electric timetable .  The hourly off - peak service from Euston to Liverpool and Manchester was an early casualty when the service was cut back to a ninety - minute headway ,  but the most far - reaching change concerned the Anglo - Scottish services between Euston and Glasgow .

At one stage the average time of the five daytime trains between Euston and Glasgow was over five and a half hours .  However the long - term decline of the West Coast main line was not a prospect that InterCity was prepared to accept .  As a first stage towards reviving the route 's viability <head>plans</head> were made to accelerate certain key Glasgow services by raising the line speeds from 100 to 110mph ; the second stage was to prepare an investment case for new equipment to fill the gap which would otherwise have been covered by APT . Raising the maximum speed from 100 to 110mph was relatively easy .  While the fleet of Class 87 locomotives and Mk 3 stock was capable of 110mph ,  the only guards '  vans on the route were old Mk 1 cars restricted to 100mph .

To go with the new Class 90s an order was placed for twenty - nine Driving Van Trailers  ( DVTs )  to replace the old Mk 1 guards '  van .

Although no <head>plans</head> exist at present for 125mph train speeds , a more general extension of 110mph services is likely to start in 1990 . East Coast Main Line .

As already mentioned , many <head>plans</head> had to be changed in the light of the recession and these included reduction of the number of Cross Country HSTs .

Further growth in leisure travel  ( which represents 29 per cent of NSE income )  was planned to follow the introduction of the Network Card on 29 September providing one - third discounts on off - peak travel .  Chris Green announced that NSE had a commitment to quality improvements on all fronts ,  but with full - blooded business direction aimed at maximising the high profile of the sector ,  to which his famous red lamp posts gave an immediate impact .  Longer term financial and quality improvements were to follow major station redevelopment schemes , including profitproducing office and retail elements , of which the redevelopment of Liverpool Street and for which new <head>plans</head> were announced in 1986 is a good example . The redevelopment of Liverpool Street involved the closure of the much decayed ex - North London Railway terminus at Broad Street ,  and the diversion from 30 June of the remaining North London Line services to the City via the newly constructed Graham Road curve into Liverpool Street using dual - voltage Class 313 units .  In retrospect the most important event of 1986 may have been the conception of the new Networker train ,  filling a vital gap price and quality wise ,  at long last making it possible for NSE to plan systematic replacement of old EMUs .

The answer is yes ,  although the risk may only be minimal in the case of minor projects associated with dwelling houses .  Unlike the Full Plans method ,  the use of the Building Notice procedure does not entitle you to any documentary proof from your council that your proposal is satisfactory ,  or that the work will be accepted by the Buildings Control Officer who is required to inspect the work as it proceeds .

Ferranti then hopes to decide on a course of action and in particular on how to restructure its capital base .  It has already undertaken to sell off 100m worth of businesses and to raise 150m through a rights issue or by attracting a suitor .  Sir Derek said last night that he had glanced at the Hill Samuel <head>plan</head> and was interested to see how it works out . But he stressed :  It 's  only an idea ,  not a proposal ,  and it needs a lot more work .  The Hill Samuel plan envisages splitting off the UK naval and avionics businesses and giving shareholders one share in the new company for every share they hold in the existing organisation .

By PATRICIA WYNN DAVIES ,  Legal Correspondent BARRISTERS could retain much of their monopoly over advocacy in the higher courts under a subtle agenda for discussion spelled out by Lord Donaldson ,  the Master of the Rolls ,  as he opened the Bar 's  annual conference in London at the weekend .  Signalling the beginning of a lower - key campaign against the <head>plans</head> of the Lord Chancellor , Lord Mackay of Clashfern , to give increased rights of audience in the High and Crown court to solicitors , Lord Donaldson called on the Bar to put aside the trauma , the acrimony and the recriminations which followed Lord Mackay 's Green Papers and to abandon the hustings . Lord Donaldson said objectives due to be included in this autumn 's  Bill were total freedom of choice for the client ,  unless the interests of justice otherwise require .  When those concerned turn their attention to this problem ,  they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public interest in the result and that in which the public interest is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available .

AMP has had a business in the UK since 1908 .

AMP argues that its proposed acquisition of Pearl represents a significant step in its <head>plans</head> to become a major force in international life insurance markets . The Australian group said that Pearl 's  policyholders will benefit from the deal through its capacity to bring new products and marketing skills and expertise in administration ,  computing and product development .  If successful in acquiring the British group it intends to operate Pearl as a separate entity with its own sales force .

The astonished Briton ,  who recounts the event in this new autobiography ,  also recalls how his Nazi host remarked to him after the general had finished spouting :  I 'm sure it 's  not necessary to ask you not to pass any information on to the Communists .  Even the most myopic Teuton must have been able to see that the politely inquisitive Englishman being entrusted with these confidences had to be an Intelligence man.

While companies with factories in China show few signs of pulling out in a hurry ,  some have lost enthusiasm for further expansion .  A survey conducted by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce showed that 55 per cent of companies had postponed further investment decisions ,  while another 36 per cent were still debating what to do .  For example , Tomei Industrial ( Holdings ) , an electronics company with 95 per cent of its production in China , accelerated expansion <head>plans</head> in Malaysia and Thailand , and hopes to cut China - based output to about 50 per cent of total production . Another company ,  Gold Peak Industries  ( Holdings )  ,  which makes car audio equipment ,  is also trying to hedge future risks by setting up new factories elsewhere .  In both cases ,  the companies were worried less about producing the goods than selling them .

It was suggested Goldsmith interests already had two per cent and were planning to build a significant shareholding to encourage the Grand Met board to consider a breakup .  The stock market theory is that the Goldsmith contingent needs a new challenge now its bid for BAT Industries has effectively evaporated .  The Goldsmith <head>plan</head> to break up BAT has been overtaken by BAT 's decision to do the job itself . Sir James was first detected on the Grandmet share register earlier this year .

Mr Dromgoole said this would flatten ,  if not drop in the new year ,  as the group reins back its activities to minimise the amount of levy paid to the Government .

So far non - advertising revenue stands at 38 per cent of turnover and around 30 per cent of profits , though HTV does not have <head>plans</head> to make any large acquisitions , such as the purchase of CCA Galleries last year . CCA was in these figures for just three months and fine art contributed 849,000 of profits ,  up from 156,000 .  HTV is also redeveloping a 21 acre parcel of land close to its studios at Culverhouse Cross which could realise more than 5m of profit .

The real problem is that ,  unless resisted ,  the vigorous pressure for federalism by some leaders in Europe will become an assumed part of our involvement in the European Community .  We did not agree to this on accession in 1972 ,  nor again in 1975 in the Referendum ,  nor in the acceptance of the Single European Act in 1986 .  Mr Haselhurst claims that he is not aware of any preconceived <head>plan</head> but seems unaware that Michel Rocard , Prime Minister of France , describes himself as a complete federalist and of the recent advocacy by the five Christian Democrat leaders in Europe of a Single European Government and a Single European Parliament . That is what convinces me where they would like to take us .  This would inevitably imply the end of our Westminster Parliament in any real sense and the loss of our freedom to decide our political ,  economic and social priorities and ,  with it ,  the loss of our hard won democratic system .

The measure applies to the transport sector ,  to the fuel and energy industries ,  and to metallurgical and chemical enterprises .  Above all it is aimed at the country 's  railways ,  where disorganisation and disruption and not only in politically - inflamed Soviet Transcaucasia have caused dangerous shortfalls of coal and oil stocks at power stations ,  and of other raw materials at factories across the country .  The outcome was none the less a climbdown for the government , which was obliged to drop its original <head>plan</head> to outlaw strikes in all sectors of industry for 15 months , amid deep divisions among parliamentarians over the extent of the powers to be granted . Instead ,  the new provisions will operate only until passage of a draft law on strikes ,  which itself bans such industrial action where it would endanger lives and health .  This Bill ,  which sets out detailed mechanisms for settling disputes ,  could be passed early next week .

The closures are mainly smaller ,  less profitable branches or those with overlapping parishes :  150 full - time and 93 part - time staff will lose their jobs ,  some of them through voluntary redundancy and early retirement .

Mr Fitzwater added that Mr Bush has invited both the Polish President ,  Wojciech Jaruzelski ,  and Prime Minister ,  Tadeusz Mazowiescki ,  to meet him in Washington .  The decision to increase American aid reflected the dramatic changes in Poland over the past two months ,  said Mr Fitzwater .
