Academies of art ,  whether in the West or in the Orient ,  have had lists of priorities in themes of art ,  in which there are many similarities .  For example ,  in twelfth - century China ,  a catalogue of the Imperial collection had ten headings :  Taoist and Buddhist subjects ,  human affairs ,  palaces and other buildings ,  foreign tribes ,  dragons and fishes ,  landscapes ,  animals ,  flowers and birds ,  ink bamboos ,  and finally vegetables and fruit .

Commemorative figures in city squares ,  portrait busts ,  tomb or cemetery furniture have also been traditionally restricted by the terms of commissions .  A consequence of this tradition is that the sculptor 's  own personality may receive less prominence in a monograph than a painter 's  ,  as the effect of patronage given or withheld can be decisive in a sculptor 's  career .  The other major role of the sculptor is in the service of religion , where a high <head>degree</head> of interplay between artist and patron is not necessarily so important , making the sculptor 's situation into one which is more like the painter 's . Writing on Auguste Rodin can make the point .

Part of the reason for this is that the American professoriat is the largest in the world ,  while the American market for current art is unprecedented ;  it is evident that the turnover of the American art market as a whole is the largest in the world .  The persuasive tax advantages for the rich to contribute works of art to public collections also play a part ,  contributing a measure of prestige shared between artists and the powerful in society .  Critics can also be invested with a <head>degree</head> of respect deriving partly from their academic connections . Another sort of authority derives from money ,  which a reader of art criticism may find it difficult to dissociate from an object .  Historical knowledge is the surest cure for this damaged intellectual condition ,  as the history of taste will show many examples of the irrelevance of monetary value to artistic quality .

Catholic morality approves of the view that to repel an aggressor is to engage in a just war .

A dislike by Irish clerics for such an explicit and direct church  state relationship has a long tradition and comes out best in De Tocqueville 's   ( 1957 )  conversations with Irish clergy on his visit to Ireland in 1834 .  When asked if they would like subventions from the state to aid their stipends and church buildings ,  a move which was being seriously considered by the British government at the time ,  priests and bishops were united in rejecting the idea on the grounds that it would drive a wedge between clergy and people ,  identifying clergy with the principal enemies of the people .  De Tocqueville 's notes reveal not only the conscious opposition to such a mode of religious power but also how deep the solidarity between clergy and people was , the <head>degree</head> to which the poor , half the catholic population at the time , looked to the clergy for material and spiritual leadership , guidance , and assistance , and how much they trusted them . However ,  with the emergence of the Southern Irish state ,  it soon became clear that this secularization of the state form was not to signify an absence of Roman catholic power in the construction of public morality ,  but rather an indirect recognition of the sovereignty of the church in most areas of moral concern besides education .  In fact ,  precisely because Roman catholic power was to be accepted as normative in an entirely natural way by the catholic  nationalist population ,  the church 's  part - active and part - passive  acceptance of the capitalist system of government and thorough opposition to socialism had a significant legitimating function for the Irish state - form .

This monopoly position is therefore totally beyond criticism .  One might speculate that an impending solution to the Northern Ireland problem would split off from the clerical leadership those groups for whom the present position is only accepted on pragmatic grounds .  Hence the traditional alliance between catholicism and nationalism might be split at the popular basis with the ensuing growth of a <head>degree</head> of anti - clericalism . However ,  as the very existence of the catholic  nationalist alliance impedes progress towards such a solution ,  one should perhaps view such a possibility as unreal .  The Roman catholic leadership in Ireland has first to change and radically evaluate its monopoly beliefs ,  thus permitting the dissolution of one of the most antagonistic aspects of catholic  nationalist hegemony .

Some catholic nationalists in the South mix with a proportionally much larger number of Southern protestants who ,  however ,  are loyal to the Southern state .

The belief is to some <head>degree</head> affected by being told so by their authoritative pastors . It has even been described as a fundamental moral precept by more than one Irish catholic cleric :  The law of the Church is quite definite ,  quite universal in this matter .

The pressure to remodel old pubs is of course nothing new .  The Victorian and Edwardian eras witnessed many wholesale rebuildings of modest Georgian drinking - houses ;  during the Interwar period even more money was pumped into enlarging and rebuilding old pubs ,  as well as in creating large new ones  ( see Alan Powers '  essay below )  .  However , alterations were more often than not effected with some <head>degree</head> of sympathy for the existing fabric and atmosphere . With the advent of postwar Modernism much of this sympathy evaporated .

Both these establishments seem to have had an architectural form very similar to the ordinary domestic buildings of their area ,  and the hall provided the communal eating and drinking space .

The alehouse in its most basic form was simply a domestic building where ale was sold to generate additional income for the household ,  although David Lupton observed in 1632 that the alehouse keeper  defies a wine tavern as an upstart outlandish fellow ,  and suspects the wine to be poisoned .

It exists largely as a product of the institutions of higher education  ( Sarsby 1984 :  132 )  and has only recently begun to surface in policy and practice .  As Okely  ( 1987 :  67 )  observes ,  the urge to create publications is not always as crucial to others as it is to the academic .  Indeed for those insiders living in Cheater 's metaphorical front room such as in the police the need to obscure and seek a <head>degree</head> of anonymity from the analytic gaze can be described as a major principle in the preservation of power , ranking highly in the structures of significance . Yet there are those of us who ,  although firmly based inside such an institution ,  have undertaken anthropological training and have  subsequently developed the academic wish to be discursive .  Our interpretation of the field situation therefore becomes a specific and unusual type of anthropology at home ,  for it is not out there in the exotic or even in the backyard .

He must come to terms with living with this consciousness and with the inherent problems he will face in revealing this knowledge to the outside in an ethnographic account .  Moreover ,  he must come to terms with a new awareness of what he has previously accepted ,  perhaps without thinking ,  which under the intense microscope of social enquiry may well seem to verge on the ludicrous or to be morally indefensible .  And having long been supported by the institution he will be crucially aware that it expects a <head>degree</head> of loyalty verging on deference or acquiescence . In such an archetypal world ,  where good is constantly and insecurely balanced in an eternal struggle against evil ,  the  objective explication of the rituals and symbols which surround and mystify police work can seem tantamount to a treasonable act .  In 1979 ,  James Anderton ,  the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester ,  described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from seditionist interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy  ( Thompson 1979 :  380 )  .

It would be paradoxical for them to be in the vanguard of social change ,  for as Templeton  ( 1980 )  points out ,  they are there to preserve the structure ;  to uphold the state of play .  But there are a few who are  questioning the  state of play ,  and who agree with Ben Whitaker  ( 1979 :  312 )  when he urged that police thinking would profit if it more often came out of its shell and concerned itself with wider questions about the role of the police and human relations .  However , this is not always easy to achieve , as I found out when I first returned to work in 1977 after my <head>degree</head> course . In order to continue postgraduate studies I had applied for some financial assistance for part - time fees ,  under a scheme created by the Home Office and set up specifically in recognition of a lack of higher educational qualifications in the police service  ( HO Circular 29/74 )  .  This directive encourages officers to research and study in their own time and lists suitable subjects ,  which include public administration ,  management studies ,  economics ,  law ,  criminology ,  social sciences ,  youth work ,  English language and literature and relevant modern languages .

I had applied to continue full - time research following my <head>degree</head> course , but this had been turned down by my chief officers ; however , I had been told that assistance for part - time study would almost certainly be approved in view of the national policy of encouraging officers to extend their educational qualifications . I then found my application for financial assistance for part - time study had been rejected because anthropology is not on the approved list of subjects  ( in the Circular )   ( Memo from HQ 1977 )  .  Eventually I was able to convince my senior officers that anthropology was  one of the social sciences ,  perhaps only because I somewhat sardonically returned a memo which asked why ,  if anthropology is not approved ,  have I just been allowed to read the subject on a Bramshill Scholarship ,  on full pay and allowances ?

Even at the same time as it publicly commends higher education , seeking out the graduate entrant , spending large sums on publicity to this end , and funding access to <head>degree</head> courses on scholarships , it also holds to a central ethic of distrust of the academic . Whitaker  ( 1979 :  229 )  clearly understands the way this rejection of training and education operates within the service :  at present good recruits often have to be chased to Bramshill on the lengthy command courses ,  because chief constables are not anxious to spare able men ,  and officers themselves are reluctant to be separated from their families and homes ,  as well as having a fear that they might lose from being out of sight ,  out of mind for promotion .

Furthermore ,  such pressures are limited ,  thus creating a situation where there has been hardly any research on the police compared with the large output of critical scholarship on industry ,  commerce ,  the civil service ,  the health service and education what little direct research there has been on the police has scarcely begun to ask such fundamental questions as what is the police force and what is it doing .  This point ( Wojtas 1982 ) occurs in a description of a new research centre for Police Studies at Strathclyde University , which is to ask whether anyone is doing research on the police , what <head>degree</head> of co - operation they have met and to encourage research by the police themselves . Once again ,  however ,  defensiveness won the day and when the Strathclyde Centre circulated forces asking them to co - operate in the venture ,  a decision was taken to withhold co - operation and a circular went round to this effect ,  suggesting the existing Home Office funded PRSU  ( Police Research Services  Unit )  and the Home Office Research and Planning Unit were adequate for the needs of the service .  This latter unit  ( formerly the HO Research Unit )  does provide some research material for those who seek it out and its bulletin is a reference source to recent government funded research ,  which is largely concerned with operational systems and the tools of policing .

The conference was also told that as an alternative to the expense of sending officers to university ,  it was proposed to  direct  officers to research a particular problem and give them a short period to carry out intensive research .  The emphasis on directed research is mine and indicates the reduced potential for any ethnographic sedition ,  for which force would seek to direct officers to the critical analysis of its subcultural idiosyncrasies ?  Furthermore , such short periods of directed research can be shown favourably as a saving over any extended <head>degree</head> course in the budgets . The emphasis of this directed  ( or controlled ?  )  research ,  it was announced ,  is to be on pragmatic ,  problem - solving enquiries  ( i.e. policy - orientated research )  ,  which ,  it was explained ,  would be of cost - effective advantage to the force .  There seems to be little chance of any philosophical ,  unprogrammatic enquiry here which might be critical of the system ;  and no espionage from within !

It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force  police service which remains unresolved ,  on which I will say more later in relation to the role of women police officers .  The dark uniform we wore had a military cap with polished brim ,  and in our fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boots we presented an avenging image ,  clothed in the symbolic colour of death and darkness .  Black is a light absorbent , non - reflective colour and most suitable for controllers who operate with a <head>degree</head> of social anonymity , upholding the rule of law and the abstractions of the legal system . In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .  As Reiner  ( 1980 )  suggested ,  the riot gear in which the police are increasingly seen ,  with shields ,  visored helmets ,  knee - length boots ,  and flame - proof overalls ,  enhances their avenging appearance .

The detective on the other hand ,  immediately sets out to reduce these culturally created separations ,  for he needs to negotiate a statistical reality with the dirty prig opposition .  The real polis is programmed to maintain a conceptual purity by maintaining structural distance ,  while the detective ,  of necessity ,  is forced to reduce this to carry out his deal with the dirt .  By reducing the social space between the dichotomies of ordered law enforcers and uncontrolled prigs , the detective necessarily returns a <head>degree</head> of humanity to the prig which the uniform collar feeler is always structured to deny . The lowly polis ,  with little or no power in the system ,  deplores this situation and complains of its escalation ,  while the detectives moan about the incompetence of the uniform wollies who never get close enough to their prisoners to extract their own coughs or admissions and who fail to understand that the system largely depends on the ability of the department to manipulate a statistical norm in detected crimes .  Stead  ( 1980 :  305 )  ,  like Mervyn Jones  ( 1980 )  ,  has also pointed out how police organization attributes low status to beat work ,  and asks the service to reconsider the value of the patrol officer :

Leonard could be fastidious to the nth <head>degree</head> in completing his own work he has always said that he works one word at a time , and can spend months , even years , in adding finesse to it ; he is nevertheless dismissive of anything approaching scholarly exactitude , still more so pedantry .

To describe self - governed perceptual sequences ,  Kant gave the example of scanning the front elevation of a building ;  in doing which we  determine what we see and the order in which we see it  roof ,  front - door ,  top - left - hand window ,  and so forth .  Obviously ,  each kind of experience necessarily contains elements of the other. Thus , there is some <head>degree</head> of selfdetermination in the ship case because we are free to shut our eyes , to cross the river and see it move from right to left , free to jump into the water and watch it coming towards us , free to determine the speed with which it passes across our visual field by moving our eyes with or against its movement . In the house example ,  we can choose the order in which we see the parts of the building but we surely cannot see occluded portions ,  and we surely cannot look up to see a thatched roof  because that 's  the kind of roof we want to see  when the roof is tiled .  In fact ,  in every microsecond of perceptual experience there is a tension between the real as refractory ,  as something we cannot choose or will ,  and the subjective as chosen and willed .

Scientific measurements may correct ,  reform or at least question individual unaided observations but there cannot be a systematic ,  universal discrepancy .  The cash value of scientific observations in this context must therefore be based upon subjective experience and cannot be greater than the cash value of the  latter ;  for it is subjective experience that ,  ultimately ,  validates our objective scales of energy intensity .  We may use physical methods of measuring light intensity that are apparently independent of our subjective experience for instance photosensitive cells but these are accepted because they correlate to a greater or lesser <head>degree</head> , under normal circumstances , with subjective experiences of brightness . If there were simply no correlation whatsoever between the electrical output of a photo - electric cell and some other measure of light intensity directly or indirectly related to experience ,  it would not have been accepted as a way of measuring light intensity .  However indirectly related to sensory experience a laboratory quantification of a particular form of energy may be ,  in the end the rate of exchange between one form of energy and another  the way in which we compare the quantity of one with the quantity of another  -  reposes upon the gold standard of subjectivity .

Despite the immediate success of the new fleet of 125mph trains which brought new standards of safety and on - board comfort firstly on the Western Region services out of London  ( Paddington )  and then on the East Coast main line from London  ( King 's  Cross )  ,  so much of what had been gained in the late 1970s was lost as the economic recession started to bite .  The impact was twofold .  The sharp decline in business activity severely reduced the volume of full - fare first - class ticket sales while the increase in unemployment and interest rates curtailed to a drastic <head>degree</head> levels of disposable income available for leisure purposes such as optional standard - class rail journeys . This loss of optional travel was also exacerbated by the intensified competition from longdistance coaches following the liberalisation of route licensing in the 1980 Transport Act .  Given the choice in such circumstances ,  many of InterCity 's  customers on low or fixed incomes  in particular students and senior citizens  preferred the cheaper but slower coach option .

BR could not avoid passing its dramatically increased costs following the oil crisis on to its customers ,  especially London commuters ,  and as they reduced in number  ( demand falling at 1 per cent a year )  services ,  stock and facilities were reduced to match demand ,  inevitably causing poor morale .  Even the ever - ebullient Sir Peter Parker saw parts of the commuter system rattling into decline ,  and nobody was surprised when in 1979 the government referred the services to the Monopolies  Mergers Commission. The Commission 's report was perhaps the turning point , for while it paid respect to the management it found to be totally dedicated to the railway with a high <head>degree</head> of pride in the service which came before financial reward in importance , it made thought - provoking recommendations about management style and the need to set clearer financial objectives .

Not that the eighties were without their problems : quite apart from the industrial recession of the early years , which affected all Railfreight 's bulk traffics to some <head>degree</head> or other , there was the historic miners ' strike of 19845 , taking heavy toll of steel as well as coal carryings . Happily the coal traffic was revived to the point where pre - strike tonnages were exceeded ,  although the number of individual collieries served was vastly reduced .  The merry - go - round system which allows loading and discharge to take place while an entire train remains in motion has continued to form the mainstay of Railfreight Coal 's  operations ,  and it is difficult to imagine a more efficient alternative .

Bakhtin is unusual among literary critics in making the focus of his activity the novel rather than lyric poetry or drama .  In practice ,  binary oppositions are very liable to favour one term at the expense of the other ,  and there can be no doubt that Bakhtin preferred the dialogic to the monologic  ( a bias that is evident in everyday English ,  where to engage in dialogue is good ,  and to utter a monologue is rather bad )  .  This emphasis made the so - called monologic forms of literature problematical , and Lodge quotes from an interesting late essay by Bakhtin which seems to suggest that all literary discourse is to some <head>degree</head> dialogic . To remove the distinction completely would seem to undermine the insights that had given force to Bakhtin 's  earlier criticism .  Lodge suggests that this need not happen ,  if one sees the monologic and dialogic as dominant tendencies rather than mutually exclusive terms .

That shared culture has gone ,  though its traces have persisted for a long time ,  at least among those unworldly older academics who assume that students of English will have read the whole of Shakespeare in the sixth form ,  or that they can readily identify classical or biblical references .  The belated realization that these things are no longer so leads to the embittered and baffled reaction that they ought  to be so .  However , that is a declining reaction ; the experience of regularly interviewing would - be entrants to an English <head>degree</head> course soon induces a sense of realism . In the state of affairs that still obtained when I entered the profession in 1959 the grammar school teacher and the university teacher of English were not radically different kinds of person ;  indeed ,  contingent or accidental factors might have determined which career path was followed .  Since then there has been a marked divergence between school and university ;  students have become less well equipped ,  and academics ,  particularly young ones ,  have become more high - powered ,  ambitious ,  and professionalised .

In the 1980s ,  following on government cuts in finance ,  British universities have been engaged in a desperate scramble for overseas students and the more - or - less economic fees they are required to pay .  It is an undignified business ,  but survival demands it .  Higher <head>degrees</head> in English are an obvious target for foreign students who have been trained in the subject in their own country , and who wish to obtain a doctoral qualification in an anglophone university before themselves becoming teachers . The university welcomes them as a source of income ;  some students are funded  by their own governments to obtain a doctorate and enter public service .  There is ,  in one way ,  an admirable balance of supply and demand ,  and some applicants are good by any standards .

In such cases failure is even more painful than with a home student ,  and one has heard rumours of failed candidates having to return several years of fees to their government ,  and suffering even worse penalties .  The problems are not universal ,  one must emphasize .  Some students , particularly those from the Indian subcontinent who have been selected for Commonwealth Scholarships , are capable of performing very well at higher <head>degree</head> level , and then returning to an academic career in their own countries . When overseas students do present difficulties  and I am sure many academics will be familiar with distressing or scandalous cases  it is not because they are lacking in industry or intellectual ability .  Many of them would do perfectly well in disciplines which are less idiosyncratic than English and have a more obvious international currency ,  like linguistics or economics or marketing .

Many of them would do perfectly well in disciplines which are less idiosyncratic than English and have a more obvious international currency ,  like linguistics or economics or marketing .  But in this respect ,  at least ,  English in the English academy ,  as Leavis liked to emphasize ,  is not just another subject .  It expresses a mystique , is to a high <head>degree</head> culture - specific , can seem elusive , and is not easily reduced to the rules and agreed procedures of other disciplines . It is not just overseas graduate students who have problems .  We must all have known home undergraduates who have worked very hard on an English course ,  who may be ambitious to do well ,  and who still ,  to their intense disappointment ,  end up doing badly .

I like Graff 's  proposals ,  but they seem to me utopian .  They might work in the graduate school of a good American university ,  where a variety of methods already abounds .  I cannot see how they could be established in British literary education , where there are no graduate schools as such , and the narrow , uphill tunnel of A - level work leads on to the rocky , cloudy uplands of the undergraduate <head>degree</head> , with its confused mixture of practical criticism and thematic study , analysis and literary history , coverage and special subjects . Undergraduates of moderate ability do not much like being asked to choose between differing judgements on the same text ;  I can imagine them becoming confused and resentful if they were asked to choose between different critical approaches and all their attendant ideological baggage .  Certainly ,  I have known some undergraduates who would rise brilliantly to such a challenge ;  but they are an exception ,  and one cannot base a course on what would suit the exceptional student ,  much as one would like to .

There would be no fixed canon ,  and no coverage .  Such a degree course would not suit everyone ,  but it might well be attractive to the late entrants and mature students who are increasingly common participants in higher education ,  particularly in the humanities ,  and who bring valuable experience of life and work to their study ,  but may have rather little formal preparation .  It would also be more appropriate for the unambitious students of moderate talents who currently apply for an English <head>degree</head> , but would be more at home in a less intensive programme of liberal study . Cultural Studies would provide a more productive environment for the radical aca - English Departments ,  who have conspicuous energy and intelligence ,  but little literary sensibility or aesthetic interests .  Literature ,  when taught in such a context ,  would ,  no doubt ,  be given a culturalist and contextualist treatment ,  and I believe that there is nothing inherently objectionable about this .

The intention is that students of elaborate structures in language should be able to construct them as well as receive and consume them ,  if only to achieve a better understanding of how poems are made .  Something of the sort has already been introduced into some English <head>degrees</head> , under the aegis of the Verbal Arts Association , who have made a welcome start with such work . The reading of English poetry would be accompanied by a consideration of historical as well as current theories of poetry .

What I have proposed in the foregoing pages is a conscious surrender to the culturalists of much of the activity that now goes on in English <head>degrees</head> , in order to retain something more coherent , defensible , and inherently valuable . Culturalists will point out  as C. S. Lewis once did  that much poetry of the past was not written for aesthetic ends ,  but for religious ,   political ,  or other social purposes .  This is true ;  but such poems have outlived their original purposes and now survive as aesthetic entities .

But a restatement of that ancient affinity should strengthen poetry against political and culturalist claims .  The academic study of music may be a specialist field ,  but music ,  of every kind ,  is widely diffused and performed ;  only a small percentage of those attending concerts or recitals will have taken degrees in music .  Similarly , one would like to see a state of affairs in which many more people read and enjoyed poetry than had taken a <head>degree</head> in it . The degree in poetry I have outlined would attempt to be open about its theoretical assumptions .  I do not believe there is any absolute virtue in such openness ,  in fact ,  I think that education is ideally carried on in a shared form of life where there is agreement about fundamentals and attention can be concentrated on the task in hand .

In the 1950s ,  it seemed as if there might be a place for literature in the academy ,  so that the writing of fiction or poetry ,  of criticism ,  and the teaching of literature would become a unified form of life .

Thirty years on , English is a large and entrenched subject , and there is no likelihood of putting the clock back , and starting again in some other way : my proposal for a division between Cultural Studies and a <head>degree</head> in poetry is a pragmatic proposal for a way out of current difficulties . Other factors ,  like the institutional need to advance knowledge ,  to publish ,  to engage in research ,  and generate performanceindicators ,  would remain ,  whatever new academic structures emerged .

It does ,  however ,  have a missionary vision of what it means to be truly human ,  derived partly from rational reflection on human capacities and desires ,  but supremely from its conviction that we glimpse true humanity in the life ,  death and teaching of Jesus .

The page - turner wisely sat far back ,  following his own score .  Most of the pieces ,  certainly ,  needed all the dramatising they could get .

The political consequences are first increasing loss of control and crumbling of the party apparatus ,  next the state 's  need to fall back on the army and police to preserve its own existence ,  public order and ,  it claims ,  the chance of imposing painful economic reforms .  Martial law ,  capable of preserving order but not reversing economic decline ,  in turn yields to semi - pluralism as the principle of the party 's  monopoly of power is jettisoned to create a national consensus behind measures to salvage the country 's  economy .  Army rule and multi - party democracy are , to an almost equal <head>degree</head> , anathema to the Soviet party leadership , Mikhail Gorbachev included . Moreover the Politburo can argue both that political pluralism is no panacea for economic problems ,  and that it is much easier to apply in Poland than in the vast multi - ethnic Soviet empire .  In proposing a ban on strikes ,  the Soviet leadership therefore wished to nip the incipient labour movement in the bud .

But nor is it fair that with 6 or 7 per cent of the vote ,  the West German liberals should be the sole arbiters of who rules in Bonn .  The case for electoral reform is best discussed in terms of the question :  what kind of political system do we want ?  Our electoral system strongly favours two - party government ; other people 's systems , in varying <head>degree</head> proportionate , result in coalitions of a usually centrist tinge . The difference goes far deeper than the political complexion of the government .  The strong tendency of pluralistic systems of Europe is consensual and ,  in some cases ,  quasi - corporatist ;  on the other side of the coin ,  they enable extremist minorities to thrive .

The <head>degree</head> of craft , the <head>degree</head> of inspiration , are the measure whereby they can be valued ; through these are achieved , consciously or inadvertently , the heights and depths of spiritual expression whereby they are a joy for ever .

Primarily , however , an empirically based study of public order policing is impossible to undertake in the midst of the province 's continuing violent conflict , and certainly could not be done with the <head>degree</head> of depth , empirical focus , familiarity , and , frankly , personal safety which an ethnographic study of routine policing allows . Nor would such a study have been given permission by the RUC ,  for it is utopian to expect police authorities in divided societies to open up these sections of their force to scrutiny and observation by outsiders .  An analysis of routine policing at least allows the possibility of empirical research being undertaken on police forces operating in divided societies ,  which is itself important because studies in the sociology of policing focus almost exclusively on police forces in stable liberal democracies .

And ,  further ,  in areas like Easton ,  where there is very little crime related to the troubles ,  the police do not on the whole develop the attitude that law and order is a battle between the RUC and Catholics .  This encourages a balanced view of Catholics ,  something which ,  as we shall emphasize in later chapters ,  can be absent amongst some policemen beleaguered behind their reinforced stations in areas of high tension and conflict .  A final point worth making in defence of the data is that the observational material cannot be impugned to the same <head>degree</head> , because in the flow of action during an incident the exigencies of the situation usually take over , making it difficult for policemen and women to act in ways contrary to what the situation requires or their colleagues demand . Hence many extracts from the data used in this volume are near - verbatim records of natural conversations in reallife settings .  While on the whole we feel knowledge of the field - worker 's  religion was not detrimental to the research ,  we believe it also had positive effects ,  in that it immediately forced respondents to confront their attitudes towards Catholics ,  as did the field - worker 's  gender in relation to sex roles in the force ,  placing both issues high on the research agenda .

Being the observer in the Land Rover on patrol is unpopular because observers do the paperwork on incidents ;  those who cannot drive are thus left with a great deal of boring work .  It also affects the evaluations of incidents and what counts as a good turn .  Incidents are categorized by the <head>degree</head> of paperwork involved , and the best shifts are those where you 're kept busy but with stuff you can clear up on the spot ( FN 26/5/87 , p. 34 ) . Great pleasure is therefore taken when the buck is passed and the paperwork is handed to someone else .  And there were occasions when banter and humour were used by low - ranking officers to convey the impression to the section police  that they should go easy on the number of skulls  ( prisoners )  they accrued because of the excessive paperwork it was causing .

Television therefore helped make up the minds of those who were newly interested  in politics ,  or unusually interested  in politics ,  interested in the election campaign but not very interested in politics more generally .  Ratings of radio news were less predictable than ratings of television but they too were influenced by recent political interest , motivations for following the campaign , and <head>degree</head> of party preference .

The conceptual distinction between perceptions and attitudes is clear ;  but perceptions of party chances or the state of the economy imply an element of approval or disapproval when articulated by the electorate .

As the election approached ,  perceptions about party chances of victory became more homogeneous :  most voters thought Conservative chances were good and Alliance chances were poor .  Perceptions of Labour chances remained more predictable ,  though they too became rather more homogeneous as the campaign came to an end .

Overall television fulfilled its public service role of informing the electorate ,  and did so particularly well as the election drew closer ;  while the press fulfilled its self - assigned role as pamphleteers within a libertarian system ,  and did so with increasing effect as the election drew closer .

Indeed they must be pleased by the traces of evidence that suggest that bias in a freely chosen medium such as a newspaper is actually popular with the electorate rather than resented .

The concept of a national centre has been a hierarchical mental device used by historians since the Reformation to over - simplify the chaos of diverse local stimuli .  In primitive societies with small ,  self - sufficient units there was no differentiation between centre and periphery ,  and it could be argued that many peasants in Russia remained at  this level of perception during NEP .  Yet urban , industrial polarization had already developed to a considerable <head>degree</head> before 1917 , creating awareness of the political centre among the more sophisticated peasant strata such as village teachers , zemstvo clerks , bookkeepers , doctors ' and veterinarians ' assistants . E. D. Vinogradoff has shown how local agrarian social and economic conditions shaped the collective political behaviour of peasants elected to the Fourth State Duma .  This was clearly the case in the Central Agricultural Region ,  which we shall consider in Chapter 2 .

The partial compensation found in the fertility of the black and brown immigrants of the Commonwealth countries who had sent over 3 million people into Britain since 1962 did not meet with universal enthusiasm ,  as the evidence from the Race Relations Board frequently suggested .

Non - white Britons were having a growing impact , notably in mass sport and entertainment ; commercial advertisements to an increasing <head>degree</head> focused on a poly - ethnic consumer market . But only an enlightened few saw this as a symbol of national renewal .  In the face of this varied sense of internal malaise ,  the return of the Thatcher government ,  with its young - Turk generation of monetarists and entrepreneurs ,  marked at least a change of gear ,  even if the privatization of publicly - owned enterprises was a very minor feature of the Conservative manifesto in 1979 .

The real essence of Thatcherism ,  indeed ,  lay not so much in its ideas ,  which proved to be increasingly malleable as the years went by ,  and especially when Nigel Lawson took over the Treasury in  1984 .  It lay rather in the company it kept ,  the classes with which it was associated .  As noted , Mrs Thatcher came from a relatively humble , unprivileged background , though a <head>degree</head> at Oxford and later marriage to a millionaire businessman gave her a distinctly haut bourgeois status in time . But her outlook was subtly different ,  say from that of Edward Heath ,  whose father was a carpenter in a small town in Kent and who ,  like Mrs Thatcher ,  went to a local grammar school rather than the private boarding schools favoured by most Tory leaders .  The Heath background was one of constructive ,  but deferential ,  working - class Toryism .

Indeed ,  Fleet Street itself was a misnomer from 1985 onwards ,  as modern technology and high unit costs led major newspapers to move out of central London to the eastern inner suburbs ,  to avoid the unions '  stranglehold .  The long ,  sometimes violent ,  dispute with the print unions over the relocation of The Times  plant at Wapping marked a notable step both in the new financial and technological independence of the press and its ideological separateness from the union - corporate approach of the past .  The Church of England was also , to some <head>degree</head> , a victim of the Thatcherite attempt at hegemony . The Church had continued to lose members in the 1970s and 1980s ,  yet it remained a powerful source of social criticism .

For decades ,  as the Royal Commission on Wealth and Income demonstrated in the late 1970s ,  those disparities were modified by the social benefits available under the welfare state .  By the end of the 1980s ,  partly as a result of deliberate government action ,  more perhaps because the unduly optimistic assumptions of Beveridge and other founders of the British welfare system were being falsified by financial and cultural factors  ( such as the breakdown of the old nuclear family of fabled tradition )  ,  the welfare state was far less able to temper the asperities of a harsh and divided society .  The beleaguered ranks of social workers and investigators of the 1980s documented a society more unsettled , more helpless , and to some <head>degree</head> more violent than at any period since the century began . Finally ,  there was constant angst  about Britain 's  world role .  The direction of Britain 's  post - imperial policy was unclear after 1945 .

The distortions which occur under a system of all but exclusively local authority house - building  the tendency to conform to the past rather than the future location of population  ( with consequent immobilisation of labour )  ,  the wrong proportion of houses of different sizes ,  and the provision of more amenities than those for which tenants are prepared to pay the economic price  these will naturally correct themselves when private building is restored .  To combat the opposite extreme of jerry - building ,  we would make membership of the Housebuilders '  Registration Council 's  register compulsory upon all contractors for local authority houses ,  with a view to rendering the building industry eventually an industry subject throughout to publicly - approved standards .

Later ,  in December 1985 ,  the Archbishop of Canterbury 's  committee on the inner cities presented its report ,  Life in the City  .  This contained many proposals for the regeneration of these areas ,  including greater central government expenditure ,  which ran counter to the government 's  ideas .  The report was immediately dismissed as Marxist by a government spokesman and criticized with varying <head>degrees</head> of vigour by many Conservatives . These attacks in turn have been met by forceful rebuttals from Conservative back - benchers and from the Prime Minister herself .  The Tory critics object that the Church is peddling left - wing politics as a religious message ,  while failing to assert moral values .

Mrs Thatcher has been fortunate in that retirements of several senior personnel in the early 1980s gave her the opportunity to influence promotions ;  there were thirteen appointments as Permanent Secretary in 1982 alone and she has had a hand in appointing the great majority of Permanent and Assistant Permanent Secretaries since 1979 .  The traditional trade - off for the secure tenure of senior British civil servants has been that they are anonymous and politically impartial .  To some <head>degree</head> the impartiality has depended on there being a large measure of policy agreement and continuity between the parties in government . The doubts of some pre - war Labour leaders that the civil service would actually co - operate with a radical Labour government were largely laid to rest by the experience of the Attlee government .  But radicals in both parties who favoured radical changes ,  either to the left or to the right ,  have frequently condemned the civil service as the embodiment of an above - party consensus favouring continuity of policy .

They also embarked on an ambitious national scheme that was designed to place Britain at the forefront of the postwar civil aviation market .  British air travel before the war had largely been in the hands of two companies ,  British Airways for European services and Imperial Airways for services further afield .  Both functioned with a <head>degree</head> of official support , especially in the form of mail contracts , but proved themselves to be unprofitable in the face of subsidized foreign competition . In 1939 ,  after several years of study ,  the Conservative government attempted to reorganize the rather inefficient operation of the two airlines and to encourage more competition .  The result was a single national airline that was to be the so - called chosen instrument for British air services :  British Overseas Airways Corporation  ( BOAC )  .

The position was rectified only slowly ,  the USA taking on first part and then ,  by the end of 1947 ,  the whole of the burden .

In the 1910 general election the Conservatives main gains had been in the counties generally and the southern counties in particular .  The Land Campaign ,  or so it seemed to the Conservatives ,  threatened to wipe out those gains at a time when the party showed no signs of an electoral recovery elsewhere .  The Conservatives ' desperation to devise a counter - programme for the land , and the disagreements it provoked , demonstrate the <head>degree</head> of confusion which still existed in the Conservative ranks and the immense problems they still faced before the rampant omnibus of the Great War rescued them by running down their opponents . It is a pity that Fforde 's  determination to present the Conservative party as decided individualists prevented him from exploring the confusion in the Conservative ranks indicated by his evidence .  If disputes within the party over policy and doctrine were one symptom of Conservative confusion ,  another was the legion of leagues which appeared in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ,  when it seemed that hardly a year went by without the founding of some new right - wing association .

In concentrating all matrimonial legislation in a new secular High Court in London ,  the Act also represented the success of common and equity lawyers in capturing full control of matrimonial litigation .  To explain the nature of legal change Stone offers a model that suggests first ,  that clients revealed the gap between current values and the law ;  second ,  that this was followed by the attempt of lawyers and judges to narrow the gap ,  often by inventing legal fictions or effectively changing the law by judicial re - interpretation  ( the changing definition of legal cruelty provides one example of this )  ;  and third ,  that all this culminated eventually in legal change when the level of duplicity and hypocrisy became intolerable to law lords and legislators alike  ( pp. 1920 )  .  This model , which echoes that used by Oliver MacDonagh to explain the growth in nineteenth century government , relies on a high <head>degree</head> of consonance in the wishes of lawyers and their clients , a not unreasonable assumption given the limited access to divorce in Stone 's period . But it is not a model that holds up for the twentieth century ,  when liberalization of the divorce law was not a matter of last resort but was rather always proposed as a means of strengthening the institution of marriage  ( by permitting those living in sin to remarry )  ;  when opinion shifted with dramatic speed ,  for example between the conservative recommendations of the 1956 Royal Commission on Divorce and the endorsement of profound liberalization given a mere ten years later by both the Law Commission and the Church of England ;  and when the change in views of key institutions such as the Church of England were as important as those of lawyers .  The permission given by the 1969 Act for no - fault divorce was driven as much by a profound rethinking of the sources of morality by clerical and academic opinion as by the determined pursuit of individual self - interest on the part of either the population at large or lawyers in particular .

There have been some rather unrealistic valuations being put on businesses .

I think we will continue to have a <head>degree</head> of volatility in markets we 've not experienced previously and I think the way the market maker has to interpret his role now is such that we will never get the sort of fine tuning that the old jobbing system could provide . With so much more volatility in markets ,  it is perhaps inevitable that greater stress will be put on senior executives as they strive to adapt to ,  and cope with ,  ever faster changes .

This is true even though the ruling party  initially the Tanganyika African National Union  ( TANU )  and since 1972 the Chama Cha Mapunduzi  ( CCM )   has always accepted a system of primary elections to select parliamentary candidates .  In the four general elections held since independence the turnover of MPs has been as much as 50 per cent .  In contrast the authoritarian nature of Tanzanian politics can more usefully be measured by the number of political detainees which exceeded several hundred in the mid 1970s or in terms of the <head>degree</head> of pressure brought to bear on the rural population from 1974 to 1978 . It is also true at a more subtle level in that Nyerere ,  perhaps the finest political debater in Africa land responsible for the first translation of Shakespeare 's  Julius Caesar into kiSwahili )  ,  left himself with no - one to debate with ,  at least until he left the presidency to be party chairman in 1985 .  His survival over the years since independence in 1961 does not alter the fact that the discussion of real policy choices in a public manner has hardly ever occurred .

Consequently , relations between African countries and international companies were for twenty years characterized by a battle to take some <head>degree</head> of national control . Strategies for control have included the compulsory sale of 51 per cent of the share capital in the businesses nationalized by Tanzania 's  Arusha Declaration in 1967 ,  the compulsory sale of the majority of share capital by all large companies in Nigeria from 1974 to 1977 ,  and the creeping sale of 20 per cent of issued share capital in the Ivory Coast required from 1975 onwards  ( achieved by issuing new equity )  .  In Tanzania ,  Julius Nyerere commented ,  Our purpose was primarily a political purpose ;  it was an extension of the political control which the Tanzanian people secured in 1961 .

It was recognized that the integration of some kind of livestock farming with crops would ultimately be desirable .

This argument is partly valid in the African context :  Mutang'ang'i was periodically obliged to remove his metal cutting machines from his worksite in Nairobi .

By the late 1980s no African government could afford to neglect the significance of the sector for the employment of the hundreds of thousands of primary and secondary school leavers who were joining the labour market each year ,  and most were making policy statements which indicated some support for it .

He was later to become suspicious of Maine 's  motives ,  however ,  as he was to see in the glorification of contract a subtle justification of the legal institutions of capitalism ,  and he was to seen in Maine 's  insistence on the primacy of the monogamous family an attempt to prove that this institution was beyond historical change .  In the same year the Swiss scholar ,  J. J. Bachofen ,  published Das Mutterrecht  ,   ( Mother Right )  ,  a book showing that matriliny ,  the tracing of descent through women ,  and matriarchy ,  the dominance of women in society ,  as well as the cult of female goddesses ,  preceded the patriarchy and the patriliny we find in Biblical and Classical societies .  This idea was accepted with varying <head>degrees</head> of caution by many nineteenth - century anthropologists and ultimately was wholly endorsed by Engels , who , in the preface to the fourth edition of The Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State , gave warm praise to Bachofen . Bachofen and Maine were soon followed by J. F. McLennan ,  a Scotsman whose work in part coincided with that of Bachofen and Maine but which developed much more the study of kinship systems .  This focus on kinship had an influence on both Marx and Engels which culminated in their enthusiasm for Lewis Henry Morgan whose two principal books had a decisive effect on their later work .

If my heart was set on buying a Sierra XR4x4 ,  5000 for the Ritchie Motors offering would be sorely tempting .  The car was pretty sound in most respects  well used but not abused  and the existing faults would ,  the dealership assured me ,  be rectified before it found a new owner .  However , the lack of any service history is a major drawback when buying a six - year - old car with a greater than average <head>degree</head> of mechanical complexity . In the end ,  I would have to move on from this example to examine other XRs on offer around Glasgow .  But it would be possible that I might end up back at Ritchie Motors .

Even against the estate ,  the ride/handling/steering/braking package is by far the most convincing ,  as you would expect given SVE 's  involvement .

Certainly here is the only Escort variant with a <head>degree</head> of throttle steering available ; a responsive chassis . And this ,  along with a firm ,  well - damped ride and  hooray hooray !   properly shaped seats ,  means a driving experience of vastly different character from the others .  It 's  far from fast and there is some body shake over very rough roads .

Publicans were still the most important occupational group ,  holding between them almost a third  ( 31.2 per cent )  of all shares .  Perhaps a stake in a popular club would give profitable returns indirectly through the sale of drink .  The <head>degree</head> to which publicans invested for this reason in football is unknown but the pecuniary advantage at first sight seems doubtful . There was all the difference in the world between meeting a retired sporting hero behind the bar and meeting a shareholder or even a director .

Peter McIntosh ,  the co - author of this report and a pioneer in the historical study of sport in modern Britain ,  concludes that the state via the Sports Council should base both research and promotion on enjoyment rather than social function .  Commitment to sport has to be freely given ;  it has to be fun ;  it cannot be foisted on to the poor or the wayward from above because it is good for them .  This brings us back to a central theme of Sport and the British : the extraordinary <head>degree</head> to which it has been promoted privately without politicians , employers , or trade unionists taking a significant part except as enthusiastic individual sportsmen . People have created their own kinds of pleasure through sport and there has been no powerful institutional push of the kind that came ,  for example ,  from the French Church after 1905 or the German Social Democratic Party of the Wilhelmine era .  Britain even lagged behind the United States in the provision of industrial recreation facilities .

Many animals are diurnal  that is they are active in the daytime and inactive at night  whereas nocturnal creatures show the opposite orientation .

We are all aware to some <head>degree</head> of the daily rhythms of nature around us . Few people have not woken to the sounds of the dawn chorus nor seen moths drawn to artificial lights as daylight fades .

There are ,  however ,  some problems with this theory .  It is not clear how the duration of sleep could be controlled as regularly as is observed to be the case .  Even though it might be argued that a regular life - style implies a regular <head>degree</head> of fatigue and so will require a regular amount of sleep , in practice , such a <head>degree</head> of regularity is not achieved . Individuals go to bed later or earlier than average on certain occasions ,  as can be seen by close inspection of Fig. 2.2 .  For example ,  an individual might go to bed later than usual on one occasion because a piece of work or some leisure time activity took longer than normal .

for alertness  ( or fatigue )  the evidence must be based upon subjective measurements ,  but ,  for body temperature ,  objective measurements are possible .  It will have been noted that the rhythms of body temperature and alertness are timed very similarly with higher values in the daytime and lower values at night  ( compare figs 1.2 and 1.3 )  .  This means that a higher body temperature is associated with a higher <head>degree</head> of alertness or a smaller amount of fatigue . The detailed explanation of what makes us feel alert is not known ,  but it is certain to be some function of brain activity ,  and brain activity increases with body temperature .  This is because enzymes  ( proteins that are responsible for carrying out the chemical processes within the body )  act more quickly as the temperature is raised .

particularly for old people this ,  coupled with a tendency to have a weak bladder ,  can have distressing consequences .  A knowledge of the rhythms in urine formation can be important when treatment with drugs is concerned since they are removed from the body in the urine .  The <head>degree</head> of acidity of the urine shows a daily variation , nocturnal urine being most acidic . Many drugs are acidic or alkaline and this affects their removal in the urine ;  acidic drugs are excreted more easily in the daytime and alkaline ones at night .  Since drugs are costly ,  it might be desirable to give the drug when it is less readily removed by the kidneys .

There are two possible strategies for the treatment of an attack of dry rot .  The building owner may either employ a builder to carry out the work or opening up and eradication ,  or he may call in one of the numerous specialist firms to deal with the attack .  If a builder is entrusted with the work , it must be ensured through a full briefing and careful supervision that only conscientious , knowledgeable and skilled tradesmen are employed who are able to give rational advice on the proper nature and extent of the remedial treatment if the initial assessment of the <head>degree</head> of damage proves to be inaccurate . The advantage of employing a specialist firm is that its tradesmen are more likely to be well trained and experienced in this field of building preservation ,  with a thorough and successful job being a more certain result .  However ,  it should be clear that any firm which issues a guarantee must inevitably err on the side of over - zealousness ,  which will add to expense .

Cinema developed alongside the wireless and the telephone as communications media that would change the way people perceived the world around them .

They may have felt a <head>degree</head> of excitement as they turned their cameras on a train arriving at a station , waves crashing on the beach , or a group of workers emerging from their daily grind in the factory , but these early pieces of reportage were seen as nothing more than animated photographs , a further step in the development of photography . A little later ,  as filmmakers began to expend the medium 's  storytelling capacities ,  they drew from the techniques developed for the magic lantern or diorama and audiences saw a woman interrupting her husband in the act of kissing the maid ,  or a miller grappling with chimney sweeps in front of a windmill .  It was natural to see these moving pictures as nothing more than a novelty ,  perhaps merely a passing gimmick ;  they were ,  after all ,  only shown as an additional turn on the music - hall programme .

Its release had ,  however ,  been held up for some time on instructions from C. M. Woolf ,  a shrewd film salesman who had played a key role in financing the first projects of both Balcon and Wilcox .  The re - editing he demanded has generally been taken as evidence of just that Wardour Street backwardness to which Kine Weekly  alluded .  But while it 's true that Woolf 's disapproval of the film 's distinctive angles and extreme lighting contrasts does betray a <head>degree</head> of conservatism and , in his later campaign against The Man who Knew Too Much ( 1934 ) , he was clearly the enemy of anything even moderately original , Woolf was not a simple philistine . Brunel ,  no less committed than Hitchcock to an artistic direction for British films ,  was later unstinting in his praise of a man who by his faith and support set the pace at a time when we most needed it and credited him with contributing very considerably to the renaissance of the British film production industry .  Given that the re - editing of the film reduced the number of title cards from 300 to 80 ,  it is reasonable to assume that Woolf 's  intervention considerably improved the film ,  and that Woolf 's  commercial experience provided a valuable lesson both for Hitchcock and Balcon .

Mr Justice Simon Brown said he greatly preferred the approach adopted by Professor Jackson 's  tribunal .

In Shah 's case Lord Scarman said , All that is necessary is that the purpose of living where one does eg , for education , employment , health , family or merely love of the place has a sufficient <head>degree</head> of continuity to be properly described as settled . Why should an applicant ,  who must in any event be prepared to satisfy the primary purpose test ,  be worse off because he contemplates the possibility of a relatively short stay in the UK than one who had the fixed intention of permanent UK residence ?  It was logical to construe the phrase intending to settle in rule 41 differently from the contrasting phrase admitted for settlement which appears elsewhere .

SPANNING four continents and 70 countries ,  it is hardly surprising that the causes ,  and hence solutions to tropical forest destruction shift from region to region .  Common threads nonetheless emerge .  Tropical forests are almost always in developing countries suffering from varying <head>degrees</head> of poverty and debt . Economic pressures on forests are immense ,  placing them on the cutting - edge of the reconciliation between environment and development .  So ,  how do we save them ?

The main benefit is that I 've enjoyed it ;  that 's  my yardstick .

That political will does not exist because public opinion has not yet begun to be aware of the scale of possible changes that governments will ask their publics to accept .

Although the boto is a powerful animal ,  and can sometimes tear its way out of nets ,  more often it becomes entangled and drowns .

According to Best and da Silva , the <head>degree</head> of hostility from commercial fishermen towards the boto is unquestionably growing . In the past this has been countered by the numerous superstitions of the indigenous peoples towards the river dolphins ,  but as the economic pressures of the commercial fishery become greater ,  these superstitions are likely to become less respected ,  especially by the younger fishermen .  Development pressures in the Amazon basin ,  such as the construction of hydro - electric dams ,  deforestation ,  and commercial fishing ,  have brought a flood of new settlers to the area .

Moreover ,  there seems to be nothing artificial in principle in holding the acts of an employee done in the course of his employment as equivalent to the acts of the employer .  These principles ,  are ,  however ,  applied in different degrees in the respective spheres of Criminal and Civil Law .  A man is not punishable for a serious crime committed by another unless he has actually instigated the commission of a crime , and then he will be punishable though the crime committed may differ in some <head>degree</head> from that which he instigated . It may be noted that in Criminal Law anyone who aids ,  counsels ,  or procures the commission of an offence is liable to be tried and punished in the same way as if he were a principal offender .  But in the case of minor offences ,  and especially statutory offences ,  which are anti - social rather than immoral ,  a man may be punished even for the unauthorized act or default of one in his employment .

According to his professor ,  he was thorough and conscientious rather than brilliant ,  taking his studies very seriously since he wanted both to improve himself and gain a qualification for when he finished playing .  It was during his second year at Manchester that he was offered the West Indies captaincy for the visit by Pakistan ,  but decided that his studies had to come first ;  he had a strong sense of predestination and apparently felt that the leadership would be his eventually .  Completing his <head>degree</head> would ensure that he was better equipped to do the job , especially as by studying social anthropology he would be better able to understand his players . Yet had the visitors been England or Australia he may well not have been able to resist the  temptation ,  and this was only partly because they were the leading lights in world cricket ;  there was also the racial aspect ,  in that he passionately wanted to prove that a team of black players led by a black captain was the equal of ,  if not better than ,  the white teams .  No doubt it is difficult for young people now to appreciate the complexities and the rigidities of the social structure in colonial days.

As I left the railway station ,  the police warned me that there was a small demonstration against Norman Tebbit 's  recent industrial relations reforms .  That was the plan ,  but the morning 's  press was full of extravagant reports of the cuts I intended to make in health service manpower .  Fowler was inserted for Tebbit on the placards and the demonstration went ahead with a <head>degree</head> of intimidation that made the front page of every national newspaper the next day . It was not just street demonstrators who were assembled against us .  The nastiest little attack we endured at this time came from ,  of all papers ,  the Lancet .

I opened the conference to the press and the large room was packed .  When I spoke I made it clear that I intended to do something about the position of the early leavers and that I thought it right that people should not suffer if they transferred their pension from one job to another .  Some of the industry recognized that change was due and with various <head>degrees</head> of enthusiasm were prepared to go along with such proposals . What ,  however ,  caused almost universal consternation was my suggestion that we should go a stage further and see whether it was possible to introduce portable pensions  pensions which you could take from one job to another .  The industry was horrified .

Yet he had never been further from his native village than the horse and carriage festival forty miles away ,  where he competed every year .  After all ,  Bach never set a foot outside Germany ,  but he has the universe in his music .  The difference is in kind , but not in <head>degree</head> . Having drawn a blank with the local councils ,  and having been used instead of helped by nearby conservationists ,  Jane now wrote dozens of letters to banks ,  charities ,  environmental societies ,  corporations ,  official bodies ,  in search of sponsorship ,  or even a loan .  But there was no money in conservation as far as the business people were concerned and the charities and voluntary bodies were well - meaning but lacked resources .

Many are bronze mirrors with a normal tin content of approximately 10 per cent ,  which have been tinned to produce a silvery reflecting surface .  The second type has no separately applied coating ;  instead the whole mirror is cast in a high - tin bronze alloy containing about 25 per cent tin .  This alloy is naturally silvery in colour and is much more hard - wearing than a thin layer of tinning , but it requires a high <head>degree</head> of skill to control the casting conditions . The two types of mirror look much the same after being  buried for centuries ,  but when the microstructure is examined at high magnification ,  as in Figures 5.15e and f ,  it is possible to distinguish between tinned bronze and the high - tin alloy .

The former will cling rigidly to formulae regardless of the situation ,  nit - picking over tiny detail but sometimes unwittingly missing the larger issues .  The pragmatist is more flexible ,  recognising that exceptions do arise and must be practically catered for .  Both attitudes have a valuable role to play when considering an issue such as how to computerise a major corpus of information which exists in a variety of document types of varying <head>degrees</head> of complexity and intelligibility . The British Museum has a sound history in the field of documentation ,  even if our predecessors were on occasions less rigorous in their practices than are current staff .  In 1756 the Museum was compiling records of its acquisitions in bound ledgers called The Book of Presents and in 1836 the then single Department of Antiquities began to complete bound Acquisition Registers of a type still in use today  ( fig. 10.1 )  .
