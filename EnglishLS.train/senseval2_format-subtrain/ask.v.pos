Three - quarters of the AIDS problem is in London and much of the rest in Scottish cities .

Since 6th April 1990 ,  married couples have been taxed independently ,  and each spouse is responsible for paying tax on his/her own income .

Either you should <head>ask</head> your spouse to enter into the covenant or you could enter into a Joint Deed of Covenant signed by both you and your spouse . In either event your spouse should actually make the covenant payments ,  not you .  In the same way ,  if your spouse pays income tax at the higher rate and you pay tax at only the  ( lower )  basic rate ,  then in order to obtain Higher Rate Tax Relief ,  your spouse should enter into the covenant ,  or into a Joint Deed of Covenant with you ,  and he/she should actually make the covenant payments .

Accusations continue of security force involvement in covert assassinations .

The police had been <head>asked</head> by the organizers of the vigil to provide protection after an incident earlier in the evening when about 200 suspicious - looking men appeared outside the house where the vigil was being held . According to those at the vigil ,  the police only checked on the hose twice before the massacre occurred at 4am .  The apparent failure of the police to act promptly and effectively ,  including their failure to apprehend a large group of armed men under conditions of curfew in the township creates the suspicion that police were colluding with the attackers .

As there is no provision in the UK immigration rules for issuing visas to asylum seekers overseas ,  in an embassy or High Commission ,  there is a contradiction in the requirement of visas for asylum seekers to enter the country .  It is to be regretted that many of the Government 's  measures relating to its asylum policy introduced in the past few years ,  have been to discourage new arrivals .  Amnesty International has <head>asked</head> the Government on many occasions to lift those measures which place obstacles in the path of asylum seekers attempting to gain access to the refugee - determination process . In November 1990 ,  the Government conceded that the Immigration  ( Carriers Liability )  Act and associated visa requirements do indeed prevent some asylum seekers from coming to the UK ,  but further stated that it has no obligation to encourage or assist would - be asylum seekers to come here and enter our procedures .  We hope that in line with our recommendations ,  the Government will amend its procedures which obstruct the access to the refugee - determination process of those escaping from violations of their basic human rights .

Amnesty groups '  work responded to the challenge with new techniques such as networks focusing on abuses in specific areas of the world and campaigns on whole countries or themes .  For example ,  a Murder by Governments Campaign in October 1983 resulted in funeral marches with black coffins ,  drumbeats ,  and candles in Diss ,  Norwich ,  Bognor Regis ,  and London .  How to find the money necessary to carry out Amnesty 's work has always been a worry , and from the very beginning the Section Office <head>asked</head> groups for help in this area . However ,  in the first few years groups did not appear to consider fundraising a priority .

Attempting to capture the spirit of a period is another planning strategy for a survey ,  though this philosophical notion of a Zeitgeist  is notoriously elusive .  It is perhaps more the stuff of epigrams than analysis .  The idea that there is such a thing as the spirit of a time can be awkwardly challenged by <head>asking</head> , Whose time ? No prizes can be offered for pointing out that at a given moment there are artists of several generations working and in very different ways .  A further ,  and rather extreme way of dealing with a chronological survey of art is to eliminate the artists .

At no time will this be more true than in the 1990s ,  when the art critic confronts an increasingly international community of art .  Of course ,  surveys will continue to be written about American painting or German art ,  British sculpture or Australian print - making ;  this fact of publication does not mean that these activities have an inner coherence .  Any reader is entitled to <head>ask</head> what purpose such national anthologies serve ; their best justification is making art more accessible , enabling those living artists represented to find and hold on to audiences for their work . The reader can beware of an element of self - interest in such anthologies ,  whether in the form of books or exhibitions .  For one thing ,  a government agency may have commercial or political aims in commissioning surveys or anthologies .

Another consequence of the labelling of Impressionism and other groups by critics was that some artists naturally decided that they themselves could do the same job better than the critics .  In Western art there  had been artistic programmes and manifestos before Impressionism ,  but in the twentieth century they proliferated .  Part of the critic 's task in the nineteenth century , as now , was to interpret art for the lay public ; but what , artists <head>asked</head> themselves , if we interpreted our own work ? from such a thought sprang statements of artistic aims and manifestos , some using the new device of naming a group with a progressive title , such as futurism . De Stijl is an especially bold assertion of identity ,  the Dutch word for style implying that there is no other style worth considering .  The reader in this situation has a choice :  the work in an exhibition can be measured against the artists '  manifesto ;  or the critic 's  interpretation and assessment can be used .

This could be said with some emphasis of Chatterton ,  but not of Eliot himself ,  who moreover survived ,  who grew to be famous ,  who did not kill himself ,  though he was to wonder how one might set about dying .  Chatterton died the romantic and traditional early death of the divided ,  the invaded man ,  while Eliot did not. It is n't that Ackroyd <head>asks</head> us to compare these two poor Toms , in pursuit of a theory alleging the importance of imitation . But they are brought together ,  in successive books ,  by the force of this preoccupation ,  and the reader has to make what he can of the resemblance between two figures quite remote from one another in any coarser understanding of the matter ,  to do this while adjusting his sight to a vista of copycats ,  impostors and successive interpretations  a vista which is far from unfamiliar now and can be caught ,  for instance ,  in the productions and reproductions of contemporary literary theory .  Imposture is shown in Ackroyd 's  novel ,  in this burlesque of the literary life ,  to be an interesting business ,  but it is unlikely to cause Chatterton 's  reputation to inch back towards what it was in the retrospects of the Romantic period .

We are told that these last four words are Rimbaud 's  and the Surrealist Andr Breton 's  ,  and that in 1968 they were a slogan of the protesting Sorbonne students .  They are words that can be made to mean different things ,  and are applicable as such to the story of Jaromil 's  poetic progress from private to public ,  which can also be recognised as a simultaneity of the two ,  based on an enduring self - engrossment .  Kundera <head>asks</head> us to join together two things that are often kept apart : lyrical effusions and public poetry . The quoted words point back to the privileged second existence which poetry had once promised Jaromil ,  and they point ahead :  the old meaning has been reversed ,  with the claim that real life resides in a revolutionary solidarity .  Just before this snarl about real life ,  he has betrayed his redhead to the police ,  by swallowing a lying excuse of hers concerning a subversive brother .

Undoubtedly one of the best ways the overseas student has of seeing what is required in British theatre training is to apply for one of the summer schools offered by the drama schools ,  and find out what it 's  all about before committing him -  or herself to a long and expensive stay .  It 's  important that a student is prepared to understand and work with the prevalent theatrical traditions in UK schools .  And with so much theatre training available in the United States , New Zealand , Australia and Canada , it is interesting to <head>ask</head> why British theatre training is thought to be so beneficial . I can only put it down to the strong classical emphasis which prevails in the courses offered in the UK ,  although many of the university drama courses in the USA do stage Shakespeare and the European classical authors .  America has had many unsuccessful attempts to form a national repertory theatre ,  performing the classics of the English language ,  and one wonders whether it will ever be possible to get this going effectively .

On obtaining a prospectus and asking for an application form ,  you will find that every drama school will require an audition fee ,  and this can vary between 15 and 25 .  If you can afford to ,  it 's  generally best to spread your auditions around the drama schools so that you are seen more than once .  When auditioning for most schools you will be <head>asked</head> to present at least two contrasting speeches and possibly give some idea of your attitude to improvisation and , perhaps , to singing . It 's  usual to make a choice from the classical and modern repertoire .  Some schools will stipulate a number of Shakespearean speeches from which you may select ,  but in the main the choice of work is left entirely to you .

No drama school panel is looking for the ultimate in audition technique but candidates  should possess a noticeable degree of competence and self - awareness .  Not all auditions have just two speeches ,  classical and modern .  You may well be <head>asked</head> to sing something unaccompanied , or do a short improvisation and you may well be <head>asked</head> to perform one of the speeches in a different way . In some schools you will be asked to participate with other students in basic class work over a weekend  ( as happens at the Bristol Old Vic drama school )  and in some you may find yourself being judged partly by senior students of the school who will be sitting with the faculty panel  ( which is something that happens at Drama Centre )  .  The point of preparation is to be well tuned and at the same time flexible to new interpretations and ideas .

The new student does not perform to audiences immediately ,  and the first term 's  production project will probably only be attended by staff teaching voice ,  movement and acting to enable individual assessments to be made on training .  Improvisation There have been many books written about improvisation and if I were <head>asked</head> to choose just one it would be Keith Johnston 's Impro which is straightforward , understandable , and theatrically aware . Nowadays ,  nearly every young person has probably had some experience of basic improvisation at their school or through the extensive TIE  ( Theatre in Education )  tours .  In drama schools ,  improvisation is about finding a way of expanding the imagination and liberating the senses ,  which can get too confined if students work entirely from a text all the time .

What an impro of this kind does is confront the actors with a situation where they have to be emotionally truthful .  Without a text to assist them they may prevaricate too long before facing the brutal truth .  Improvisation can mean having the guts to experience anything which is <head>asked</head> of you . Can you truthfully become a child again ?  Improvisation should not ,  in any way ,  be confused with the rather  general idea of making things up as you go along ,  which has no real purpose beyond that of entertainment .

Drama school productions are staged with an awareness of the kind of demands the profession will make ,  and students are naturally anxious to be seen in the final production by people who 're likely to offer them work .  Unfortunately ,  it is often difficult to get agents to attend these productions .  Most drama schools final productions are staged over a similar sort of schedule , which means agents are <head>asked</head> to see students ' work over a fairly compressed period . Agents are notified of performances by the schools ,  and they also receive hundreds of letters from students inviting them to see particular performances .  Remember ,  though ,  that badgering agents is quite useless ;  if they want to come they will come ,  but telephoning them and overselling yourself can be just as useless as not letting them know that you 're alive and working .

We will see that this mode of constructing monopoly catholicism is alien to the Concordat period of Roman catholic church  state relations recognizable in arrangements ,  for example ,  with Spain ,  Portugal ,  and Italy .  A dislike by Irish clerics for such an explicit and direct church  state relationship has a long tradition and comes out best in De Tocqueville 's   ( 1957 )  conversations with Irish clergy on his visit to Ireland in 1834 .  When <head>asked</head> if they would like subventions from the state to aid their stipends and church buildings , a move which was being seriously considered by the British government at the time , priests and bishops were united in rejecting the idea on the grounds that it would drive a wedge between clergy and people , identifying clergy with the principal enemies of the people . De Tocqueville 's  notes reveal not only the conscious opposition to such a mode of religious power but also how deep the solidarity between clergy and people was ,  the degree to which the poor ,  half the catholic population at the time ,  looked to the clergy for material and spiritual leadership ,  guidance ,  and assistance ,  and how much they trusted them .  However ,  with the emergence of the Southern Irish state ,  it soon became clear that this secularization of the state form was not to signify an absence of Roman catholic power in the construction of public morality ,  but rather an indirect recognition of the sovereignty of the church in most areas of moral concern besides education .

But we must have the right to carry out our duty to impart the moral convictions ,  the moral teaching of our Church to our own members .

After arriving in office as Taoiseach for a second time in 1983 ,  he proceeded to collect opinions on such issues from various quarters .  From the Roman catholic hierarchy ,  he solicited the response that the church believed in the indissolubility of marriage .  Further , the Catholic Church does not <head>ask</head> that the law should enshrine any particular provision because it accords with Church teaching . The statement then went on to oppose the introduction of divorce on the grounds of the protection of the common good by the state .  In taking this position ,  the bishops were also following the lead of Pope John Paul II who ,  on his visit to Ireland in 1979 had argued :  Divorce ,  for whatever reason it is introduced ,  inevitably becomes easier and easier to obtain and it gradually comes to be accepted as a normal part of life  ( 1979 )  .

It <head>asked</head> the participants to stop haggling in public and permitted each bishop to take a decision either way for his own diocese ( Murphy 1959 ) . It is noteworthy that at this time  ( when secularised education was patronised by nearly all the governments of Europe including those that were nominally Catholic )  this query was dealt with as a matter of discipline by the Congregation of propaganda ,  and not as a matter of doctrine by the Congregation of the Inquisition .

Where interiors have survived ,  it has been through benign neglect .

How successful a computer installation is will depend largely on how clearly the customer and the supplier have defined ,  at the outset ,  what the system is supposed to achieve .

Some of these programs belong to the Shareware scheme which means that they can be used and evaluated for a few weeks ,  and you pay the registration fee only if you continue to use them .

If you have large amounts of data to back - up  ( more than will fit on the six diskettes )  ,  consider installing a tape streamer .

The British Standards Institute  ( BSI )  specifies a thickness of 30 microns for hotel use .  It is doubtful anything less than 20 microns of thickness would withstand the sustained use cutlery receives in the catering industry .  Price recommends all caterers to not only determine the micron thickness when looking at silver - plated cutlery , but also to <head>ask</head> for this to be specified on the invoice . Since topping up ,  rather than full replacement ,  is the favoured option for caterers ,  the first worry is matching up.

There are surprisingly few popular patterns of cutlery  most caterers use the historic patterns devised in Sheffield .  The fact that a wide number of manufacturers work to the same pattern means that the caterer who is topping up need not return to the same source for the top - up. Identify a selection of cutlery distributors , send them one of your pieces of cutlery and <head>ask</head> them to match it and send their sample and yours back . There will be some differences ,  but they may be too slight to be noticed by the customers ,  who would normally see only one piece of each item in any case .  Shopping around for a top - up will allow the best price while still keeping the cutlery service in the same style .

The main bulb planting season is upon us once again .  Shops and garden centres are fully stocked with row upon row of tempting treasures to add to our gardens .  Spring - flowering bulbs are difficult for any kind of gardener to resist since , unless they are <head>asked</head> to grow in appalling soil conditions , success if usually guaranteed . As well as the more familiar tall - growing daffodils and tulips ,  there are many dwarf - growing bulbs to choose from .  Their diminutive size makes them suitable for even the smallest ,  most overcrowded garden .

Even on low ground ,  the risk of frost is certainly with us from September onwards ,  and preparations must be made to take in half - hardy plants .  At Beechgrove we have a well - established standard fuchsia ,  Dollar Princess ,  with cerise sepals and a deep purple corolla ,  but Bill has done well in training a few new standards this summer and intends to give them early protection this year .  A gentleman from Peebles called our phone - in to <head>ask</head> for help with whitefly on his fuchsias , and Carole was able to offer some advice . Not only must you spray regularly ,  but it 's  a good idea to vary the brand of spray that you use ;  the nasty wee beasties soon develop resistance if you use the same one over and over again ,  and that 's  something worth taking the time to avoid .

The most common cause of serious accidents on wire launches is making a snap decision to turn off for a 360 turn without ensuring that there is enough speed .  Even though the nose has been lowered well below the horizon ,  a glider takes time to regain speed ,  and any attempt to turn off immediately results in a potential stall and spin accident .  The first question you <head>ask</head> yourself is can I get down straight ahead ? If the answer is no ,  then check the speed before starting to turn .  Reacting too slowly and taking too long to make a decision can also be hazardous .

One slip may mean that the wingtip is dropped ,  causing some very expensive damage to the wing or the fuselage structure and fittings .  It is rarely an impossibility to find a third person ,  and in gusty weather this must make sense .  Think how often you see two people struggling to rig or de - rig because they are too embarrassed or independent to <head>ask</head> someone to help . In the early days of gliding ,  trestles were not considered essential as an aid to rigging ;  I remember the very first ASW17 to arrive in the UK being rigged without them .  Like most new machines ,  everything was a tight fit and by the  time we had the glider rigged ,  we had worn out several people with the sheer weight of the wings .

Cockpit checks There was a time when many gliding instructors scorned the use of a rigid drill ,  and taught their students instead to check everything logically by going round the cockpit from left to right .  The disadvantage of this method is easily demonstrated by <head>asking</head> the students as they finish if they are sure that they have not forgotten something . They will then start all over again and go round the cockpit a second or even a third time .  This can easily be avoided if a simple ,  systematic check is followed .

The pilot released the cable but could not keep the glider straight ,  or stop in time to prevent the collision .  The Nimbus was undamaged but the K8 had one wing severed at about half - span as well as other serious damage .  Realising that the take - off would involve an element of risk , the Nimbus pilot had , in fact , refused to go at first , and had <head>asked</head> for the K8 to be moved . After it had been moved a short distance away ,  the pilot was persuaded that the situation was all right and he accepted this ,  rather than face being unpopular for causing further delay .  The accident caused considerable consternation and it became clear ,  talking to the members present at the launch point ,  that many pilots did not really understand all the factors which caused the accident .

In this position it will not leave the ground until a little more speed is gained .  The control movements needed to achieve this vary according to the configuration of the undercarriage .  Thus the pilots who are flying several different types of glider , or a glider which is unfamiliar to them , must <head>ask</head> themselves before each flight , Do I need the stick forward to lift the tail , or back a little to lift the nose ? With gliders which have a front wheel or main skid ,  a main wheel just behind the c.g .  and a tail - wheel or skid like the K13 ,  Grob 103 ,  ASK21 ,  Puchazc ,  Schweitzer 233 and most of the older single seaters ,  it may be necessary to ease back a little during the take - off run to raise the front wheel or skid .  A few seconds later as the aircraft gains more speed ,  it will need more forward movement to prevent it from unsticking with the tail - wheel or skid touching the ground ,  and climbing away too steeply .

I remember an American pilot with about 200 hours ,  a twin - engine Commercial and full Instrument Rating who visited us some years ago. On his site check our instructor found he was severely affected by reduced g ,  although he had about 60 hours '  solo gliding .  When he was <head>asked</head> to do a stall , he became panic - stricken as the glider stalled , and it was obviously unsafe to allow him to go solo . He stayed the week and was given lots of extra training ,  but he was still unsafe when he returned to the USA .  Although it may not have been related ,  within a month he had crashed on a bad weather approach ,  killing himself and his friend .

Instructors should test every student before allowing them to go solo to make quite sure that they are not seriously affected by reduced g .  This does not mean pitching violently to get weightlessness or negative g .  The student can be <head>asked</head> to pitch nose - down gently from level flight and from diving and climbing attitudes . Most pilots who are sensitive find themselves incapable of doing this exercise and their reactions are obvious .  In such instances they would need more training until an unexpected sensation does not cause a bad reaction .

Statistically these deaths largely occur as a result of the inhalation of vomit and alcoholic poisoning ,  and it therefore seems somewhat bizarre for the police to be in charge of those suffering in such a way .

At the 1987 annual ACPO conference , chief officers complained they were still having to deal with this illness and <head>asked</head> why do people still need to die in cells from inhalation of vomit ? In Chapter 3 I will describe in detail the culture created to deal with these street - visible offenders in a cell - block situation ,  but suggest the inertia surrounding the whole problem is more easily understood when we consider the social history of such illness  ( Foucault 1967 )  ,  and see how the executive has always allocated the control of such drunken dossers to the police .  As social dirt they become an affront to purity and possess the danger of the contagious and impure  ( Douglas 1966 )  ,  requiring their removal from the public vision .

The creation of this order at the time a new Official Secrets Bill was being pushed through Parliament by an increasingly interventionist government is significant ,  and the idea of a senior officer 's  having first read of any essay to maintain the integrity of the institution manifests the importance of the legalized surveillance of allegedly dangerous material and enhances the separation of the world of control from that academic enquiry ;  although its implementation is only randomly applied .  Just as Sgt Wilson 's  thesis was channelled to me because I was known to be interested in research ,  so many police research departments now get allocated the task of reading the essays submitted by sergeants and inspectors for NEBS or DMS qualifications .  In 1988 a visiting colleague from the Royal Ulster Constabulary <head>asked</head> if it was part of my role in Systems Development Department to comment on such essays . He told of his own difficulties in finding time to read all the variable essays submitted and knew of many that were never sent in at all .  For although Force Orders inevitably direct that such material will be submitted for assessment ,  it is typical that in a task - orientated institution which gives low priority or credence to the academic tome ,  the systems to ensure submission of the essays ,  or the ability to make much use of any useful ideas they contain ,  often remains sketchy .

Silence continues to sustain the hegemony ,  and social change only occurs when irresistible and more powerful forces are brought to bear from outside  ( see Adams 1988 )  .  Furthermore ,  such pressures are limited ,  thus creating a situation where there has been hardly any research on the police compared with the large output of critical scholarship on industry , commerce , the civil service , the health service and education what little direct research there has been on the police has scarcely begun to <head>ask</head> such fundamental questions as what is the police force and what is it doing . This point  ( Wojtas 1982 )  occurs in a description of a new research centre for Police Studies at Strathclyde University ,  which is to ask whether anyone is doing research on the police ,  what degree of co - operation they have met and to encourage research by the police themselves .  Once again ,  however ,  defensiveness won the day and when the Strathclyde Centre circulated forces asking them to co - operate in the venture ,  a decision was taken to withhold co - operation and a circular went round to this effect ,  suggesting the existing Home Office funded PRSU  ( Police Research Services  Unit )  and the Home Office Research and Planning Unit were adequate for the needs of the service .

This latter unit  ( formerly the HO Research Unit )  does provide some research material for those who seek it out and its bulletin is a reference source to recent government funded research ,  which is largely concerned with operational systems and the tools of policing .

to my senior command and in 1986 I informed my chief officers of the acceptance of my Ph.D .  thesis ,  in accordance with the directive laid down by Force Orders .  No one , of course , has <head>asked</head> to read it , for if my argument is correct the service has no need of any reminder of how the ideology works or how to implement the paradigms which support their cultural norms . Nor do they need their daily practice to be exposed to the analytic eye of anthropological thick description ,  for in their task - driven world there is little to be gained by reflecting on what they already live and understand .  Any need to analyse the ways in which the multi - variant police world forms a coherent and self - sustaining whole is material for the social scientist and not the practitioners ,  for they already live the system as a matter of course .

The result is that the war against crime fought by detectives becomes a symbolic re - enactment of conflicts in the economic world at large ,  between those who have material property and power and those who labour and are dispossessed .  Whether there is any social morality or justice in such a system is not a matter which the detectives are given to question ;  nor do  they spend much time in reflecting on why some dubious property acquisition is outside their terms of reference ,  or what the relationship is of such practices to the maintenance of position and power .  In the main , they are instilled with the pragmatic games of pursuit they play with the local petty thief ; and if <head>asked</head> to consider the wider nature of their role , they tend to fall back on protestations of political neutrality . This is another skewed reality ,  of course ,  for in their pursuit of the prig they are merely following a version of justice which depends on blind acquiescence to establishment values of honesty .  Leach  ( 1977 )  has shown the ephemerality which lies in any attempt to classify deviance on a global scale ;  for what is criminal in one society or at one point in time is relative to that time and place and to who holds the discourse on power .

To conclude this section it is necessary to point out a few things about the squad training sessions .  Firstly ,  karateka are not allowed to bring their own coaches  with them to training sessions because experience has shown that the presence of other coaches breaks up the training atmosphere ,  and causes people to separate to far corners instead of remaining together .  The second point is that you may be <head>asked</head> to take a drug test at any squad session . If you refuse ,  you will be treated as though you had failed the test ,  and you will face a lifetime ban .  Thirdly ,  the coach is in the business of picking winners ,  not his friends ,  so if you have n't been selected ,  you have to admit to yourself that perhaps you did n't deserve to be .

The sky never seemed to wake up and about the middle of the day it darkened .  More flakes sifted down like meal ,  sifted and sifted ,  drifting in at the embrasure and lying on the flagstones ,  unmelting .  When Jamie came in with the food at gloaming , Cameron <head>asked</head> him for another blanket . Naaa ,  Jamie said on a coyly taunting note ,  naaa ,  I winna .  He went out ,  slamming the door .

He and James should have broached it early on ,  devised sanctions  ( the withholding of rents ;  the blocking of highways and sieging of the big houses )  ,  called for practical suggestions from among the crowds  all that tradesmen 's  and farmers '  skill and nous and energy ,  coalesced for a moment into a great ball of force ,  then left to collapse under its own weight ,  to crumble again into its thousands of separated grains

Let it carry him along for a bit longer .  Where was James ?  He would <head>ask</head> Jamie in the evening . But Jamie was replaced that night by a tall ,  white - faced man who said nothing when he handed in the plate of food .  When Cameron spoke to him ,  he pointed to his ears and shook his head .

These were now more eagerly undertaken ,  and soon completed ;  thanks not least to the good offices of his very able assistant ,  Kelley Lynch ,  and his unofficial archivist ,  Robert Bower .   A few days later ,  after we had established ourselves in Montreal ,  we called him. Mr Cohen ? we <head>asked</head> in response to the Hello at the other end of the telephone . Yes came the unmistakable ,  deep - voiced reply .  We reintroduced ourselves .

His home was ever open ,  a centre of wisdom and influence for decades ;  admired even by cabinet ministers from Britain .  Among many high - level tasks ,  he drafted an Appeal to the League of Nations on minority rights ,  and made many approaches to various government authorities through a wide range of memoranda ,  petitions and similar appeals .  He was <head>asked</head> to stand for parliament , but declined , having no particular relish for party - politics ; he was too large - hearted a man for that . For all his organisational and business efficiency ,  he was a man of immense personal charm and dignity :  Well - dressed ,  aristocratic ,  calm ,  and with a ready and reassuring smile ,  it was said .  Moreover he was a man of great devotion ,  who upheld the high ideals of the synagogue 's   pulpit ,  the beauty of its services ,  as well as the splendour of the building itself .

And thou shalt write them upon the door - posts of thy house ,  and upon thy gates In so doing ,  from his earliest possible moments ,  Leonard Cohen became a witness in testifying to the unity of God  ( his oneness )  and his creation .  His deeper and more influential education was thereby commenced , based on the key concept of oneness , which would be intensified by the traditional recitations and questionings the eldest son <head>asks</head> of his father at Passover and the other festivals , and by his presence from an early age in the synagogue . ( The Cohens '  place was very prominent there ,  in deference to their priestly status and local influence .  )  Here he was allowed to take part in the processions ,  kiss the mantle girding the Torah scrolls ;  and sip the wine of sanctification  ( the Kiddish  )  on Friday evenings .

So these beginning years focused on reality  the underbelly of creation as well as its brightness  which was of immense importance to the making of the man and his mind .  In them opposing forces sought to violate his commitment :  the physical versus the spiritual ;  the free versus the regimented ;  the religious versus the secular ;  and so on .  He repeatedly found himself <head>asking</head> the question Who ? and What ? was he ? Believer or agnostic ?  Saint or Sinner ?

He prized too highly the Judaic emphasis of the wholeness of man 's  nature  oneness  his enjoyment of the gift of sexuality ;  and he criticised  at least e silencio   the false views that dichotomised and castrated man. We should not forget that it was not that long since Samuel Butler had published  ( in 1878 )  his famous poem A Psalm Of Montreal which was evoked by finding that Canadian philistinism ,  had removed a Greek statue of Discobolus to a side - room in the Natural History Museum ,  presently used by a taxidermist ,  because of its vulgarity .  On being <head>asked</head> what constituted such vulgarity , it was explained that it was because it had neither vest nor pants to cover his lower limbs ! Lazarus Cohen would have laughed at that ;  Butler simply vented his spleen psalmically ,  whose chorus was ,  starkly ,  O God !  O Montreal !

Here he could live in virtually complete seclusion ,  at a fraction of the cost it would take in northern Europe or Canada ;  where the people were unconcerned as to who you were or what you did ;  and where breathtaking vistas opened up for the seeing  both external and internal .  Here Leonard discovered the Greek way of life  its alternating rhythms of work and leisure ,  both on the seasonal and the daily basis ,  which are so conducive to creative thought and achievement .  Here he was able to stand back from the onrush of western man and <head>ask</head> himself the real questions of life and meaning ; get his young life , full and successful as it had been , into perspective . Here he began to crystallise the wisdom of some of his best poetry ,  writing and songs ;  for it was here that he was reborn ,  where he truly began to find himself ;  where ,  not least ,  the music of Greece entered his soul ,  evoking earlier memories and melodies ,  combining with them to suggest a new style ,  a new mystique .  ( Filled with wonder at the sound of the bazouki ,  as Jacques Vassal commented ;  also emphasising Leonard 's  appreciation of Theodorakis 's  then emerging art .  )

Sometimes she ran  through the rare rain or to feel the wind on her face .  It was a just over a week since she had first set foot on the Dorset coast path .  Each night she spoke to a waiter to order a meal ; each morning she <head>asked</head> for boiled rather than scrambled eggs for breakfast . Otherwise she could not remember when she had last spoken to anyone .  There  was only the sun ,  the seaweed ,  the feel of pebbles ,  sand or shingle under her feet and a night asleep in a hotel room .

Possibly he also washed his face ,  she did not know ,  never having asked him. Until bedtime ,  no further kiss would be offered in which ,  had it been ,  she might ,  or might not ,  have detected the scent of soap .  How about your day ? she <head>asked</head> , over dinner . Trouble with the trains again .  All very well them claiming these improvements to commuter lines .
