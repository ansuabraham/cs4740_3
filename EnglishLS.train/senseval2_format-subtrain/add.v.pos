ACET Director ,  Dr Patrick Dixon ,  recently told the National Symposium on Teenage Sexuality at Swanwick .  The conference was attended by 300 church youth leaders and school workers from across the UK .  Dr Dixon said , With up to 20 years from infection to illness , we just have to ask how many of our congregation have been <head>added</head> during that time ? Three - quarters of the AIDS problem is in London and much of the rest in Scottish cities .  Churches in these areas particularly need to be informed ,  involved in community care and supporting Christian workers seeking to prevent new HIV infection in schools .

It is in this more informal context that his draft for a sixteenth and ironical discourse should be read .

There was a time when it must have seemed to many of them that he would never receive a bad review ,  or even a cross word .  His first book ,  If this is a man  ,  about his months in Auschwitz ,  and its sequel ,  The Truce  ,  were hard to fault ,  and the successive publications of his middle age have been greeted by an admiration responsive both to his skills as a writer and to his character as a man.i In October 1985 ,  however ,  the chauvinistic American Jewish magazine Commentary  did succeed in performing the outlandish act of disparaging Levi and his books .

But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed ,  with clergy being left behind in some areas ,  the clerics remain the true cognoscenti  in religious matters ,  and are expected to be so by the laity .  This has always <head>added</head> to the clergy 's spiritual authority and status , and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals , with the high clergy deciding what constitutes matters of faith and morals . The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life .  The clergy were and still are in a special position ,  holding power over the laity because of it .

Despite Buckley 's  reluctance to play up the siege of Derry as a key myth and his preference for general categories of interpretation derived from various historical experiences ,  it does seem that the siege has particular significance .  Those who still seek compromise with catholic nationalists today are still known to the erudite leadership of the DUP as Lundies .  One should <head>add</head> that Buckley takes the Christian myth for granted , as backdrop to the discourse . But one must remember that the divergent reading of the Christian myth by Reformation and Counter - Reformation is at the heart of the religious as opposed to the rough interpretation of the conflict .  The importance of the protestant variant should not be underestimated given the extent of religious practice and the power of religious men within the protestant  loyalist bloc and the grave importance of conceiving of one 's  position as absolutely irreproachable ,  depending as it does on a divine source .

The wort is then cooled and run into fermenting tanks where yeast is <head>added</head> or pitched . Yeast is made up of millions of tiny fungus cells which literally go berserk when confronted by a liquid rich with sugars .  Within a few hours a scum appears on top of the wort and this rapidly builds up into a great yellowy - brown crust as the yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide .

The remaining yeast continues to turn the residual sugars into alcohol and also helps to purge the beer of the rough after - tastes created by fermentation .  Some brewers add extra sugar at this stage to encourage the continuing fermentation .  Caramel is sometimes <head>added</head> to give darker colouring to the finished beer . Finings ,  a glutinous substance made from the bladder of the sturgeon ,  is added either at the conditioning stage or when the beer is in cask to fine or clear the beer .

Instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to <head>add</head> a full , mature palate , keg beers are killed off in the brewery by a number of unnatural processes that affect the taste and quality of the product . The aim is to produce beers quickly which ,  because they are sterile and have a long shelf life ,  are also highly profitable .

It seems most surprising that the breweries consider the large open space to be the pub 's  ideal internal form ,  or believe the artificial ,  standardised historic pub interior to be preferable to genuine historic detail ,  when the original internal divisions and features are essential elements of the historic character that customers expect when entering such a building .   The Duke 's  Arms at Presteigne in Powys provides the perfect illustration of how the misguided quest for the ideal traditional pub character can seriously threaten genuine historic features .  This pub was originally a 17th century timber frame jettied building ; in the early 19th century its front was removed and a new rendered facade <head>added</head> . Although the loss of the original front is regrettable ,  the present facade is in accord with the general architectural character of the street and retains original late - Georgian features ,  such as its sashes with glazing bars .  The pub 's  owner ,  however ,  wished to remove the 19th century facade and undertake a conjectural restoration of the jetted ,  timber framed front  ( the design of which included various historically inaccurate details )  .

But he said it could mean duties of managers/owners  such as keeping a hotel plan or ensuring staff are trained to use the fire fighting equipment  implicit in UK laws  would have to be spelt out .

PUBLIC COMPLAINT WAS UNFAIR EVERYONE is entitled to their opinion ,  and while I agree with Joe Hyam 's  concerning service charges  (  Caterer  ,  1521 August )  ,  I feel he is taking unfair advantage of his position to have a go at people who do not do things the Joe Hyam way .  If the restaurant in question <head>adds</head> a service charge , then that is between it and the customer . Complaining in print about one restaurant 's  service charge policy  giving both the restaurant and proprietor 's  name  could cost that establishment a great deal of money in bad publicity .  Mr Hyam can choose not to pay the service charge or pay it under duress ,  stating so ,  but to complain like this in a magazine read by thousands is unfair and childish .

Judging by the number of trailer accidents on the motorways ,  it may be wiser to keep off them whenever possible .  Factors which influence the stability of the combination include the softness of the car and the trailer 's  suspension ,  plus the balance of the trailer .  It is a good idea to <head>add</head> an extra 5 or 10 p.s.i . to the pressure in the car tyres and to keep the trailer tyres at a higher pressure than might at first seem necessary .  If you are building a trailer ,  fit a suspension rated for a trailer heavier than the actual weight .

This can be allowed for by the winch or car driver reducing the power slightly .  However ,  this increase in speed must not be relied on if the launch is too slow and the pilot wants more speed ,  because the cause of a slow launch may be the beginning of a power failure ,  in which case steepening up in the hope of creating more speed would be dangerous .  During a winch launch the potential load on the glider is at a maximum near the top of the launch , when the pull of the cable <head>adds</head> directly to the weight of the glider . Excessive speed at this time can be dangerous in rough air if the pilot is pulling back hard .  The take - off

This kind of accident is relatively common with inexperienced pilots ,  especially when they are flying in competitions .  The final glide back to the base airfield at the end of the day is a particularly stressful time .  Usually it is at the end of a long day 's racing , with a number of stressful periods all <head>adding</head> to the pilot 's fatigue . Perhaps the glider is theoretically just within range for a straight glide home ,  but has very little extra height in hand and not much prospect of getting another climb .  At 1,000 feet the pilot may be some distance from his base when some extra height is lost because of strong sink .

The city is divided geographically from mainland Canada .  But the geographical differences pale when they are compared to the deep  threefold divisions which rend the city itself :  of language   ( four - fifths of the population speak French ,  only one fifth English and the smaller languages )  ;  of culture   ( the French - speaking part naturally looks to France and French literature for its mores ,  while the English - speaking part relies on the attachment to the Commonwealth and its close neighbour ,  the United States of America )  ;  and of religion   ( for the gulfs here are wider than the Atlantic as the former protestant cross - sectioning of Episcopalianism/Presbyterianism meets the Roman Catholicism of the French ,  and both meet the surging secularism and agnosticism of our day )  .  To all this is <head>added</head> ( and it must be emphasised that Catholicism has always been in the ascendancy ) , a healthy input from the Jewish fraternity whose civic and educational emphasis greatly increases the town 's well - being , albeit from a proportionately tiny community . ( Professor Dudek has demonstrated that from a base of only 1.7 per cent of the population ,  the input in terms of literature and art amounts to a staggering 25 per cent .  )  Montreal is an unusual city ,  made up of 50 villages which have grown and merged together over the years to form the modern conurbation :  about 100 square kilometres in size  ( 60 square miles )  ,  encircled by the St. Lawrence River .

Mythological or not ,  it has to be emphasised that he was speaking here of a group of poets  Ellenborgen ,  Hine ,  Mandel ,  Purdy ,  Macpherson ,  Layton and Cohen  not just Leonard himself .  But he clearly places Leonard within this group which ,  he held ,  grasps at a confusion of symbolic images ,  often a ragbag of classical mythology ,  in the effort to organise a chaos too large for them to deal with in the light of reason ,  which in turn causes them to express a sardonic bitterness in their social criticism ,  a realism without any utopian idealism to support it .  Not only sardonic bitterness , we must <head>add</head> but delicate irony , too . Leonard 's  mind was such that he always had several ironies in his fire at any one time ,  even when he was seeking to demythologise some of them !

Scobie is surely right when ,  with regard to Let Us Compare Mythologies  he says that the title seems to indicate that Cohen himself regarded the religious sense as the primary one  which in The Spice - Box Of Earth  becomes completely explicit and even urgent .  The ceremony of the havdalah  ,  the bidding adieu to the Sabbath ,  centres on the spice - box and the candle .  The blessing itself is made over a cup of wine in honour of the day ( Blessed art Thou , O Lord our God , King of the universe , who createst divers kinds of spices ) which <head>adds</head> to the light of the Sabbath , symbolised by the candle , offering a fragrance and a beauty all its own . Leonard extends this sense here in this book  to those who will read and ponder .  The book was offered with a sharp recollection of his own family ,  not only regarding his  father 's  absence of many years  ( whose duty it was ,  formally ,  to say the prayer )  ,  but in the dedication of the book ,  another link with the past broken ,  another mainstay ,  albeit distant ,  removed :  This book is dedicated to the memory of my grandmother Mrs Lyon Cohen ,  and to the memory of my grandfather Rabbi Solomon Klinitsky .

It means that we can think about things that are not present .  Sure enough ,  we would expect the input systems to ensure that the right kinds of distinctions are drawn  between contour changes that define occlusion and those which define disappearance ,  for example  but this surely does not mean that the possessor of these input systems is capable of thinking about unperceived entities .  What this <head>adds</head> up to , then , is the claim that if there existed an organism which either could not act or whose actions made no difference to its perceptions then not only would that organism not be cognisant , it could never become cognisant . ( It is not clear to me whether this is some kind of philosophical claim or an hypothesis .  You may say that it is refutable  and so it is empirical ;  but then  see below  our criteria for cognisance are so much bound up with what the subject can do that it is difficult to see how we could assess the cognisance of a totally passive creature .  )

Initially ,  an entry in a reading lexicon which matches the sequence of letters that one has detected is located .

This whole - word visual representation is then used to address and so locate its associated pronunciation in a lexicon of spoken word forms known as the speech output lexicon .

But by 1985 the sad reality had to be faced that  so far as InterCity was concerned  the market had changed ,  probably for ever .

To offset the loss of Glasgow business , extra stops were <head>added</head> to the daytime service which was revamped to serve towns such as Warrington , Wigan , Lancaster , Oxenholme and Penrith which offered greater business prospects . Only the Royal Scot  remained as a viable Euston - Glasgow train but with a schedule fifteen minutes slower than the five - hour norm established in the 1974 timetable .  At one stage the average time of the five daytime trains between Euston and Glasgow was over five and a half hours .

Indeed ,  for a time it enabled the service to become an all HST operation so that some places actually had a better service .  There were four major East Coast developments in the 1980s :  the significant increase in HST productivity so that sets could be more extensively deployed to provide service to Inverness ,  Glasgow Queen Street ,  Hull and Cleethorpes ;  electrification of the route from Hitchin to Leeds with only minor interference to train services ;  introduction of a new track - maintenance strategy and transfer of overnight Anglo - Scottish sleeping - car services to the West Coast main line .  Although the original HST plans provided for two daily return journeys between King 's Cross and Aberdeen , by judicious programming of the sets ( plus some extra sets transferred from the Western region ) it was possible to <head>add</head> on some extra trips to existing rosters . This enabled InterCity to introduce additional HSTs to Aberdeen ,  a pair of business services to Hull and Cleethorpes and an entirely new service The Highland Chieftain  between King 's  Cross and Inverness with a journey time of seven hours .  Because of the need to refuel the two power cars ,  the practical operating range of an HST set is about 1,100 miles after which the unit must visit the depot to replenish its tanks .

Steam - heated hauled stock was also eradicated ,  and the response was the reclassification of more Class 31/4s and 47/4s ,  plus the first Class 37/4s .  Longer - term planning forced BR to embark upon life - extension programmes for several locomotive types expected to be needed until well into the 1990s ,  although they were halted in 1989 before being completed .  English Electric Class 37s in particular were subjected to near - total rebuilds , involving replacement of the main generator with an alternator , regeared CP7 bogies , and in some cases Ruston or Mirrlees power unit , electric - heat generator , or ballast weights <head>added</head> to provide extra adhesion for particular freight work . Thus ,  one standard locomotive design evolved into six specialist types .  Many Brush - built Class 31s were equipped with ETH generators and given a major body overhaul ,  while some Class 47s were similarly treated .

It is not easy to achieve this effect if they do not take into account the dimension and spacing of the steps as well as their particular quality ,  which must be in tune with the music if it is to make sense .  A contradiction in style during this change of aulement  or alignment can distort the design .  Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement or alignment can <head>add</head> interest and draw attention to a dancer 's statement . for example :  the swift change from the grand dvelopp   la seconde  which Odile makes facing the audience and her sudden turn to arabesque  when she looks straight into the kneeling Siegfried 's  eyes in the Act II pas de deux of Swan Lake  ;  it is Odile 's  triumph for she knows she has won Siegfried 's  heart .  Even more exciting changes of aulement  can be found in Ashton 's  Birthday  Offering  where each soloist dances an old step at a new angle ,  without breaking the rules or older conventions of nineteenth - century ballet .

A sudden change of aulement  ,  an unusual turn in - out of legs or arms ,  or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design .  Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton 's  five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros  and Consort Lessons  .  In fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift changes <head>add</head> a touch of humour as two or more dancers compete to capture the attention of both the audience and their Colleagues . Classical dance patterns In classical ballet the patterns and groupings delineated by the dancers '  bodies are usually symmetrical and evenly balanced over the whole stage .

The most outstanding are Scottish ,  Italian and Spanish .  Scottish style  The Royal Danish Ballet 's  production of La Sylphide  is evidence of Bournonville 's  imaginative use of the Scot 's  quick light footwork and capers as well as the very distinctive Highland ports de bras  ,  which help the dancer to sustain balance .  To these features he <head>added</head> purely classical batterie , grands jets en avant and en attitude , cabrioles and quick glissades into chapps la seconde and swift changes of aulement . He also took care to make the patterns of his dances as interesting as in Scottish country dance .  Another example of this stereotyped Scottish style is danced by Swanhilda in Coppiia  .

It is thoroughly mixed in a large vessel called a mash tun with hot pure water .  The sugars dissolve into the water and the sweet liquid ,  called wort ,  is pumped to a copper .  The flowers of the hop plant <head>add</head> bitterness to beer and the oils in the plant also guard against any infections during the brewing process . As the wort is boiled in the copper with the hops many brewers also add sugars ,  such as glucose or cereal syrup ,  to encourage a strong fermentation .  CAMRA would prefer beer to be brewed solely from barley malt but the use of sugar dates back to the 19th century and many renowned beers ,  such as Marston 's  Pedigree ,  have recipes that include 10 per cent or more brewing sugars .

Enriched hop powder pellets are also possible by sieving the powder at  35C to remove coarser non a  acid material and by blending with liquid extracts to further enhance the a  acid content .  Pellets may also be stabilised by the inclusion of vitamin C  ( ascorbic acid )  to reduce oxidation .  Calcium and magnesium salts may then be <head>added</head> to partly catalyse conversion of a acids so pre - empting the boiling reactions . Losses of a  acid may be reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent by these means .  Even greater efficiency of a  acid utilisation is obtained using chemical extracts of hops .

Moreover the extraction leaves undesirable chemicals such as pesticides behind .  Carbon dioxide also offers the flexibility to separate the hop components into bitter and flavour fractions .  This advantage is considerable since the bitter fraction may then be chemically manipulated to produce bitter iso a acids from the a acids and so provide a PIKE product which may be <head>added</head> towards the end of the boil or even afterwards . Near 100 per cent utilisation of the hop a  acid is possible by this process .  Flavours may also be separated in the hop extract and can be fractionated .

Dry hop flavour is an interesting application since the use of a liquid extract allows a more accurate and consistent flavour to be produced .  Moreover whole hops used for dry hopping take seven to 10 days for the character to be extracted and then slowly decline .  Dry hop extract provides immediate character which lasts longer and reduces the possibility of infection being <head>added</head> from whole hops or , more likely , from a dirty hand . Because of the degree of processing involved ,  hop extracts are not necessarily cheaper than using whole hops .  Per unit of bitterness they are roughly as costly .

There is no such decline with extracts .  Within 30 years the brewing industry has gone from a cottage industry to high tech .  English Hops began their development of hop oils by looking at the dry hopping end of the brewing process , when a handful of whole or pellet hops are <head>added</head> to casks of beer . There can be problems of infection at this stage ,  David Gardner said .  With hop oils you can get the best from the hops ,  the essential oils and essences that can replicate the aroma and bitterness of two such disparate varieties as a Fuggle and a Golding .

Snow is more likely to cause damage to a small - mesh net .  Netting is likely to be made from either polypropylene or polythene .  Ordinary polythene netting will deteriorate within two or three seasons , but manufacturers usually <head>add</head> a uv stabiliser , which considerably extends its useful life . Different manufacturers claim widely different life expectancies for both materials ,  but you can reasonably expect a five - year life from most types  ( but as some manufacturers claim a life of only half this ,  and others double ,  check before you buy )  .  The majority of bird netting is likely to be knotted  ( this produces a fine and very flexible net )  or knitted ,  but the thickness of the thread is likely to be more important than the type of assembly .

The result is a townscape of terrible despairing cries which mean ,  and mean more than ,  that the drunks are leaving the pubs between two and three o'clock in the morning ,  the pubs that reek of alcohol and cucumber and fish .  A townscape of nightmare yellows :  sky ,  buildings ,  furniture ,  wallpaper ,  faces  the colour of age ,  heat ,  pestilence ,  bile and jaundice ,  bruisings and stainings ,  with a stronger connotation of dirt in Russian than in English ;  the colour of the tickets of identification which prostitutes were required to carry ;  the colour of Raskolnikov 's  cubbyhole of a room ;  and the colour which greets him when he comes to after fainting at the police station and sees a man holding a yellow glass filled with yellow water .  Looking over Dostoevsky 's shoulder , we find him first writing small yellow glass , then deleting small ; and writing water then <head>adding</head> yellow warm to the water , then deleting warm the final text uniting an apocalyptic starkness of yellow meets yellow with the topicality of Petersburg 's notoriously filthy water supply , a subject of much comment and complaint in the newspapers . At such moments we come  as close as it is possible to get to the spirit of Crime and Punishment  .  Having ,  as I say ,  abandoned everything he had done ,  he sat down and wrote a six - part novel within a year which included a twenty - six day break in which he threw together and dictated The Gambler  ,  itself not a small book nor a negligible one ,  to satisfy the terms of a contract he had made with a shyster publisher .

And , he <head>adds</head> , I have found them . This has the same free ,  metaphysical bearing on his being a drunkard that Raskolnikov 's  wanting to dare has on his being a murderer .  Moreover ,  as always in Dostoevsky ,  the search for suffering refuses to settle into coherent masochistic focus .

The novelist is now of course in middle age , but right back in his teens he wrote to his brother Man is a mystery , <head>adding</head> that a lifetime spent trying to unravel the mystery would not be wasted .

If we take wanting everybody to look at him as the real reason ,  then the case of Stavrogin is  ( in the lawyer 's  phrase )  on all fours with that of the underground man 's  indecent exposure of consciousness .  However ,  I invite nobody into my soul he declares ,  as if to banish the exhibitionist thought.44 And then if the search for suffering is allowed to eclipse the rest ,  we are back with Marmeladov squinnying into the bottom of his vodka jug ;  whereas Stavrogin saying he wants to forgive himself might be Raskolnikov pondering retrospectively ,  selfcritically ,  on his admission of guilt at the police station .  To Marmeladov , Raskolnikov , and the underground man , I now <head>add</head> Svidrigailov , because the chief enormity which is being confessed , or merely admitted to , or flaunted , or feigned , binds Stavrogin to the America - minded debauchee no less tightly than does the boredom theme of the At Tikhon 's chapter . As with the highly misleading phrase Stavrogin 's  Confession ,  critics and commentators behave as if they had got into a huddle .

Laser beams consist of photons which ,  though small by atomic standards ,  have a cumulative inertial effect ,  Dr Carl Wieman of the University of Colorado ,  who heads one research group ,  says that cooling an atom with a laser beam is like trying to slow down movement of a heavy object by bombarding it with ping - pong balls .  In practice it is quite complex because you need at least six lasers to trap a clump of atoms ;  the lasers also have to be tuned to the natural movement of the atoms .  Otherwise the effect is to <head>add</head> heat energy rather than remove it . What Wieman has done  as well as reaching the lowest temperature on record  is to simplify what has been an immensely complex piece of laboratory apparatus .  Not only has the essential large vacuum cell been reduced to a small glass cell ,  but Wieman has also been able to replace gas lasers with solid state devices .

Traffic message control  ( TMC )  ,  under development as one of the European Drive projects ,  may bring RDS a little nearer to Carfax .  This is seen as using RDS as a data channel of very limited capacity in conjunction with a speech synthesis chip or possibly some form of printer in the car  ( it could provide automatic translation when travelling abroad )  as a means of sending traffic telegrams to cars without interrupting the radio programmes .  But TMC seems bound to <head>add</head> much extra intricacy to the already complicated RDS receiver . D Kopitz  ( EBU )  in discussing  development of TMC admits that :  The TMC device will probably be too complex to permit its incorporation within a standard car radio case .  It will also require it own RF tuner  ( VHF )  to permit the car radio listener a free choice of listening entertainment ,  without obligation to tune to the particular programme service which carries TMC information .

A key text is his early essay ,  Structure ,  Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences ,  which concludes that there are two possible interpretations of interpretation :  The one seeks to decipher ,  dreams of deciphering a truth or an origin which escapes play and the order of the sign ,  and which lives the necessity of interpretation as an exile .  The other ,  which is no longer turned toward the origin ,  affirms play and tries to pass beyond man and humanism . Derrida says that these two interpretations are absolutely irreconcilable , even though , he <head>adds</head> in his gnomic fashion , we reconcile them in an obscure economy . It is his second interpretation ,  deriving substantially from Nietzsche ,  that has become dominant in deconstruction as popularly understood ,  where all meaning is turned into play .  And it is this approach which leads to denunciation of Derrida as a  nihilist ;  in Frederick Crews 's  words ,  an intellectual nihilist ,  though a learned and exuberant one .

The publicity his ideas have attracted has only deepened the tragedy : the bad influence of those he has himself influenced has <head>added</head> frivolity to the obscurity Derrida 's  admirers ,  and perhaps some disinterested observers ,  would reject such charges as based on misunderstandings of his work .

To identify English as peculiarly problematical should not weaken the general defence of humane values in education ,  and may in the longer run help to strengthen them .  A successful military campaign may require giving up some  tactically untenable territory .  Having taught English Literature for a long time in universities , on both sides of the Atlantic , and having spent some years pondering the questions raised in this book , I have come to some very tentative conclusions about what might be done ; they are not , I might <head>add</head> , of the kind I thought I would come to when I began working on it . In the wake of the MacCabe affair in 1981 ,  an editorial in the Times Higher Education Supplement  said that a fissiparous discipline such as English had a number of hard choices in front of it :  it could become even more pluralistic and diffuse ,  with accompanying pedagogic problems ;  it could repressively impose one favoured approach ;  or it could split .  Raymond Williams came to think that a splitting of the discipline was increasingly likely ,  since cultural materialism and radical semiotics were not compatible with the dominant paradigm of literary study :  For these necessarily include the paradigm itself as a matter for analysis ,  rather than as a governing definition of the object of knowledge .

But in every age there have been poets who were uninterested in thus cutting their poems free of any but a linguistic reality ,  poets who are realistic and mimetic in the most straightforward senses of those two complicated words .  In our age Pound ,  far more than Eliot or Yeats ,  is such a poet .  And yet we have seen that the topography of Sligo ( to which one should <head>add</head> the topography of at least one part of London , Bedford Park ) is illuminating for the reader of Yeats . And who is to say that the topography of the Somerset village of East Coker is unimportant to a reading of Eliot 's  four Quartets  ?  And yet how few of us have made that pilgrimage !

The poem ,  we might say ,  is in two minds about itself and its own meaning .   But that is not the whole story .  For Pound undoubtedly made the poem more obscure by asking for the excision of some transitional and bridging passages where the language was not at full pressure , but on the other hand he caused to be removed some extended sections which , being plainly extraneous , could only have <head>added</head> to readers ' bafflement . Moreover in some important respects Pound was more old - fashioned than Eliot .  As his later disastrous interventions in politics would make clear ,  he was a realist in quite a simple - minded sense ,  one who was concerned for public life ,  and believed  ( like activists of the Left )  that a poet had the right and the duty to act in and upon that life quite directly ;  whereas the oddly distant weariness of Eliot 's  political pronouncements ,  even when he was most engag  as editor of True Criterion  ,  revealed a man for whom the psychological reality of private torments took priority over any reality which announced itself as social and public .

The first swap was in December 1983 but the council had not begun to play the market in earnest until late 1987 .

Mr Howell <head>added</head> : No advice was obtained about the legality of the deals . That lack of authorisation by councillors was one of the four grounds on which the auditor was trying to prove the transactions were unlawful .

THE SOVIET government is introducing emergency measures to stave off a winter economic crisis ,  including a 15 - month ban on strikes in key industries and drastic moves to ensure the normal operation of the country 's  railways  above all to break Azerbaijan 's  blockade of Armenia .  A resolution enshrining the decisions is to be voted on by deputies today .  Last night a large majority approved a motion to that effect by Mikhail Gorbachev , who admitted more bluntly than ever before that reforms , far from strengthening the economy , were merely <head>adding</head> to its immediate difficulties . We cannot wait any longer ,  the Soviet leader said .  Every extra day brings terrible consequences .

The company said that the first six months of the year have seen more new business than during any previous period .

Hoare Govett was identified as an early buyer ,  pointing the finger at British Aerospace ,  one of the stockbroking firm 's  corporate clients .  Another Hoare Govett client is STC .  British Aerospace <head>added</head> to the speculation by refusing officially to confirm or deny the story . However ,  well - informed sources ruled out both British Aerospace and STC as buyers ,  saying they believed Hoare Govett was acting on behalf of normal investment clients or Middle Eastern investors with an interest in Ferranti 's  future .  Stock market sources said that the Hoare Govett buying dried up after about 60 million Ferranti shares had been traded ,  at which point Smith New Court stepped in and remained an aggressive buyer at 56p until the close .

Meanwhile ,  Cecil Parkinson ,  the Secretary of State for Transport ,  said the Government had ruled out any idea of helping to fund the ailing project .  Shares in Eurotunnel fell a further 50p to close at 600p ,  making a 15 per cent drop in the Anglo - French venture 's  stock market value in the two days since it disclosed a 50 per cent rise in the cost of the tunnel to at least 7bn .  Interviewed on the French TV channel Antenne 2 , Mr Benard conceded that the underestimate of the project 's costs poses really serious problems for us , although he <head>added</head> : There is no question of stopping work at this time . The banks financing the huge project have given Eurotunnel until the end of the year to come up with an agreed costing for completion of the tunnel sufficient to enable them to release fresh loans .  Their technical advisers ,  the American engineering consultancy Parsons de Leuw Cather and the German consultancy Lahmeyer International ,  estimate the cost of the project now at 8.1bn .

The President said that if the United States and Pakistan were really serious in wishing to settle the Afghan problem they should acknowledge the new reality in Afghanistan ,  where seven months after the departure of Soviet troops the PDPA had become more united and strengthened ,  while the guerrillas were in total disarray .  He and his government colleagues were confident they could hold their own against the mujahedin .  Pakistan and the United States would eventually have to accept direct talks with the PDPA , he said , <head>adding</head> that neither country had so far implemented any peace process . The West gave us hours to survive ,  then days ,  then weeks and now they give us seasons ,  but they should learn from the time that has elapsed already ,  he said .  He dismissed reports that his party was divided over tactics and personalities .

British officals have to tread a fine line between registering the UK dimension ,  as they call it ,  in the Trident debate ,  and not offending Congressmen by being too heavy - handed .

In his letter to Congressmen , Admiral Trost <head>added</head> that if the budget cuts were sustained there will be a catastrophic impact on the Trident programme that would involve losses of nuclear deterrent capability for many years .

But Ms Short <head>added</head> : Women share our values but we are seen by these women as male dominated and the most unsympathetic of all the parties .

Others ,  including myself ,  believe that non - punitive but truly compensatory damages awarded by the courts of the United Kingdom are preferable to the exorbitance of emotionally - driven jury awards ,  he said .  Although it is argued that fear of punitive jury awards has made the US business safety - conscious ,  quite a price has had to be paid for that by way of corporate and insurance company bankruptcy ,  the closing of municipal facilities and the practice of defensive medicine .  The way to police safety , which hits at those responsible without penalising innocent shareholders , lies in the risk of criminal prosecution of senior management and others , where profit is put before life and limb , Mr McIntosh <head>added</head> . But Mr Pannone said that while the Director of Public Prosecutions had decided eventually to prosecute P  O European Ferries and directors and employees over the Herald of Free Enterprise tragedy ,  he had decided against prosecutions over the King 's  Cross fire .  It remains to be seen ,  if there is a conviction in Zeebrugge ,  what the penalties will be .

The press ,  at Ivry ,  a suburb south - east of Paris ,  is the most technologically advanced in Europe and will enable Le Monde to print in colour and to produce 64 - page newspaper ,  a third as much again .
