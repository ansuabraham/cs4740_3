In Victorian Britain or France during the Second Empire the critic had some influence over taste .  It is doubtful how much influence a critic has today ,  though high claims are made for Clement Greenberg as the promoter of American Abstract Expressionism .  A cynic will remember that research into the opinion - forming powers of newspapers has tended to conclude that readers <head>expect</head> to have their existing views confirmed . If so ,  the power of critics may be no more than the listings services offered in the papers or on posters ,  while real power can be found in the organisation of the art market .  A different sort of exhibition which has had some success in attracting attention ,  and thus newspaper coverage ,  is the prize competition .

This will be disappointing for a reader who <head>expects</head> at the least some evaluation of the shows . The arguments put forward can be interesting in themselves ,  but their drift is often towards making the context of the art shown more understandable .  Art politics or cultural history are favourite themes for such reviewers ,  apart from the spectrum of cognate disciplines which may be the specialities of writers who are only occasionally concerned with art .

It was a Romantic notion that there were resonances in the natural world and art ;  and it was Schiller who argued that music ,  the visual arts and poetry always become similar in their action on the mind .  THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE Describing the object is not the only sort of description that a reader can <head>expect</head> from a critic . The critic may be willing to share an experience with the reader ,  sometimes only of the circumstances in which a work was seen ,  as might be included in a personality article ;  but on other occasions the critic may give a fuller account of a personal response to a work of art .  This then becomes not a description of the object itself ,  but of the critical appreciation or dislike that the work gives rise to .

The novel is narrated by a Moslem of Indian origin ,  whose family has been settled on the east coast of Africa ,  as traders .

A play really demands to be read aloud  - it needs the sound of the human voice to bring it alive .  It takes imagination and a lot of practice to read a play to yourself in the same time as it would take to see it on the stage .  Surprisingly , this is true of both the classical and modern play , though you might <head>expect</head> that the obscurities and difficulties of words and expression would prove more of a stumbling block in , say , Shakespeare or Ben Jonson . Here is a suggested first reading list ,  which I 've put together to provide a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's  development .  There is a danger in reading the classics ,  in that they can come to be regarded simply as literature  so always try to look at them as plays for performance   and ,  it goes without saying ,  try to see as much theatre as you can .

Sodalities ,  such as the Legion of Mary ,  Opus Dei ,  and Christian Life communities ,  have partially extended this form of commitment to some ,  particularly more middle - class laity ,  and continue to have an important role in activating laity for what are judged to be religious goals both personally and socially .  But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed , with clergy being left behind in some areas , the clerics remain the true cognoscenti in religious matters , and are <head>expected</head> to be so by the laity . This has always added to the clergy 's  spiritual authority and status ,  and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals ,  with the high clergy deciding what constitutes matters of faith and morals .  The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life .

However ,  it was not simply a strategy ,  but  embodied a particular ideology :  the belief that the bishops were the church above all ,  and that they ,  not the laity ,  were the ones to communicate with the state .  The desire to make arrangements covertly could well have been affected by a double pressure .  On the one hand , the laity would not understand the complexity of the issues because of their poor understanding of Christian doctrine and the intricacies of morality ; on the other , the area of the sacred in the political arena was clearly defined , and clear guidance from the clerical church was both necessary and <head>expected</head> by good Christian politicians . What the bishops and the politicians had come up against in the Mother and Child controversy was that this paternalistic conceptualization was intrinsically at odds with the common understanding of democracy .  This appears to be the first contradiction which the bishops later sought to resolve by withdrawing from the direct contact method .

With the exception of a small group of public schools ,  there is the apparently simple distinction between state schools and Roman catholic schools which occurs in Britain .  However ,  it would be nive to think that control of the state sector ,  its general ethos ,  and the teaching of religious education was non - denominational .  These schools are protestant , though nothing else is perhaps to lie <head>expected</head> when protestant loyalist teachers teach protestant loyalist children . Religious education in these schools is officially non - denominational or biblically based and loyalist sentiments are promoted .  But religious education has been known to be fundamentalist and in some cases anti - catholic ,  depending on the teacher .

Unfortunately ,  Rose did not elaborate on the nature of such mixed schooling experiences .  They  could even have proven to be the negative experience of small ethnic enclaves defending themselves in hostile environments ,  but even this viewpoint can only be speculation .  Murray ( 1983 ; 1985 ) advised not to <head>expect</head> too much of schools on the basis of his own in - depth research into two primary schools , one from each Northern group . He has also sought support for this view from studies of separate and mixed schooling of different ethnic groups in other countries .  Such studies ,  he argued ,  have shown that joint schooling is not necessarily successful in lowering prejudice .

In the most extreme cases the existing building is so different from the historic pub concept that a virtual rebuild is proposed .  At the Huntsman 's  Inn in Ide ,  Kent ,  the refurbishment proposals were to involve demolitions so extensive that all but a portion of the building 's  external wall would be destroyed ,  the planned reconstruction included an extension that would double the size of the original structure .  It seems most surprising that the breweries consider the large open space to be the pub 's ideal internal form , or believe the artificial , standardised historic pub interior to be preferable to genuine historic detail , when the original internal divisions and features are essential elements of the historic character that customers <head>expect</head> when entering such a building . The Duke 's  Arms at Presteigne in Powys provides the perfect illustration of how the misguided quest for the ideal traditional pub character can seriously threaten genuine historic features .  This pub was originally a 17th century timber frame jettied building ;  in the early 19th century its front was removed and a new rendered facade added .

Perhaps their essence is more difficult to grasp because they are perceived by customers in entirely different roles ,  depending on the customer  for example ,  as friend ,  wine expert or simple emissary of the kitchen .  Tact and diplomacy ,  knowledge and friendship define the great restaurant managers ,  just as a great chef is defined by his skills in producing superb food .  The kitchen 's perception of the restaurant manager is also fragmented in that the kitchen <head>expects</head> that manager to feed back customer response . So many chefs feel their restaurant managers fail to do this adequately .  Similarly ,  a good front - of - house manager can give the customer an insight and appreciation of the chef 's  ideas and foods .

Research in the police ,  Irving further asserts ,  is a matter of pragmatics ,  eliminating philosophical enquiry into systems of belief ,  or how the knowledge of an ideology is transformed into action .  In the end ,  only the action is viable ,  so that all these essays tend to match the inside ethnography and are nullified by neglect or have any contentious matter treated as privileged information ,  for as Templeton  ( 1980 :  904 )  argues the police fear that if you have a better understanding of society ,  you are in a better position to change it  the very exercise they are reluctant to engage in .  Those who do go public are disloyal and there are thinly veiled attempts to dismiss the value of any revelation they make , for they are <head>expected</head> to remain silent and uncritical . When Ronald Gregory ,  the ex - chief constable of West Yorkshire ,  said little or nothing new about the Yorkshire Ripper case in a series of newspaper articles ,  he was castigated in Police Review   ( 1 July 1983 )  and they republished a 1979 photograph of him when his loyalty was unquestioned .  John Alderson ,  the ex - chief constable of Devon and Cornwall has suffered even more from his subsequent public persona ,  because of a move into academia ,  some critical publications ,  and a flirtation with the political life .

( Police  magazine ,  May 1981 ;  my emphases )  Inevitably those few insiders who do undertake postgraduate research in the social sciences are aware that they are involved in the creation of clap trap ,  and must know that this denigration stems from the implicit threat they pose to the structures of pedagogy and institutional power .  Those who pursue explication can <head>expect</head> to be seen as suspicious , for they embody the marginality of the anthropologist , described by Lvi - Strauss ( 1973 : 67 ) as being someone who is psychologically speaking maimed , an amputee . This maimed psyche ,  according to Francis Huxley  ( 1970 :  62 )  ,  creates a specific concept of the self and makes the inside anthropologist a mutilated man in curious revolt against his own society .  In such a world many graduates learn to play down their qualifications ,  for they know the hostility which exists towards academia and realize the significance of practical ability gained in the university of real life .

Alternative readings or critical analysis of this entrenched reverence for a rule of law  ( which at times may well be out of step with a wider interpretation of ambiguous social behaviour )  smacks of subversion simply because it denies the primacy of the institutional framework .  And surely ,  it can be argued ,  the understanding of what is to be ordered and who is to be disciplined has long been defined and subject to the practical mastery of the controllers .  In consequence , even when the insider retires and ostensibly leaves the family , he will be <head>expected</head> to maintain his silence , and although bland hagiographic biography has been acceptable in the past , there has been no place for the espionage of critical ethnography . And even as the unlamented Official Secrets Act of 1911 groaned in its death throes in the late 1980s  ( to be replaced by an even more constraining measure )  ,  officers about to retire in West Mercia were presented with an official force form and asked to sign a Declaration under the Act .

Hopefully ,  he can use the creativity which exists between the experiential inside view and observational outside view of a cultural system to formulate an ethnography which incorporates a continuous dialectical ,  tacking between the most local of detail and the most global of global structures in such a  way as to bring them into simultaneous view  ( Geertz ibid .  235 )  .  But it is not just how the new consciousness is to be used which produces problems in handling this new - found wisdom ;  it is the very acquisition of knowledge itself which makes the concept of self so dynamic .  This structural awareness can be as hard to handle as any decision to try to publish the account , for what has happened in the past and what is <head>expected</head> now from the insider is tied up with an understanding of how the institution of policing prefers to present a restricted image for outside consumption , as I have described above . It all becomes uncomfortably apparent and that which had been lived and accepted is opened up in a revelatory manner ,  so that the vice of being caught up within the hegemonies of such a system designed to control a powerless underclass can become overbearing .  In such a situation ,  the necessary intellectual detachment often becomes difficult to sustain .

For although it is constantly argued that the police represent and are drawn from the community they serve ,  the cultural style required in the body of the police officer inevitably sets him slightly apart from the civvies outside the institution ,  especially where such symbolic use of clothing and beards or hair is the province of the youthful innovator .  Always the police prefer to exhibit bodily constraint in their styles ,  for restraint and decorum have a symbolic history as an indication of subcultural insider purity ,  a comfort with a vanishing status quo ,  and a rejection of the changing outside world .  This restraint <head>expected</head> in police hair was clearly illustrated in a large poster exhibited in the Northumbria police training department in the early 1980s , which ordered : male hair will be clear of the collar and sideburns will not extend below the centre of the ear . Faris  ( 1968 )  ,  exploring the way such symbols come to represent complex conceptual domains ,  coined the phrase symbols of high meaning capacity ,  which exactly fits the structural significance hair has for police ideology .  In effect it becomes a reflection of an almost puritanical social containment of the individual ,  with metaphoric import as a statement of correctness for the society outside .

In some cases the disqualification is not only from a particular event within a tournament ,  but from the whole tournament .

Thus if I incur a verbal warning for stepping out of the area , I do n't then <head>expect</head> to receive a half - point penalty for a slight contravention of another rule. You will not be penalised if you are propelled from the area !  Prohibited actions and behaviour

The second important point is ,  do n't kick unless you have a target .  Many people seemingly throw a kick in the hope of hitting something .  As you might <head>expect</head> , this inevitably leads to bruised insteps , toes and shins . The cocked fist in a reverse punch travels just over a metre to its target .

This must of necessity put you in a very weak defensive position and I would maintain that this is responsible for losing more bouts than any other factor .  The kick misses ,  recovery is slow and the alert opponent has scored before you know what 's  happened .  It therefore makes sense to use kicks judiciously only when there is a clear opening and the opponent is not <head>expecting</head> a kick . Bag work is essential for training competition kicks .  Much modern training aims kicks against the air ,  so the effect of recoil is never experienced .

Tournament organisers and the refereeing panel <head>expect</head> competitors to come to the tournament in a fit state to compete , not shrouded in bandages ! Therefore you may find that a bandage is not allowed if you did n't incur the injury in that day 's  competition .

I fear not ,  for indeed they hearkened not unto Moses ,  they murmured against him ,  and against Aaron ,  which is to say ,  they murmured against the Lord ,  for was it not the Lord Himself ,  speaking and working in  Moses ,  who had brought them out from the land of Egypt ?  And so the words turned back on themselves ,  phrases reappeared ,  seeming to confirm other phrases ,  merely repeating themselves ,  clicking into place with a semblance of logic which nicely disguised the truth that all these words were nothing but a glittering fabric which hovered above the ground ,  unwinding endlessly ,  slipping between the fingers ,  beguiling like a mirage ,  taking on whatever shape the conjuror wanted ,  and leading nowhere .

Like transitional relief ,  community charge reductions will provide payments to some people who face high increases because of the changeover from rates to community charge .  Community charge reductions are worked out after the bills originally set by councils have been reduced by 140 as explained on page 2 .  Because bills are now lower , fewer people face large increases , so the number of people entitled to a reduction will be less than originally <head>expected</head> . The rules are more generous than those for transitional relief and some of the basic points are :  Community charge reductions are only available to people who have not moved since 31st March 1991 .

Traditionally operators with insufficient passengers simply cancelled ;  BR now insisted that 10 per cent of the train hire charge  in some cases as much as 500  be paid as a non - returnable deposit .  Since previously only about one in three advertised charter trains actually ran  ( there were indeed up to a hundred independent rail tour operators )  ,  the new regime immediately brought a crop of casualties ,  including in 1985 the Rail Tour Operators Association ,  the very organisation which had been established at Ward 's  insistence to negotiate train hire on behalf of all independents .

Some important changes were made to maintenance arrangements ,  whereby locomotives became attached first and foremost to specific traffic flows rather than to a defined geographical area .

It originally closed to freight traffic on 14 May 1984 .  One worrying aspect concerning the reopening of freight lines to passengers is that invariably where such revivals have taken place ,  BR has badly underestimated the level of business .

This figure was rapidly exceeded and by 1989 was carrying one million passengers annually ,  necessitating lengthening platforms at several stations along its route at a cost of 60,000 .  Worthy of mention in this review of closures and revivals is the widely applauded reprieve by Chris Green ,  director of Network SouthEast ,  of London 's  Marylebone station on 30 April 1986 .

The popularity is put down to a good flavour  with its tight creamy head it 's  similar to Tetley 's   the lack of any other light bitters in Nicholson 's  range that compete with it and a slight price advantage of around five pence .  I disputed the latter with Tony who conceded that the differential existed more because it was expected by customers than in any attempt to persuade them to buy the beer in preference to another .  Nicholson 's customers are not price sensitive explains Tony , although he stresses that this is different to not <head>expecting</head> value for money . He said :  Our strengths are the freehouse image ,  the quality of our property and the standards set by our managers .  If we get these areas right then price is not particularly relevant .

And there we were again ,  at the foot of the pitch of our failure ,  two pitches from the Fish .

We were in Kenya ,  and our buffalo encounter was in the Leroghi Hills ,  a small range to the south of Lake Turkana ,  the Jade Sea of John Hillaby 's  book .  The main objective of our visit was to climb Mount Kenya ,  Africa 's  second highest mountain ,  but walking in the Leroghis formed an important part of our preparation .  Before leaving Britain we 'd learnt that the hike up to Mount Kenya 's walkers summit , Point Lenana , was not too demanding , and that the climbing route up to the twin summits of Batian and Nelion was graded mainly Diff , with a few patches of Severe , so we were n't <head>expecting</head> any technical problems . But Mount Kenya is over 17,000ft  ( 5100m )  and we 'd also learnt that many walkers and climbers fail to reach the top simply because of altitude sickness .  So ,  instead of going straight for the big one ,  we decided to build up our acclimatisation by first visiting some of Kenya 's  other mountains .

Netting is likely to be made from either polypropylene or polythene .  Ordinary polythene netting will deteriorate within two or three seasons ,  but manufacturers usually add a uv stabiliser ,  which considerably extends its useful life .  Different manufacturers claim widely different life expectancies for both materials , but you can reasonably <head>expect</head> a five - year life from most types ( but as some manufacturers claim a life of only half this , and others double , check before you buy ) . The majority of bird netting is likely to be knotted  ( this produces a fine and very flexible net )  or knitted ,  but the thickness of the thread is likely to be more important than the type of assembly .  A reinforced edge adds strength and is useful for a fruit cage .

The Crime and Punishment  notebooks expend considerable effort trying to establish an overarching reason or at least an empirical scatter of factors ,  and failing .

In the novel itself , where we might <head>expect</head> Marmeladov to speak of solace , respite , forgetting , companionship , he grasps the paradox that he drinks because he is in search of suffering , of tears and tribulation . And ,  he adds ,  I have found them .  This has the same free ,  metaphysical bearing on his being a drunkard that Raskolnikov 's  wanting to dare has on his being a murderer .

That the members of the quintet will be bound to each other in secret guilt by the cement of blood ,  having been tricked into thinking Shatov is a danger and must be removed ,  is another and a promising rationalization which reveals a local shrewdness like Iago 's  .  I stress local :  Verkhovensky 's  group psychology is plausible enough but it does n't engage with anything wider or further that he proposes to do .  He postures as a political activist , and the solidarity forced on the quintet by Shatov 's murder might be <head>expected</head> to make them a more effective instrument . But the notion of an instrument turns out to be as empty as his posturing .  There is nothing he wants to use the quintet for .

To take one 's  finger off the bounding narrative pulse of Crime and Punishment  and to open The Possessed   to open it anywhere  is to find oneself out in the sticks once again :  the our town of the novel and the voice relating its affairs bring back the we of convict life in The House of the Dead  and the more sketchy collective of that remote Siberian community outside the prison walls .  The same dilating and contracting principle informs both novels ,  a first - person narrator who moves between we all thought and it was just my hunch ,  though the swing is greater in The Possessed  and its figuration much more complex .  If any House of the Dead notebooks had survived I would <head>expect</head> them to contain sudden leaps of discovery and creative arrivals like Most important it 's a chronicle 'and I 've had breakfast .

Leavis 's  judgements were very much his own ,  laboriously arrived at ,  and presented with subtlety and rigour .  But these judgements were then taken over and pre - packaged for pedagogic purposes ,  so one had the spectacle of the Leavisite schoolmaster or university teacher who presented his students with duplicated copies of ,  say ,  sonnets by Hopkins and Rossetti ,  which they were invited to compare and contrast in evaluative terms .  There was no doubt that they were <head>expected</head> to admire the former and scorn the latter ; anyone misguided enough to get the preference the wrong way round , would be regarded as at best nave and misguided , and at worst corrupted in sensibility . Denys Thompson 's  Reading and Discrimination   ( 1934 )  is a collection of such comparative exercises .  Leavisism assumed that its rewriting of the canon had a once - and - for - all quality ,  so that it was inconceivable that anyone could come to admire Shelley again ,  though this is precisely what has happened under the influence of Harold Bloom ,  who is dedicated to overturning the Eliot - Leavis version of poetic history .

There is ,  of course ,  an immense amount to be learned from good critics ,  but the critic 's  role and tone are not those of a teacher .

This formula may characterize the best form of discussion .  But it is disingenuous for academics to pretend that they can participate in such  discussion on terms of complete equality with their students ,  for there are questions of power and authority involved ;  at the end of the day ,  grades and marks ,  assessing and examining ,  come into the picture .

Gary Freeman ,  for instance ,  the scorer of the tries which knocked Britain out of the World Cup last year ,  was yesterday to be seen vainly flapping after Roy Haggerty ,  prior to Neil Holding 's  all - important drop goal .  The Kiwis wasted two excellent try opportunties with careless forward passes ,  and gifted St Helens the opening try when David Watson allowed Alan Hunte a 15th - minute interception .

Lacking a goal that might have altered its chemistry ,  it remained a matter of dull physics .  Yet many of the crowd were kept interested by the possibility of victory ,  which is ,  I suppose ,  what derbies are about .  They are so frequent these days in London , which has eight of 20 First Division clubs , that we must <head>expect</head> aesthetic considerations to be overridden . Why ,  though ,  could these supposed championship contenders not have tried to emulate the fine passing that had sprinkled the previous weekend 's  Merseyside joust ?  The simple answer is that Chelsea are in a false position and Arsenal ,  on this evidence ,  slightly jaded champions .

Although the policy review will be endorsed by the conference ,  giving Neil Kinnock the freedom to go on to the offensive against the Conservatives in the run - up to the next general election ,  there are a number of areas of potential conflict .  Calls for consideration of electoral reform and a new form of black representation are both expected to be defeated .  Ron Todd , the general secretary of the transport workers ' union , said that today 's vote on the multilaterist nuclear defence policy would not yield the massive and overwhelming majority predicted by right - wingers , and he warned that party leaders could not <head>expect</head> everybody to goose - step in the same direction once the policy had been carried . The conference opened with Labour buoyed by a series of weekend opinion polls giving leads of from 5 to 12 points .  Soviet Union faces serious energy shortage

View from City Road :  Grim prospects for Ferranti By DEREK PAIN FERRANTI'S shares return to active trading today after a three - week suspension and are <head>expected</head> to open at around 45p . That is a sharp decline from the 73.5p at which they were suspended and reflects the financial havoc which has been wrought on the company 's  accounts as a consequence of the problems at its ISC Technologies subsidiary .  Ferranti has said that its revised net worth will have to be reduced by 185m forcing the company to abandon the final dividend payment for the year to March 1989 .

THE ACQUISITIVE advertising and marketing company WCRS Group more than doubled pre - tax profits to 38.1m for the year to June ,  largely the result of a first full year contribution from its French affiliate Carat .  The result ,  on revenues which totalled 568.86m  ( 407.68m )  ,  was bloated by a 14 months accounting period as the UK - listed group fell into line with French reporting practice .  Even so , the slightly better - than - <head>expected</head> performance translated into earnings per share which rose 26 per cent to 26.92p , fully diluted for preference share conversions . WCRS is paying a 5p final dividend ,  up from 3.95p last time .  The group ,  which began as a four - way partnership in 1979 ,  is on the verge of lifting its stake in Carat ,  Europe 's  largest independent media buying company ,  as part of its continuing metamorphosis .

But its decisions also have implications for an international debate on the frontiers of medical science ,  morality ,  government action and individual privacy .  The three abortion cases ,  which may be reached in December ,  are unlikely to lead to a clean reversal of Roe v Wade ,  the 1973 Supreme Court ruling which granted an absolute right to abortion in the first three months of pregnancy and an almost unrestricted right in the next three .  On the basis of a 5 - 4 majority in a Missouri case judged in July , the cases are <head>expected</head> to lead to expansion of the right of individual states to pass laws regulating abortions . Laurence Tribe ,  Professor of Law at Harvard University ,  said he thought the session would continue to chip away at the broad right to abortion .  The court may never say Roe v Wade is overruled ,  but it is likely to say ,  Roe v Wade never heard of it .  ' In two cases ,  involving a Minnesota state law and an Ohio law ,  the court must decide whether a teenager should inform one or both parents before having an abortion .

Lord James Douglas - Hamilton MP ,  Scottish Office environment minister ,  said it would be additional to the public road building programme and could start by 1992 or 1993  against a delay until the next century if it had to await public funding .  He added :  At this stage I ca n't give you any indication of what level the toll might be it depends on the amount of interest from industry and commerce .  He <head>expected</head> it to become toll free after 15 to 20 years . The project is contained in a Scottish Office consultation document proposing 200m - plus of improvements to the trunk road system south of Edinburgh .  It describes the suggested fastlink  stretching 25 miles from the M8 Edinburgh - Glasgow motorway to the M74 at Douglas in Lanarkshire  as the most important road proposal to emerge from the study .

Coverage for an initial eight - month experiment starts next month alongside the introduction of cameras to Parliament .  The contract ,  which contains the same strict rules as those governing coverage of Parliament ,  has been awarded to Barraclough Carey Productions  -  which Mr Carey founded with a BBC documentary producer ,  Jenny Barraclough  -  and Sevenday Productions ,  whose director ,  John Underwood ,  is a former ITN home affairs correspondent .  Mr Carey , 46 , a distinguished BBC journalist for 23 years , said he <head>expected</head> to liaise constantly with broadcasters on what footage they required . Payment would be based on a pooled system :  if everyone wanted the same coverage costs would be shared .  If only one broadcaster wanted something ,  it would bear the cost .
