British Medical Journal  ( Source :  BMJ 1991 )  ;  302 :  2037 )  These factors help to explain why the total number of clients covered at any one time by our London 24 hour on - call service more than doubled from 70 in April 1990 to 150 by March 1991 ;  and why the provision of service has had to become so much more sophisticated .  For example the numbers needing opiates to control pain are rising and up to one in five will need special battery - <head>operated</head> syringe pumps to deliver medication in the home . Over the next twelve months we expect a further increase in those needing our Home Care service to enable them to live and die at home .   P.

I am afraid that by taking the extraordinary measure of stapling this report because some of the contents are so disturbing ,  Amnesty has again given credence to the belief that recent torture in Kuwait has been more terrible than in any other part of the world ,  whereas the repugnant patterns of pain - infliction described are all too familiar from Iran ,  from Myanmar ,  Amin 's  Uganda ,  a South America ,  South Africa etc. Although we may claim that we simply publish an objective report ,  the inference that exceptional evil existed during the occupation of Kuwait will naturally be made by those trying to justify the devastating Allied bombardment of Iraq ,  now retrospectively .

Should that unthinkable thing happen ,  and you forget your lines ,  do n't despair .  A sympathetic panel may well ask you to start again .  But there is no trick to the business of learning lines , as you will find out as you go on although learning lines for an audition is different from memorising a part in a play for production , because then you will be <head>operating</head> with other actors around you . On the whole ,  acting in isolation is a peculiar feature of the audition system ,  which is why the pieces you choose in either the classic or modern text need to be reasonably well contained and lend themselves to being performed as a one man show .  If you have done any class work before attempting the drama school audition ,  most of the teachers will at some point in their sessions have talked about relaxation .

Left to its own devices ,  real ale stays in a drinkable condition for about a week .  When the pub landlord or cellarman considers that the beer is ready to serve  it is said to have dropped bright with the sediment of yeast in the belly of the cask ,  and to have matured sufficiently  a long plastic tube is connected to the tap and the beer is ready to be pulled to the bar .  The most familiar method of serving real ale is the beer engine , a simple suction pump <head>operated</head> by a tall handpump on the bar . When the handle is pulled the engine delivers a half pint of beer to the bar .  Some pubs ,  mainly in the Midlands and the North ,  use electric pumps to draw the beer to the bar .

As Arendt  ( 1958 )  indicated ,  the more public a group ,  the less power it is likely to have .  Real power ,  she clearly demonstrates ,  begins where secrecy exists .  It should come as no surprise , therefore , to find that detailed ethnography of police social practice is antithetical to the philosophies of control by which they <head>operate</head> . Yet in a liberal democracy ,  such a declaration cannot easily be made ;  indeed the opposite must be proclaimed .  To carry out participant observation into the minutiae of police practice might be theoretically approved in any statement made for general consumption ,  but in the cold light of institutional reality it will most likely be thwarted or subverted even as it is being agreed .

Such a mood of concern has existed now for more than a decade and seems to mirror uncertainties of role occurring elsewhere in society .  For example ,  it can be argued the expansion into amalgamated police units has enlarged the organization to a point where it is no longer accessible to the man in the street ;  alternatively ,  it may be that the use of a centralized computer and complex technical aids has alienated the public even at the same time they are increasingly fed a diet of violent news snippets which reinforce a fear of crime and generate another folk devil of criminal menace ,  which demands the impossible :  a policeman on every corner .  In nightly theatrical TV rituals of social order and chaos , a stream of hero - policemen stand at the symbolic crossroads between peace and mayhem , and the detective and the chief officer now <head>operate</head> at the point where once the church and its priests declaimed on categories of good and evil and the resulting binary codes they produce . Inevitably ,  as a secular interpretation of morality has superseded that of established religion ,  so the  activities of the social controller have become increasingly important in the drama .  It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have remained the province of the archbishop and his clergy .

It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have remained the province of the archbishop and his clergy .  The immediate result is that alongside a few major clerics such as Runcie and Jenkins ,  we find that Stalker ,  Sampson ,  Anderton ,  Alderson ,  Newman ,  Imbert ,  Dear ,  Oxford ,  and Hermon are national personalities ,  while a second division of chief officers regularly proclaim on a range of subjects which at other times would lie outside the province of the police .  Yet Robert Reiner ( 1989 ) , writing on the collective culture of chief constables , is the first to explore their extraordinary place in modern society , simply because as an lite among the powerful in society they have had little need to reveal how they <head>operate</head> , link together , or reveal what structures of significance guide their actions . Across the history of policing their need has always been for the light of research to illuminate the activities of the underprivileged and the powerless ,  rather than focus upon the lite themselves !  Analysis of police culture is therefore particularly suited to the anthropological method ,  for it requires an extended field study to reveal much about the unspoken agenda which determines many aspects of police practice .

It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force  police service which remains unresolved ,  on which I will say more later in relation to the role of women police officers .  The dark uniform we wore had a military cap with polished brim ,  and in our fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boots we presented an avenging image ,  clothed in the symbolic colour of death and darkness .  Black is a light absorbent , non - reflective colour and most suitable for controllers who <head>operate</head> with a degree of social anonymity , upholding the rule of law and the abstractions of the legal system . In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .  As Reiner  ( 1980 )  suggested ,  the riot gear in which the police are increasingly seen ,  with shields ,  visored helmets ,  knee - length boots ,  and flame - proof overalls ,  enhances their avenging appearance .

For analytic purposes ,  these can be cast into a binary model ,  suggesting positive and negative polarities of :   Such spatial and temporal fixations are also deliberately elaborated in other institutions of control ,  such as the armed forces .  There we find similar bodily constructs built up as series of organizing principles , so that the other regiment or unit is perceived to <head>operate</head> in some kind of polluted time and space , and its aberrant nuances of uniform styling used as a marker of significant difference . The police also use concepts of a disciplined body in their dealings to effect the capture of the local villains  ( or prigs )  .  In any public confrontation a quick assessment and early resolution is the order of the day ,  for on the streets pragmatism always rules and real polises set out immediately to fix their adversaries by using deeply imbued constructs relating to time and space .

Few former colleagues had much idea of what anthropology was and many seemed never to even have heard the word .

Its practitioners <head>operate</head> in a world constrained by a belief in the immediate implementation of the legal precept , in which it becomes axiomatic that even the academic/criminologist will remain outside the world of praxis . For criminologists surely can never be successfully involved at the sharp end ,  or pointy end ,  dealing with angry men on the cold ,  hard streets  ( from fieldnotes )  .

First ,  there is the dualist 's  argument that mental processes cannot be physical processes because physical entities  such as neurons  -  lack certain qualities  such as intentionality or consciousness  that characterize the mental .  The response to this is that intentionality and consciousness are emergent properties  of physical systems .  Neurons do not individually have the property of consciousness , consciousness emerges when a large number of neurons are interacting in the right kind of way ; just as speed is a property not of any single component of a car , but an emergent property of the whole system when it is <head>operating</head> in an appropriate way . Of course ,  nobody as yet knows how intentionality  the property that mental phenomena have of being about  something other than themselves  or consciousness emerge from the operations of the brain .  From the perspective of functionalism  ( and from the perspective of other materialist theories also )  ,  however ,  this is a question for science rather than an imponderable problem of metaphysics .
