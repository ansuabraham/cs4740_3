For neurophysiologists and neuropsychologists ,  the way forward in understanding perception has been to correlate these dimensions of experience with ,  firstly ,  the material properties of the experienced object or event  ( usually regarded as the stimulus )  and ,  secondly ,  the patterns of discharges in the sensory system .  Qualitative Aspects of Experience The quality or modality of the experience depends less upon the quality of energy reaching the nervous system than upon which parts of the sensory system are <head>activated</head> : stimulation of the retinal receptors causes an experience of light ; stimulation of the receptors in the inner ear gives rise to the experience of sound ; and so on . Muller 's  nineteenth - century  doctrine of specific energies  formalized the ordinary observation that different sense organs are sensitive to different physical properties of the world and that when they are stimulated ,  sensations specific to those organs are experienced .  It was proposed that there are endings  ( or receptors )  within the nervous system which are attuned to specific types of energy ,  For example ,  retinal receptors in the eye respond to light energy ,  cochlear endings in the ear to vibrations in the air ,  and so on .

These choreographic sentences ,  no matter how short or long ,  broad or narrow ,  high or low must make sense within the total pattern or movement traced on the stage .  This pattern is made not only by the dancers '  feet as they move over the surface but also by the dancers '  bodies as they move through space .  Their limbs , torsos and heads can make straight , angled or rounded lines , usually at one and the same time , according to the natural structure of the dancers ' bones and how they are <head>activated</head> by the muscles . The choreographer must learn the natural functioning of the dancers '  bodies in order to combine steps and poses in a way that gives quality to the whole .  If the dance design is to have physical ,  musical and ,  when necessary ,  dramatic sense ,  would - be choreographers should study how and why Petipa divided his steps into seven categories and then study some examples of how other choreographers have used his ideas .

Can body cells be the seat of a human cyclotron effect ?  The cyclotron needs a magnetic field and a transverse AC electric field to pump energy into ions in motion in that field .  There are ions <head>activated</head> by thermal motion in blood and these are always subject to the Earth 's magnetic field . Proximity to a weak 50Hz or 60Hz electric field therefore means that ions in a certain mass range can respond to cyclotron action .  The ions in water and blood happen to be in the critical mass range .

The central question in terms of the diagram used in Fig. 5.11 ( a )   ( see also Fig. 5.10 )  is why experience of A and B should reduce the effectiveness of the c  elements in producing generalization between these stimuli .  The critical aspect of differentiation theory in this context is its assertion that exposure to A and B will lead to an increase in the number of distinctive features that can be detected .  This must mean , in terms of the figure , an increase in the number of a and b elements <head>activated</head> by the stimuli , something that can be represented diagrammatically in more than one way . Figure 5.11 ( b )  shows an increase in the areas a  and b  with a consequent reduction in the proportion  ( although not the absolute number )  of c  elements activated by a stimulus .  figure 5.11 ( c )  presents a slightly different possibility in which the sizes of  the A and B circles have not been changed .

* Comparing the scheme shown in fig. 5.11 ( b )  with that of Fig. 5.11 ( a )  ,  we might expect that the presence of the extra active a  elements would produce more effective overshadowing of the c  elements during training with A. Generalization to B would therefore be reduced .  Generalization would also be reduced given the scheme shown in fig. 5.11 ( c )  .  There would again be an increase in the ability of a elements to overshadow c elements , but in addition the reduction of the number of c elements <head>activated</head> by A would mean that relatively few of them would be capable of acquiring associative strength in the first place . Evaluation of the theories The interpretations of acquired distinctiveness/equivalence effects offered by mediation theory and differentiation theory differ markedly on two  ( related )  issues .

But what commits the muscle to this final pathway and what ensures that all the necessary genes are turned on at the same time ?  In the case of muscle it seems that there is a master gene controlling the expression of all the main genes ,  known as myogenin and it is always switched on in mature muscle cells .  Its special property is that it can <head>activate</head> most of the genes that are required in the mature muscle . The myogenin gene has been isolated and can be introduced into non - muscle cells where it becomes integrated into their DNA .  The effect of introducing just this one gene is to switch off some genes and to set in train a sequence of gene activation so that the cell develops into a muscle cell with all the appropriate proteins  master gene is an appropriate description .

Thromboxane A 2  is a more powerful pro - aggregatory substance in platelets than the endoperoxides ,  and it has been proposed that it is the arachidonic acid metabolite that mediates platelet aggregation and the release reaction  ( Hamberg et al ,  1975 )  .  Whether platelet endo - peroxides have a proaggregatory role in their own right or only when converted to thromboxane A 2  has been the subject of many studies  ( Bunting et al ,  1983 )  .  However , from experiments using thromboxane synthetase inhibitors it appears that when platelets are <head>activated</head> and the prostaglandin cascade is triggered by release of endogenous arachidonic acid then the endoperoxides generated exert their proaggregatory effects by their conversion to the more potent compound thromboxane A 2 . However ,  when the thromboxane generation is suppressed it is probable that endoperoxides can be proaggregatory themselves  ( Bunting et al ,  1983 )  .  It has been proposed that endoperoxides and thromboxane A 2  activate platelets by acting as calcium ionophores ,  hence mobilising intracellular free calcium  ( Gerrard et al ,  1978 )  .

Formal education extends this process by providing guidance into different ways of conceiving of the world and different ways of conveying these concepts in modes of description ,  argument ,  and so on .  Particular subjects on the curriculum can be seen as different sub - cultures in which reality is variously reformulated .  But if it is the case that language learning is activated by the socio - cultural purpose of schematic extension , that we learn language in order to get a better grasp of the world so that we can turn it to our advantage , then it would seem to follow that a central problem in the teaching of a foreign language lies in the provision of some comparable <head>activating</head> purpose . In other words ,  we need to identify areas of schematic knowledge which the learners will accept as independently relevant and worth acquiring so that the learning of the language is seen as the necessary means to a desired end .  If this is so ,  the first question to be asked in designing a language course should not be What language do we need to teach ?  but rather What do we need to teach that will stimulate the learning of language ?

Rightly or wrongly ,  the investing public ,  and others ,  do not see going concern qualifications as purely objective assessments of the distribution of future cash flows designed to aid investors in their portfolio choice .  They see them as having wider connotations ,  which may include casting doubt on both management competence and the financial statements '  integrity .  For these reasons , client managements are unlikely to welcome a going concern qualification , and their concerns may well be reinforced if such a qualification restricts management freedom of action , possibly by allowing debt covenants to be <head>activated</head> , restricting the freedom to pay dividends , and so on . It may well be that risk - taking companies are managed by risk - taking individuals with powerful personalities .

It would certainly be naive just to assume that nerve cells are the same in molluscs as in people ,  but fortunately it is possible to rely on more than assumption .  The advantage of this sort of work is that the descriptions of cellular mechanisms are very detailed and this provides a good basis for determining whether the same cellular mechanisms are available in mammals .  For example , plasticity seems to depend on identifiable ion channels and catalytic molecules that <head>activate</head> or inhibit these channels . It is possible to use advanced biochemical techniques to look for comparable ion channels and catalytic units in the mammalian brain ,  without directly studying the role of cells in learning .  The problem with this approach is that it does n't allow for the possibility that there are additional cellular mechanisms of plasticity in mammals ,  that have evolved to underpin our greater learning abilities .

Our sense organs are not passive relays ,  but encode the constantly fluctuating patterns of stimulation impinging on the receptors into fluctuating patterns of neural activity .  These patterns are related to the patterns of input but already selective recoding has begun ,  since some aspects of the input will activate the nervous system more than others .  For example , edges tend to <head>activate</head> the visual system more than areas of uniform brightness . Changes of pressure across the fingertips produce much more intense input from touch receptors than steady pressure .  You can verify that for yourself by running your fingertips ova a slightly rough surface and then stopping .

Long - term potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is the primary experimental model for investigating the synaptic basis of learning and memory in vertebrates .  The best understood form of long - term potentiation is induced by the activation of the  receptor complex .  This subtype of glutamate receptor endows long - term potentiation with Hebbian characteristics , and allows electrical events at the postsynaptic membrane to be transduced into chemical signals which , in turn , are thought to <head>activate</head> both pre - and postsynaptic mechanisms to generate a persistent increase in synaptic strength . THE assumption that information is stored in the brain as changes in synaptic efficiency emerged about a century ago following the demonstration by Cajal that networks of neurons are not in cytoplasmic continuity but communicate with each other at the specialized junctions which Sherrington called synapses .  External events are represented in the brain as spatio - temporal patterns of neural activity ,  and it is these patterns of activity which must themselves be the agents of synaptic change .

The family slave boy ,  Metty  ( the name means half - caste )  ,  who had come to live with him ,  is firmly left behind .

This feeling is <head>added</head> to a previous illumination , to a stoicism which believes in the unity of experience and the illusion of pain ' Salim tells Salim 's  story .  It is not Naipaul 's  ;  it does not constitute the author 's  testament or confession on the subject of race relations and the rest of it .

There is a vital difference between real ale and keg beer .  Keg ,  which includes lager ,  is known in the industry as brewery conditioned beer .  Instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to <head>add</head> a full , mature palate , keg beers are killed off in the brewery by a number of unnatural processes that affect the taste and quality of the product . The aim is to produce beers quickly which ,  because they are sterile and have a long shelf life ,  are also highly profitable .  Where keg milds and bitters are concerned ,  when fermentation is complete they are conditioned for a short period in tanks under a heavy blanket of carbon dioxide .

Perhaps the glider is theoretically just within range for a straight glide home ,  but has very little extra height in hand and not much prospect of getting another climb .

A sudden change of aulement  ,  an unusual turn in - out of legs or arms ,  or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design .  Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton 's  five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros  and Consort Lessons  .  In fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift changes <head>add</head> a touch of humour as two or more dancers compete to capture the attention of both the audience and their Colleagues .

Different manufacturers claim widely different life expectancies for both materials ,  but you can reasonably expect a five - year life from most types  ( but as some manufacturers claim a life of only half this ,  and others double ,  check before you buy )  .  The majority of bird netting is likely to be knotted  ( this produces a fine and very flexible net )  or knitted ,  but the thickness of the thread is likely to be more important than the type of assembly .

Corrosion in central heating systems is a major problem and can result in a build - up of sludge ,  the main symptom of which is cold areas at the bottom of the radiators .

Corrosion can be avoided in central heating systems if an inhibitor is <head>added</head> to the feed - and expansion cistern .

The result is a townscape of terrible despairing cries which mean ,  and mean more than ,  that the drunks are leaving the pubs between two and three o'clock in the morning ,  the pubs that reek of alcohol and cucumber and fish .  A townscape of nightmare yellows :  sky ,  buildings ,  furniture ,  wallpaper ,  faces  the colour of age ,  heat ,  pestilence ,  bile and jaundice ,  bruisings and stainings ,  with a stronger connotation of dirt in Russian than in English ;  the colour of the tickets of identification which prostitutes were required to carry ;  the colour of Raskolnikov 's  cubbyhole of a room ;  and the colour which greets him when he comes to after fainting at the police station and sees a man holding a yellow glass filled with yellow water .  Looking over Dostoevsky 's shoulder , we find him first writing small yellow glass , then deleting small ; and writing water then <head>adding</head> yellow warm to the water , then deleting warm the final text uniting an apocalyptic starkness of yellow meets yellow with the topicality of Petersburg 's notoriously filthy water supply , a subject of much comment and complaint in the newspapers . At such moments we come  as close as it is possible to get to the spirit of Crime and Punishment  .  Having ,  as I say ,  abandoned everything he had done ,  he sat down and wrote a six - part novel within a year which included a twenty - six day break in which he threw together and dictated The Gambler  ,  itself not a small book nor a negligible one ,  to satisfy the terms of a contract he had made with a shyster publisher .

Compare Dostoevsky 's  attempt ,  frustrated by the good angel of his genius ,  to explain Raskolnikov 's  motive for his crime .  In the novel itself ,  where we might expect Marmeladov to speak of solace ,  respite ,  forgetting ,  companionship ,  he grasps the paradox that he drinks because he is in search of suffering ,  of tears and tribulation .  And , he <head>adds</head> , I have found them . This has the same free ,  metaphysical bearing on his being a drunkard that Raskolnikov 's  wanting to dare has on his being a murderer .  Moreover ,  as always in Dostoevsky ,  the search for suffering refuses to settle into coherent masochistic focus .

The one is the passive and the other the active form of a single human truth ,  as Dostoevsky sees it and realizes it fictionally .  The singleness of this truth is what I called the marriage of the Drunks  project and the Confession project in Crime and Punishment  .  The novelist is now of course in middle age , but right back in his teens he wrote to his brother Man is a mystery , <head>adding</head> that a lifetime spent trying to unravel the mystery would not be wasted .

So delicately modulated are the forms of the head that the human element <head>appears</head> ephemeral . This tenuous fragility contrasts with the three later busts on a stele ,  which have substantial anatomical forms .  The sculptor had decided that he wanted this bust to confront the observer .

These examples of catalogues containing helpful art criticism could be contrasted with many others which are limited to lists of exhibitions ,  details of the artist 's  career ,  and entries for the works displayed .  There are other hazards for the readers of catalogues .  Some publications are less impartial than they might <head>appear</head> , erring on the side of generosity . Museums with exhibitions of art from other countries are especially likely to be respectful in commentaries on works of art which have been borrowed .

However , that myth is not quite the one which <head>appears</head> to have penetrated everyday life , perhaps because the place of the victory is located within the borders of the Southern state .

While preparing an early draft of the present chapter ,  the writer heard Bishop Cathal Daly of Down and Connor ,  a leading moderate among the bishops ,  respected by all except PIRA ,  repeat the adage that the Irish constitution was secular ,  implying that there really was little to be done for the moment .  This in fact was the main tack in the bishops '  attitude to the forum .  There <head>appears</head> to have been a general feeling among them that there was no real problem on this score . Concessions would only be required once a united Ireland was being negotiated  ( New Ireland Forum 19834 :  xii .  11 )  .

But where other churches have owned their own schools ,  as does the Church of Ireland in the South ,  a similar position has been adopted ,  though the reasons for the position have been on different grounds .  A proposal before the Church of Ireland synod in May 1979 to support interdenominational education was defeated ,  despite pressure from its ecumenical lobby .  The main grounds <head>appeared</head> to be the danger which it might pose to the small Southern protestant minority by encouraging mixed marriages . However ,  no evidence favouring such a contention has ever been produced .  Harry MacAdoo ,  then the Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin ,  on several occasions put forward the argument that Southern protestants were a minority group with their own culture and traditions ,  and thus deserved to have schools for themselves in order to hand on their own traditions .

Goldberg taking out his polka - dotted handkerchief and wiping his brow ,  his cheeks ,  his neck ,  pushed aside the typewriter and seized his pen .  Dragging the pad towards him he found a clean page and wrote :  Dear Harsnet ,  I know you never answer my letters or return my calls ,  and I know that you handed over your notes to me on the understanding that I could do what I liked with them and not bother you ,  but I have to say that while there is much in them that I admire ,  as I will always admire much in you ,  no matter what ,  there is also much in them that seems to me to be puerile and ,  to put it mildly ,  bigoted .

RUTH WATSON Fox and Goose ,  Fressingfield ,  Near Diss ,  Norfolk .   LEISURE DESIGN IS IMPORTANT WHY is it that hotel owners and operators put so much emphasis on recruiting professional hotel designers to create the right hotel , but , when it comes to the inclusion of leisure facilities , then they <head>appear</head> to approach any designer , with the impression that it can be addressed from a design viewpoint just like any other area ? In fact the leisure facility is a minefield of safety ,  legal ,  and operational problems that ,  unless addressed in a professional manner ,  can cause catastrophic consequences .  It is often said that the two most difficult and specialist design areas within a hotel are the kitchen and the leisure facility .

It is a matter of their input systems being tuned to the contours of this physical and this social reality .

A recent DSS Housing Benefit/Community Charge Benefit circular has given guidance about the treatment of income which is paid at intervals other than one week .  Where income such as an occupational pension or Retirement Pension is paid into a bank or building society account on ,  for example ,  a monthly or four - weekly basis ,  in some cases this has been treated as capital resulting in a possible reduction of benefit .  In effect it <head>appears</head> that the pension has been assessed both as income and capital . The circular states that income to cover a certain period should be ignored as capital for that period .  For example if a person who has 3,000 capital receives a monthly pension of 200 paid into their bank account ,  this should not be assessed as an increase in savings unless it remains unspent at the time the next payment is due .

But the working papers state that the list in the White Paper is not definitive ,  and that DHAs will be able to decide what core services are appropriate for them to maintain .   Working Paper 2 states :   even where a service is regarded as one which must be provided locally ,  it does not follow that every patient must have that treatment locally ,  it does not follow that every patient must have that treatment locally ,  if the patient and the GP or DHA as purchaser believe it to be better for them to be treated elsewhere .  This <head>appears</head> to make the concept of locally - available core services a rather uncertain one . As time goes on ,  the Government envisages more and more hospitals becoming NHS Trusts ,  with powers to negotiate what services they will provide .  Working Paper 1 states that many core services are currently provided by hospitals likely to seek self - governing status ,  and the Secretary of State ,  in first establishing an NHS Hospital Trust ,  will approve the arrangements for providing core services .

But this was only innovative in so far as classical ballet was concerned as there are many 5/4 Slav folk dances .  Ashton makes brilliant use of this in his version of the solo ,  phrasing the steps so that a jump upwards can last three beats followed by two short steps or two beats followed by a long and then a short step .  Taking time in the air makes leaps <head>appear</head> higher and more sustained than is usual . Music should ,  however ,  not be used merely as a time - keeper as the above remarks may suggest .  Choreographers should understand that counting beats or what is called the measure of the music is not dance rhythm .

That is ,  the choreographer must understand from which part of the body impetus is to be given so that the step achieves its full purpose at the proper moment  usually in some gesture and its musical emphasis .  The moment can be as the dancer pauses momentarily in a pose ,  as a comma in the middle or as a full stop at the end of a sentence .  Or the moment can be an important point in an overall design to fill space , such as the moment in a grand jet en avant when the dancer 's two legs are at an equal height from the ground and he or she <head>appears</head> to travel onwards effortlessly through space . It can also be the moment when a dancer moves into a pirouette  and spins before holding a pose .  However ,  more important is the third meaning of impetus which has also to do with physical performance .

Anyone using steel backs to their shoes can still do this .  There is no light and shade and this way of using the pointes  has nothing to do with giving a finishing touch to such dances as those fur Petipa 's  Aurora and the Six Fairies in The Sleeping Beauty  to make them seem lighter than air .  Nor does it resemble the bravura footing of Kitri in the Don Quixote pas de deux or the passages in Ashton 's Ondine where his ballerina <head>appears</head> to be floating through water . Nor can it be compared with the ballerina 's  dance in Rhapsodie  where she wafts to and fro as if in a dream before breaking into her solo .  The spacing of such steps on pointe  is so minute and so fast that it is not possible to see the change of feet as one succeeds the other.

Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the whole affair is the way Dr Browne handled it .  The members of his party appeared to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the earlier Bill ,  and Dr Browne only found out in October/November 1950 .

In fact ,  his cabinet colleagues ,  already unsure about public support for the bill and alienated from Dr Browne by his provocative politics ,  were not prepared to go against the hierarchy 's  condemnation and refused to support the proposal .

Traditionally in anthropology ,  the ethnographer has studied a social system or culture through a period of intensive participant observation in the field .  This has generated considerable concern about the ethnographic experience itself ,  and specifically about the subjective nature of the process .  Unlike the natural sciences , where discussion often starts with the results and ignores the methodology of the research , the social sciences and increasingly anthropology have developed an elaborate <head>argument</head> about the practices of doing research . The interpretation of culture and even the ability to understand what is happening in the society under scrutiny as well as the need to grapple with political or ethical questions are all endless and fundamental problems of the moment  ( Phillips 1973 :  78 )  .  Mere observation and reporting is inadequate ,  given the limited scope of things which can be truly observed  ( Holy 1984 :  25 )  .

Since these states of affairs are of the essence of human perceptual consciousness and ,  therefore ,  of the human mind ,  it must follow that there are non - physical states of affairs essential to the human mind .  So a materialist theory of the mind is false .  The most primitive physicalist response to this <head>argument</head> is to deny the claim that there is anything about the mind that BS does not know . All that BS lacks is an ability to respond directly to stimuli of certain sorts :  V knows no more than BS ,  he can simply do something BS cannot .  BS is like a man who knows all about swimming ,  even to the point of being able to train the Olympic team ,  but who cannot swim himself ,  and V is the man with the normal talent for swimming .

In showing that cognition as a whole cannot be treated behaviouristically ,  I have not thereby shown that a behaviouristic treatment of sense - experience is false .  So perhaps my overkill misses the target :  perhaps the behaviourist analysis of perception is sound ,  even though a general behaviourism is not ,  and what BS lacks is not knowledge of the nature of certain mental states ,  but only the ability to respond spontaneously to visual stimuli ,  that is ,  to respond as a result of actually seeing them .  Reflection on the nature of the <head>argument</head> against behaviourism in general , however , reveals that the <head>argument</head> refutes the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular . That argument showed that knowledge of the external world cannot be reduced to behavioural dispositions ,  for the very idea of a disposition functions only in the context of an unreduced grasp on the physical world .  But there is nowhere else that we might get our conception of the physical world from ,  other than perception .

Constructivism and development The constructivist theory of mind regards thinking on an analogy with action ;  just as the representation theory takes an analogy with drawing and writing .  Moreover , to the same extent that the representational theory is non - developmental ( recall the Fodor 's <head>argument</head> against learning ) , the constructivist theory is developmental . I would not say that the developmental view is a consequence of the thoughtaction analogy exactly ,  because there could be constructivist theories that do not mention development .  It is certain ,  though ,  that the constructivism that has received the most attention in psychology and philosophy has been the developmental theory of Jean Piaget .

Furthermore ,  the work of Young and his colleagues ,  which I shall be discussing later in the chapter ,  shows that being aware of the operations of ,  say ,  one 's  face processing system has vitally important functional consequences .  However ,  the functionalist view is that it would be quite misguided to attempt to explain behaviour by making direct reference to the subjective  or phenomenal  qualities  ( technically known as qualia  )  of these mental states .  If it is really necessary to think of mental states as having qualitative content ( and see Dennett , 1988 , for some powerful <head>arguments</head> that it is not ) , then it follows from functionalism that such qualia do not have causal interactions with other mental states or behaviour and are mere epiphenomena . Successful Science The sceptic might ,  at this point ,  complain that while I may have sketched out the functionalist position ,  I have not provided any convincing arguments as to why one should believe it .

Today there is again a global capital market ,  but no gold standard ,  no fixed exchange rates ,  for Britain not even a European Monetary System .  That is not Mr Lawson 's  fault ,  of course ,  but he has to live with the danger that while the world 's  capital markets will duly bridge the gap between Britain 's  domestic savings and investment ,  they will only do so at a lower price for sterling .  If you take the <head>argument</head> about consenting adults to its logical conclusion , that price Britain 's exchange rate should be left to them , too . But however suspicious Mrs Thatcher may be of managed exchange rate systems ,  she dislikes a falling pound as much as anyone .  So we come back around the circle to the capital side of the balance of payments ,  and the operationally interesting question :  for how long can we expect the world 's  savers to make up our domestic shortage ?

The Blackpool meeting was the first between Mr Savimbi and a British minister ,  underlining the importance Britain attaches to persuading Mr Savimbi to return to the conference table .  The Unita leader indicated that he was ready to do so ,  and suggested a meeting in Libreville within the next month .  Mr Savimbi is meeting President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire in Paris on Monday , and yesterday the Angolan Foreign Minister , Pedro de Castro van Dunem , hurried there to put his side of the <head>argument</head> to the Zairean mediator . Officials say it is because the two sides have different versions of what was decided at the previous negotiations that the ceasefire has broken down. Angola wants Mr Savimbi to go into voluntary exile while elections are held ,  perhaps to return later ,  but his supporters say there was no such agreement .

The revival of the campaign for Scottish devolution  indeed ,  for Scottish nationalism ,  as shown in Jim Sillars '  by - election victory in Govan  was a notable feature of the later phase of Mrs Thatcher 's  regime .  Here and elsewhere ,  the government strove to identify itself with new themes .  In particular , the green <head>argument</head> advanced by environmentalists , fanned by the importance of themes such as land conservation , acid rain , and the protection of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect in the 1989 Euro - elections , suggested that the message of Thatcherite consumption and wealth creation failed to mesh with wider concerns for the quality of life . The rise of green issues ,  indeed ,  was more naturally appealing to Labour or Alliance politicians ,  and a powerful reminder of the rich variety of resistance to Thatcherism that British society could release .  It led to Nicholas Ridley 's  removal from the Environment department in July 1989 ,  in favour of the notoriously wet Chris Patten .

Michael 's  problem was that he saw the glamour in Frank 's  position :  the love of liberty ;  the excitement in the free pursuit of truth ;  the shaking off of convention and mere conformity ;  the feeling that religion was a stuffy valley out of which he had grown .  He also had to recognize that his brother was an unselfish person ;  so that the axiom ,  only religious people are unselfish did not wash .  The <head>argument</head> was a fire in which to test an immature faith . A school prize was offered for a study of the book Belief in God  by Bishop Charles Gore .

He  dedicated this formidable intellect to eradicating nonsense from the world ,  especially nonsense in divinity ,  which was a world where in those days he could find plenty of targets for his scorn .  And in the faculty he was surrounded by several men of substance with much the same opinions though with less hardness in their advocacy .  Since most Christian teachers are kind persons who prefer to avoid controversy when they can , and doodle anxiously during fierce <head>argument</head> at meetings , things tended to go the way of Bethune - Baker ; partly because he was devastating , and partly because often he was devastatingly right . To be of Anglo - Catholic opinions in this group was to be a man apart .  Bethune - Baker regarded Anglo - Catholicism as part of the nonsense which it was his mission to destroy .

The Plowden Report on Control of Public Expenditure  contained ,  amongst other nuggets of wisdom ,  the following sentence which I should like to take as my starting - point :  The social changes of the last fifteen years have altered the incidence of hardship ,  so that there now may well be excessive social services for some purposes and inadequate ones for others .  I should have thought that ,  in the abstract ,  no one was likely to quarrel with that statement .

Mrs Thatcher has a clear view of her role as Prime Minister and sees herself as an activist rather than an arbitrator in Cabinet disputes or a spokesman for a collective Cabinet view .

As Prime Minister I could not waste time having any internal <head>arguments</head> or Yes , I do drive through things which I believe in passionately what else do you expect of a Prime Minister ?

Despite the <head>arguments</head> in favour of the course which the King adopted , his encouragement to MacDonald to hold the government together and to fight the election as a government had quite momentous consequences for the politics of the 1930s . Although the King 's  intentions were not partisan ,  the consequences were such as to offer very considerable benefit to the Conservative party .  The 1931 general election gave the Conservatives a huge overall majority in the House of Commons ,  enabling them to pursue their tariff policy with little hindrance .

Since this condemnation of research opportunity ,  few studies have penetrated deeply beneath the sensitive skin of police culture ,  and even though Chatterton in his notes to my thesis argued there has been a considerable amount of participant police research ,  I would question whether many of these inquiries achieved the finer grain and detail ' of the insider 's  account ,  for they can never really know or tell if they have been excluded from the inner workings of police practice or prevented from gaining access to the hidden realities contained inside the heads of the constables .  Because of the litism which such an organization of control wields ,  it is not surprising there is difficulty in incorporating the outside researcher ,  or in accepting his critical findings .  And certainly that other main <head>arm</head> of executive control the army seems little better at this than the police , for the number of participant accounts of their deep structures remains negligible , supporting McCabe 's ( 1980 ) contention that we should be asking of all of these costly institutions , who is to be controlled by whom and for what reasons ? Meanwhile ,  as Reiner  ( 1985 )  suggests ,  the politicization of the police has proceeded at a pace ,  and can be illustrated by their growing willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy .  This trend is further displayed in their growing tendency to agree to be used as a pseudo - military arm of government in its socio - economic and industrial/political disputes with whole sections of society .

If he extends his <head>arms</head> with the fingers together it is an award . Finally ,  if the referee brings both fists together in the middle of the chest ,  this means that both contestants scored at the same time ,  so no awards will be made .

As well as dealing with the punch ,  the rising block travels diagonally up and forwards into the opponent ,  catching him high on the attacking arm .  Do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring your chin close to the opponent 's  other fist .  There is no need to withdraw your blocking <head>arm</head> fully as you reverse punch ; you probably wo n't have enough time to anyway ! The main thing is to shift your centre of gravity forwards behind the punch ,  so that it is delivered with plenty of power .  Simply rock forwards on to your leading knee to achieve this .

Even if the slide is not feasible ,  you can still throw your centre of gravity forward ,  so that weight increases on the leading leg .  The fifth attention - grabber is the exaggerated hip action which should accompany every punch .  This shows that the punch is not merely an <head>arm</head> movement , but a powerful , co - ordinated body action . The punching hip ,  be it the leading hip of a front punch or the trailing hip of a reverse punch ,  must swivel forwards ,  so that your centre - line directly faces the opponent .  You may well decide to twist even further when using the front punch ,  but beware that your situation is weakened should the opponent immediately counter  attack .

The back fist This punch is not a linear strike like the previous two but a circular one .  The back fist unrolls from the shoulder , propelled as much by the body turning away as by the <head>arm</head> action itself . Many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the arm action .  A back fist will out - range a reverse punch performed by an opponent of equal height but it is not often scored because many referees do not consider it powerful enough .

Lean in behind the strike in order to get the maximum range ,  and raise your other hand as a guard .  Unfortunately ,  the cocking action that begins a back fist movement presents an unmistakable cue to the opponent .  The punching elbow must be flexed before it can be extended fully , and any attempt to strike with a semi - extended <head>arm</head> is sure to fail because of the obvious weakness of the technique . The question is ,  how do you disguise the elbow flexion ?  One answer is to open with a reverse punch to the mid - section .

Do not arch the back during the exercise ,  and do not swing the dumb - bells .  Barbell curl Stand upright with the <head>arms</head> straight down , holding the barbell with the hands shoulder width apart and the palms facing outwards . Slowly curl the barbell to shoulder height ,  and then lower it slowly to the starting position .  Do not lean backwards or jerk the barbell upwards as this will put great strain on the lower back area and detract from the development of the biceps .

The pectoralis minor lies underneath the pectoralis major and in almost all cases any reference to the pecs means the pectoralis major .  The pecs respond fairly quickly regular training ,  especially the bench press .  The main function of pecs is to adduct the <head>arms</head> ( adduction is a movement towards the centre - line of the body ) , that is they move the upper <head>arms</head> across the body as in dumb - bell flyes . Other movements brought about by the pecs are shoulder flexion ,  which draws the arm forwards and upwards ,  and shoulder extension ,  which draws the arm down and forwards .  By working the pecs from different angles it is possible to direct the work - load to different parts of the muscle .

After the legs ,  the back is the most neglected area in terms of training and development .  The reason for this is very simple  you ca n't see it .  An individual will get far more pleasure working his chest , his abdominals or his <head>arms</head> because he can see the muscles working and developing . Also ,  it is much harder to train the back muscles and receive a hard pump .  The back consists of 3 main sections ;  the lower ,  the middle and the upper back .

Dancers easily understand how a series of swift pas de bourre courus   ( i.e. running on the toes )  as danced by the Queen of the Wilis in Giselle  ,  differs from the same step performed piqu   ( i.e. each foot picked up sharply at each change of weight )  ,  as in many of petipa 's  solos .  But it is not always easy to decide which is the more appropriate ,  nor how the two ways mentioned can lead to other versions .  for example , in her solo in Ashton 's Cinderella the Winter Fairy moves across the stage in a series of pas de bourre en tournant terre , the feet weaving their in - and - out pattern as the <head>arms</head> flick to and fro sparkling with frost . In Symphonic  Variations  ,  the dancers perform pas de bourre piqus sur les pointes  very gently because they are marking the rhythmic beat as the soloist dances to the melodic phrase .  This is an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythms are explicitly brought to life by the dance design  ( see page 68 )  .

This is an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythms are explicitly brought to life by the dance design  ( see page 68 )  .  One of the most beautiful uses of pas de bourre courus is when Ashton places his danseuse in her partner 's <head>arms</head> as she floats over the surface of the floor as if in a dream like ecstasy . It is a movement he has used many times and which is perhaps seen at its best in the pas de deux  to the Meditation  from Thai - s  created for Anthony Dowell and Antoinette Sibley ;  in A Month in the Country  when Natalia dances with the Tutor to express her emotions ;  and in Les Deux Pigeons  in the final pas de deux  ,  when the Young Man has returned to The Girl and tenderly dances with her in his arms  ( see page 83 )  .  It was this ability to display a ballerina 's  apparent weightlessness and sheer joy in dance that was so impressive when the Spirits of the Air danced in Homage to the  Queen  ,  Ashton 's  exquisite celebration of the 1952 Coronation which was danced by Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes .

Dauberval 's  exclusion from the Acadmie Royale  ( later the Paris Opera )  was justified by those in charge because they felt his idea of making farmers ,  peasants and the like the heroes and heroines of his ballets was beneath the dignity of an opera house whose stage had hitherto been occupied with the deeds of noble heroes ,  heroines and courts .  Bournonville coloured his ballets with movements characteristic of many different personalities and nationalities .  In his particular style of demi - caractre dance he used classical footwork for most of the time but , from the waist upwards through the body , <head>arms</head> and head , he tried to convey how his performers worked and played in the environment to which they belonged . for example :  in Napoli  they were Italian ,  in Far from Denmark  they were Danes influenced by the dance of South America .  This way of creating more plebeian characters is fully demonstrated in Ashton 's  comic masterpiece La Fille Mal Garde  ,  where this style of dance is shown in two different aspects ,  the light - hearted yet technically highly expert dancing of Lise and Colas and the comically eccentric work of Alain and the Cock and Hens .

As traditional Italian dances are often sung ,  the performers pose solemnly fur a second or two at the end of each phrase .  This was a feature widely used by nineteenth - century Italian balletmasters and by Bournonville .  But the latter 's pause was often to hold the dancers in perfect 5th positions of both <head>arms</head> and feet .

Fokine 's  advice to those wishing to create the romantic style of dance was much as fur demi - caractre  when he said :  The choreographer should base his design on classical technique from the feet to the waist ,  but above that the dancer 's  head ,  body and arms must be free to express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the character in the story or theme to be communicated .  This style was first created by Taglioni for his daughter Marie .  The tale of La Sylphide gave him an opportunity to exploit her expressive <head>arms</head> and face as well as her ability to dance sur les pointes . Perrot developed the style in his dances fur Carlotta Grisi in Giselle  .  It was then expanded by Fokine and used in both grave and gay moods in Les Sylphides  and Le Carnaval  ,  where it is particularly expressive of both meaning and music .

If choreographers study the above works of Ashton and MacMillan ,  they will understand how far the art of choreography has developed since Fokine changed its structure and texture .  They will perhaps understand even better if they pay particular attention to the fine details of every movement .  It is no longer the case that the romantic style means dancing classically from the feet to the waist and above that allowing the body , <head>arms</head> and head to express themselves to describe the moods , emotions and actions of the characters . It is well known that only a great dancer - artist can suggest the development of the sixteen - year - old Aurora ,  happy at her birthday ,  into the dreamy figure the Prince meets in the woodland glade and on to her final entrance as a triumphant princess fully awake to her responsibilities as Queen - to - be .  The enchanements  she dances  thoughout  the three scenes do not change in style or content .

Juliet then becomes the slightly apprehensive debutante at the Ball where her movements ,  though tentative ,   are conventionally correct when she dances with Paris .  The moment she encounters Romeo and senses somehow that her life has changed her movement becomes more purposeful .  From there onwards it becomes stronger and more emotional so that her joyous movements and later abandon in Romeo 's <head>arms</head> are in absolute contrast to her later dance with Paris . Her movements then are equally purposeful but they are constricted and withdrawn ,  so that her father 's  contemptuous rejection of her pleas and his throwing her to the floor seem the proper outcome of what in his eyes is sheer disobedience .  It is her final passionate abandon on discovering Romeo 's  body that demonstrates how overwhelming sorrow can destroy all sense of discipline over both body and mind .

As a young doctor in Leiden he paid a seminal visit to the neuroanatomist WJH Nauta ,  at that time developing a revolutionary anatomical technique for investigating the nervous system by staining degenerating fibres cut off from their parent cell - bodies .  Kuypers was the first to use this technique in studies of the brain and over the next 10 years ,  now in the United States ,  he charted at a new level of detail the connections made by the cerebral cortex with nervous elements in the brain - stem and spinal cord that control movement in a number of higher mammals .  Kuypers then started a long series of collaborative studies in which injuries to some of these connections in the monkey 's brain were correlated with the defects they produced in performance of movements ; the poising of an <head>arm</head> , for instance , to carry out an operation with the fingers could be dissociated from the ability to use the fingers skilfully . These studies continued ,  with increasing sophistication ,  after his return to Europe in 1966 as Professor of Anatomy at the new Erasmus University in Rotterdam .  He showed that injury to connections within the cerebral cortex could cause the dissociation of hand movements guided by vision from those guided by touch .

No drama school panel is looking for the ultimate in audition technique but candidates  should possess a noticeable degree of competence and self - awareness .  Not all auditions have just two speeches ,  classical and modern .  You may well be <head>asked</head> to sing something unaccompanied , or do a short improvisation and you may well be <head>asked</head> to perform one of the speeches in a different way . In some schools you will be asked to participate with other students in basic class work over a weekend  ( as happens at the Bristol Old Vic drama school )  and in some you may find yourself being judged partly by senior students of the school who will be sitting with the faculty panel  ( which is something that happens at Drama Centre )  .  The point of preparation is to be well tuned and at the same time flexible to new interpretations and ideas .

Drama school productions are staged with an awareness of the kind of demands the profession will make ,  and students are naturally anxious to be seen in the final production by people who 're likely to offer them work .  Unfortunately ,  it is often difficult to get agents to attend these productions .  Most drama schools final productions are staged over a similar sort of schedule , which means agents are <head>asked</head> to see students ' work over a fairly compressed period . Agents are notified of performances by the schools ,  and they also receive hundreds of letters from students inviting them to see particular performances .  Remember ,  though ,  that badgering agents is quite useless ;  if they want to come they will come ,  but telephoning them and overselling yourself can be just as useless as not letting them know that you 're alive and working .

We will see that this mode of constructing monopoly catholicism is alien to the Concordat period of Roman catholic church  state relations recognizable in arrangements ,  for example ,  with Spain ,  Portugal ,  and Italy .  A dislike by Irish clerics for such an explicit and direct church  state relationship has a long tradition and comes out best in De Tocqueville 's   ( 1957 )  conversations with Irish clergy on his visit to Ireland in 1834 .  When <head>asked</head> if they would like subventions from the state to aid their stipends and church buildings , a move which was being seriously considered by the British government at the time , priests and bishops were united in rejecting the idea on the grounds that it would drive a wedge between clergy and people , identifying clergy with the principal enemies of the people . De Tocqueville 's  notes reveal not only the conscious opposition to such a mode of religious power but also how deep the solidarity between clergy and people was ,  the degree to which the poor ,  half the catholic population at the time ,  looked to the clergy for material and spiritual leadership ,  guidance ,  and assistance ,  and how much they trusted them .  However ,  with the emergence of the Southern Irish state ,  it soon became clear that this secularization of the state form was not to signify an absence of Roman catholic power in the construction of public morality ,  but rather an indirect recognition of the sovereignty of the church in most areas of moral concern besides education .

The British Standards Institute  ( BSI )  specifies a thickness of 30 microns for hotel use .

There are surprisingly few popular patterns of cutlery  most caterers use the historic patterns devised in Sheffield .  The fact that a wide number of manufacturers work to the same pattern means that the caterer who is topping up need not return to the same source for the top - up. Identify a selection of cutlery distributors , send them one of your pieces of cutlery and <head>ask</head> them to match it and send their sample and yours back . There will be some differences ,  but they may be too slight to be noticed by the customers ,  who would normally see only one piece of each item in any case .  Shopping around for a top - up will allow the best price while still keeping the cutlery service in the same style .

Statistically these deaths largely occur as a result of the inhalation of vomit and alcoholic poisoning ,  and it therefore seems somewhat bizarre for the police to be in charge of those suffering in such a way .  More often than not the victims have serious medical problems ,  show a long history of social inadequacy ,  or are clearly suffering from mental illness .  At the 1987 annual ACPO conference , chief officers complained they were still having to deal with this illness and <head>asked</head> why do people still need to die in cells from inhalation of vomit ? In Chapter 3 I will describe in detail the culture created to deal with these street - visible offenders in a cell - block situation ,  but suggest the inertia surrounding the whole problem is more easily understood when we consider the social history of such illness  ( Foucault 1967 )  ,  and see how the executive has always allocated the control of such drunken dossers to the police .  As social dirt they become an affront to purity and possess the danger of the contagious and impure  ( Douglas 1966 )  ,  requiring their removal from the public vision .

I had applied to continue full - time research following my degree course ,  but this had been turned down by my chief officers ;  however ,  I had been told that assistance for part - time study would almost certainly be approved in view of the national policy of encouraging officers to extend their educational qualifications .  I then found my application for financial assistance for part - time study had been rejected because anthropology is not on the approved list of subjects  ( in the Circular )   ( Memo from HQ 1977 )  .  Eventually I was able to convince my senior officers that anthropology was one of the social sciences , perhaps only because I somewhat sardonically returned a memo which <head>asked</head> why , if anthropology is not approved , have I just been allowed to read the subject on a Bramshill Scholarship , on full pay and allowances ?

Young Angus thought ,  You were a coward  no you were not  what else could you have done ?  He grew up that day ,  and never again saw his father as a being who could do anything and was never at a loss .  His mother looked nervously at them as they came in long after dark she was obdurately against the recalling of the bad old times and she would neither <head>ask</head> them what they had seen nor let them tell her . It had been his first and only history lesson ,  and throughout their hungry and needy years in Bunarkaig he never lost the sense that they lived under threat ,  that government was pitiless ,  and that some day they would have to fight again for the right to live at peace in their own place .

Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage  the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the audience are vitally connected to what is going on .  As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself ,  and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for .  Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 , scene 1 of Henry V , which draws the audience into the <head>atmosphere</head> before a battle enormously effectively ) . It is also used as a dramatic device by many contemporary playwrights .   The film is a very distinct dramatic medium .

If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the characters they play .  This is what happens in MacMillan 's  Romeo and Juliet  and Ashton 's  A Month in the Country  .  It is perhaps appropriate to stress again that where playwrights require pages of dialogue to explain every factor in the development of the plot , to create a changing <head>atmosphere</head> and to show how the actions affect the actors in the play , dancers can communicate whole passages of dialogue in a few expressive gestures woven into enchanements . ( As played by the Moscow Arts Theatre ,  Turgenev 's  A Month in the  Country  takes over two hours ,  Ashton 's  ballet roughly half an hour .  )  Only characters and episodes essential to the plot are retained .

The dancing reflects the wartime <head>atmosphere</head> when shore leave was a cherished moment . Even though the boys and girls are figments of Robbins '  imagination ,  their brief encounter is based in reality even to the introduction of popular dance steps and stylistic elements current during the 193945 war .  Both the above - mentioned works show that ballets based on the life of real people require that choreographers closely observe the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of all types of person and that they make them recognisable in order that they convey meaning .

If the <head>atmosphere</head> were not so charming , it would be less of a temptation .

Cherney said  ( in the only programme - note )  that he had been inspired by Golani 's  bearing as well as her playing ,  and although the density of events was not high ,  the sense of concentration and unity between music and performer was total as the wilder elements were gradually exorcised and a numb calm remained .  Prousse ,  by Jean Papineau - Couture ,  argued an intense and clearly delineated course from climax to climax :  the most powerful of the evening 's  compositions ,  and the one most likely to attract other players .  These were both composers of the middle generation , known quantities by name at least , like Michael Colgrass whose Variations for Viola and Percussion ended the official programme in Bartok - and - Brittenish style , unfortunately with a built - in wrecking device for its own <head>atmosphere</head> : the drums must constantly be retuned . Robin Engelman ,  who coped patiently with the percussion part here ,  had a marginally less exciting time in Bruce Mather 's  Gatinara ,  where easy - going alternations of viola and marimba once took off in a bout of vigorous hocketing ,  but not for long .  Messages IV suggested greater youth in its composer ,  Stephen Tittle ,  who used a sort of minimalism with interruptions to build up a spirited and engaging little number ,  though hardly one to overstretch the skills of Bob Becker ,  the percussionist this time .

The churchmen were less buoyant ,  having presented Mr de Klerk with a memorandum in which they listed six steps he had to take immediately before negotiations about the government 's  much - vaunted new political dispensation could start .  Archbishop Tutu said in a news conference after the meeting that he was concerned about Mr de Klerk 's  failure to give any specific undertakings .  However , no doubt mollified both by the President 's dramatic decision on Tuesday to announce the release of eight long - term political prisoners and by the urbanity of his style , the archbishop did note that the talks had proceeded in a far better <head>atmosphere</head> than previous encounters he has had with the government . Appearing to agree in part with Mr de Klerk 's  assessment of the meeting ,  the churchmen said they saw their role as facilitators to get negotiation going .  The six steps proposed by this celebrated trinity of black anti - apartheid leaders were :  lifting the state of emergency ;  lifting political restrictions on individuals ;  releasing all those detained without trial ;  unbanning political organisations ;  releasing all political prisoners ;  reprieving all those sentenced to death .

Apart from Nigel Lawson ,  Nicholas Ridley ,  Cecil Parkinson ,  and Sir Geoffrey Howe ,  it was difficult to think of other Cabinet ministers who would be regarded as economically dry or ideologically Thatcherite ,  and both Lawson and Sir Geoffrey had well - publicized differences of opinion with Mrs Thatcher .  Mrs Thatcher 's  style certainly contributed to the Cabinet divisions between 1979 and 1981 and again after 1987 .  She has strong views on most issues and her propensity to express her views boldly at the outset of a Cabinet discussion , combined with a sometimes dismissive attitude towards opposing colleagues , tended to change the <head>atmosphere</head> and polarize Cabinet discussions . This contrasted with the approach of some other Prime Ministers .

Having flagged the issue and fired the interest of the minister , the Bank duo returned to the cooler , more workman - like <head>atmosphere</head> of life in Nairobi almost certain that sooner or later a project would go to the Bank board , and that it would almost certainly be approved . In fact it took another two years for the project to be fully studied ,  for the government to support its formal submission to the World Bank ,  for the Bank 's  board to approve it and for the first tranche of funds to flow .

Its life - cycle starts with a spore ,  of which there are countless millions in the atmosphere .  These spores are highly resistant tot extremes of heat and humidity and are very long - lived .  A spore which lands on wood with a moisture content of 2025 per cent in a still and stuffy <head>atmosphere</head> where the temperature is between 7 and 27C ( 44 and 80F ) can germinate and then throw out hollow strands known as hyphae . These initially hair - like fibres seek out and feed off the cellulose in the wood which is digested by the fungus to leave a dry ,  desiccated and fragile shell of wood - fibre or lignin which ,  in the absence of the cementitious cellulose ,  cannot continue to perform any structural role required of the timber .  Having drawn the cellulose from one section of the wood ,  the hyphae reach on to adjacent sections of timber to continue the process ,  while the strands of the initial attack unite into an equally fast - spreading cotton - wool - like growth known as mycelium .

More worryingly insidious is their ability to act as magnets to acid rain , taking it from the <head>atmosphere</head> and releasing it into the soil , where it leaches down and enters the water system . Nicholas Luard and the other members of the group were particularly concerned about the planting of conifers at Bara Ceirch farm as it stands at the headwaters of the Rivers Cothi and Towy ,  two of the finest salmon rivers in Wales .  The plantation itself is close to a feeder stream that runs straight into the Cothi ,  as would acid taken in by the conifers .

In what is a highly fluid situation ,  a senior opposition source said that he expected Forum ministers to be in office by the weekend .

It was clear that the longer the current unstable crisis <head>atmosphere</head> persists , the stronger the opposition 's bargaining position becomes . If its demands for a representative government are not met there is likely to be a general strike on Monday .  Mr Urbanec ,  who is to hold further talks with Mr Havel today  this time in front of television cameras  conceded that the party realised it was held in deep mistrust by the public ,  and accepted that henceforth it could only be part of the political spectrum .

Similarly ,  the mechanisms for heat transport in ocean currents is also mysterious ,  as the amounts of both heat and water within them is not well defined .  Nearly 10 per cent of the Earth 's  surface is covered by ice ,  which remains as terra incognita to climatologists as it was to 17th - century explorers .  Ice coverage limits the exchange of heat between the <head>atmosphere</head> and ocean , effectively insulating polar regions from sunlight during summertime . You 'd be amazed how little we know about the polar regions ,  says Dr Preben Goodmandsen of the Technical University of Denmark .  During the wintertime ,  there 's  no sunlight .

Luckily ,  he had a correspondent in his brother Theo in whom he could confide and with whom he could explore ideas about art ;  the letters are thus an invaluable source of interpretation .

Students usually find that the first term 's  work is relatively gentle .  At nearly all schools no stage performances will be seen by an audience until at least the end of the second term .  Sometimes students get anxious about this , and believe they are not making <head>audience</head> contact early enough ; but if you think about it , the reasoning is clear . Most of your technical tutors will be seeing everything you do ,  and deriving what they need to know from it ;  they do n't want to find you confused by criticism from senior students which might not be helpful to you at this point .  Ultimately ,  there are things in your training which you will accept  and those you may reject .

Students may find themselves performing in final productions over two full terms ,  which means they have the opportunity to play twice as many parts ,  but this depends on the school 's  policy and how they think you have progressed .  At this stage ,  too ,  the allocation of parts and the standard of performance is becoming a lot more competitive  a foretaste of the profession itself .  In many cases students will also tour in productions mounted by the school , and this gives good <head>audience</head> experience away from the greenhouse of school performances , where the people who sit in the <head>audience</head> are usually either professionally interested , or are fellow students and friends . Any programme of final drama school productions will present a variety of styles and the casting is aimed at giving students a chance to do well in suitable roles .  Naturally ,  with a cast of actors who are all approximately the same age ,  the casting of heavy character parts has to be considered very carefully ,  and of course not all plays are teeming with characters of similar age .

Certainly the new actor should never remain idle but create chances wherever possible .

Above all you need new <head>audience</head> experience now you are out of drama school . And ,  although nobody wishes to be exploited with low wages and very difficult conditions ,  it is frankly better to find the ways and means of presenting yourself somehow ,  than not perform at all .  The new actor is generally operating in top gear and if this momentum is stopped it can be very damaging to the morale and can result in an actor 's  technical skills going rusty  something to be avoided at all costs .

It was the ideas behind this design that so interested not only the <head>audience</head> but also the music critics of the time ( see page 41 ) . Massine not only paralleled the overall and short phrase rhythms of the music by those of the dancers ,  but the instruments of the orchestra by related groups of dancers .  Each group was led by a soloist representing the leader of a particular orchestral section so that as the themes were taken up by first one and then another section ,  the various groups of dancers joined in .

It may even present a comic ,  frivolous or bawdy joke to arouse laughter or attempt to reveal the workings of a composer 's  mind .  However , choreographers should always remember that whatever story , theme or music is chosen , it must be translated into clear , often simple , dance statements understandable by an <head>audience</head> . It should not be necessary to compile long programme notes ,  except perhaps in those cases where a poem is being interpreted  ( see page 28 )  .

Texture  Arrangement of threads ;  the characteristic feel or look of this arrangement This definition should be understood as the choreographer 's ability to establish a style of movement through which the <head>audience</head> will feel and understand what the performers are communicating through a particular way of dancing . The style must disclose and be expressive of the moods ,  emotions and actions of the roles played even where few personal feelings are allowed to show ,  as in such ballets as Ashton 's  Monotones  where all that is needed is a calm ,  unhurried and seemingly endless weaving of the dance design in all its dimensions .  Nevertheless the three dancers in Monotones  are expressing their close relationship to each other and to the space in which they dance and above all to the flowing lines of the design and of the musical phrases .

Choreographers who do not adhere strictly to the old conventions of court etiquette realise that their total design will flow more easily because their dancers '  behaviour will appear more spontaneous and natural .  For example :  each soloist need not begin with a formal bow to a king or to the audience ,  nor end with another bow or considered pose ;  but such behaviour may be included if the choreographer wishes to locate dance in a particular century and probably a palace in which the story unfolds .  Many new members of an <head>audience</head> have been known to object to the applause greeting the last bow . It breaks the continuity of the dance .  Other practices that once held up the flow of the dance were the continual closing in 5th position before a new step and the continual moving of the arms through 1st position at every change of weight or during a ports de bras  .

So explicit are the tiny gestures and the perfect timing of exits and entrances that the audience is forced to recognise the personal tragedy of a love that spoke no words .  Although MacMillan 's  choreography fur both the above ballets is based on classical technique ,  it in no way conforms to the old school of dance or conventional mime .  To portray specific characters , whether imagined or real ( some were known to members of the <head>audience</head> at the first performance of Enigma Variations and Isadora ) , the would - be choreographer can use classical dance as a firm base but must pay more attention to his characters as particular individuals . They live and work in a more varied ,  often plebeian ,  environment than that of courtiers in the palace of a prince .  The latter ,  after all ,  was the stereotype setting fur all classical ballet until 1789 ,  the year of the french Revolution .

This can be easily recognised if Bizet 's  music for Carmen  is compared with De Falla 's  fur The Three - Cornered Hat  .

When Dauberval removed to Bordeaux , the <head>audience</head> , like those elsewhere in france , was largely unaware of the grandeur of aristocratic entertainment . It welcomed the new ideas in La Fille Mal Garde  because the characters portrayed were familiar and were living in the farms and vineyards .

composers ,  authors ,  poets and painters ,  began to strengthen the national features of their work .  More typical and traditional folk dance steps and customs were absorbed into demi - caractre  dance and were accompanied by idiomatic features from national music .  When this happened , however , even the traditional features became more stereotyped because choreographers used only those which the <head>audience</head> could easily recognise and which were commonly seen and heard in a particular country . It was from such traditional dance that Fokine ,  at the instigation of Diaghilev ,  devised the first truly national ballets by breaking away from the sterotyped steps .  Instead ,  Fokine based his design  ( as did the composer Stravinsky and the artist Korovin  ( later Goncharova )  )  on the folk tales ,  customs ,  traditional dances and music of Russia without in any way conforming to the generally accepted rules of classical technique .

It is designed to display both dancer and dance to the best advantage from the <head>audience</head> 's point of view . It is a strict discipline upon which to build .  Its exponents are trained to feel how to move with each part of their bodies and to know how their movements must be coordinated to produce one or another step or pose .

She displays how to build living structures of pictorial importance by weaving individual dancers or groups deliberately and solemnly so that they frequently pause in a meaningful picture of distinctive shape .  These are the full stops to a paragraph that give the audience an opportunity to sum up  as it were  how the Bride 's  hair is cut ;  why the men convey the Groom to the Bride 's  house ;  how the Bride and Groom are blessed by their parents ;  and so on .  By so phrasing each paragraph and bringing each incident to a proper conclusion , Nijinska gives both dancers and <head>audience</head> time to consider what has been done and what is yet to happen . The nature of the formal shapes made by the dancers '  bodies and limbs as they move into and hold a picture must be evaluated .  Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes  in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints ,  thus the dancers '  bodies mostly face the audience but their arms and legs turn inwards and are seen mostly in profile .

There has always been a sense in which music is a secret ,  arcane ,  almost Cabbalistic ,  art .  But this introspective isolation ,  now compounded in so many cases by the fact that universities are the only institutions able to support a composer 's  existence ,  perpetuates the sense that the only right path for a serious composer is the romantic path of high seriousness and absolute individual integrity .  Robert Saxton , in these pages , recently denied that there was any longer a problem with contemporary music , and instead lectured the <head>audience</head> about paying closer attention . He did not mention that one definition of a composer 's  talent is that he can write music that compels an audience 's  attention .

They cannot expect to affect the development of a genius like Janacek .

That is quite simply to reduce by say 25 per cent the amount of time the eager opera <head>audience</head> wishes to spend listening to famous old works about famous old people and places , and instead increase the amount of time it wishes to spend listening to new works about ordinary people now . This is an exercise in persuasion ,  and requires composers who will focus their art on the simple and fundamental act of communication with their enthusiastic but tired ,  inattentive ,  restless ,  distracted and easily bored fellow human beings who none the less long to hear themselves in a not necessarily flattering mirror of music .

Limited scope exists for actors to develop individual characters : there is little room , in particular , to explore tensions between the sympathy and horror that Macbeth 's conflicts can elicit in an <head>audience</head> . Any loss in emotional or dramatic range ,  however ,  is generally compensated for by the fearsome intensity of the vision that results ,  and the compelling stylishness with which it is communicated .  Moving ,  like the witches ,  with confident ,  implacable force ,  the Citizens '  creates a Macbeth machine to assault a Scottish audience 's  expectations of this most familiar of Shakespeare 's  plays ,  leaving it ,  by the end ,  thoroughly drained and disturbed .

Any rule directly or indirectly restricting solicitors '  freedom to undertake all the actions necessary for the preparation and presentation of cases will need the approval of both the Secretary of State and the Lord President of the Court of Session .

But in what the Law Society also interpreted yesterday as a clear shift in emphasis from the English proposals ,  the paper makes it clear that the role of the Lord President would be no different from the one he currently exercises when approving training and professional rules .

In the true tradition of the pub boom at the turn of the century ,  although decidedly grand ,  most of these refurbishments do not take themselves deadly seriously .  The alabaster  freizes  of monks with  scatalogical  Latin inscriptions created by Henry Poole for the Blackfriar in c.1905 come from the same tradition as the eclectic and irreverent use of ethnic imagery and architectural detail built into the new Horniman at Hays Galleria of 1986 .

Eurotunnel ,  the Anglo - French consortium that will operate the twin - rail tunnel when it is scheduled to enter service in June 1993 ,  shocked the City by announcing that costs had risen by 2.2bn from an original estimate of 4.8bn ,  with the 50 - kilometre tunnel still only one - quarter built .  The consortium also disclosed that it would need up to 1.6bn in fresh finance on top of the 6bn already raised .  The gloom was deepened further by the disclosure that the independent technical adviser to <head>banks</head> financing the project puts the cost at 8.1bn and believes the tunnel will open six months late , in December 1993 . The crisis surrounding the tunnel threatens to embarrass the Government ,  which insisted it be financed entirely by the private sector .  The escalation in costs is certain to shake the confidence of private investors who have spent 1bn on the project .

By PATRICK HOSKING ,  Banking Correspondent KLEINWORT Benson ,  the merchant bank ,  has received A10.66m  ( 5.3m )  from the sale of its increasingly troubled Australian businesses  -  just half what it hoped for when it announced the deal in August .  It has also had to keep an undisclosed number of doubtful loans before offloading the unit , Kleinwort Benson Australia , to the California - based <head>bank</head> Security Pacific . KBA 's  activities include merchant banking ,  stockbroking ,  bullion trading and leasing .  It fell into the red last year ,  losing A2.6m .

But the reports still fell short of conclusively identifying the ultimate recipients of the money .  Faced with the prospect of a stream of disclosures as the general election approaches ,  Mr Gandhi 's  advisers have apparently concluded that their best defence is also to attack the opposition with the corruption stick .  The leader of the Janata Dal party , VP Singh , has found himself and his family under scrutiny in recent weeks over highly suspect allegations that his son controlled a secret <head>bank</head> - account in the Caribbean island of St Kitts . The allegations that Mr Singh ,  a former Congress  ( I )  finance minister ,  had stashed millions of dollars in a numbered St Kitts account ,  were made in August in the Arab Times of Kuwait ,  not previously known for its scoops about India .  It said the account was controlled by Mr Singh 's  son Ajeya ,  a New York - based accountant .

The saving on interest rate costs by taking out a foreign currency mortgage is obvious enough  about 5 per cent to 6 per cent .  The big pitfall is the prospect of a currency loss if sterling declines still further ,  which can wipe out the benefit of interest rate savings and leave the borrower owing more debt than he borrowed in the first place .  Because of this , foreign currency mortgages , which are being sold very heavily at the moment by financial intermediaries ( linked to <head>banks</head> and other financial institutions which are providing the funds ) , are only for the financially sophisticated . There are ways of hedging against the exchange rate risk .  One method is to switch the foreign currency loan back into sterling if you think that sterling will weaken significantly  more than a possibility .

The sole qualification for obtaining a vehicle is that you receive mobility supplement for a long enough period to cover the length of the agreement .

This vision ,  what Eliot called Kipling 's  knowledge of the things which are underneath ,  and of the things which are beyond the frontier ,  ,  was what made some of Kipling 's  short stories so important to the writer of The Waste Land  .  It was like Frazer 's  looking into the abysm of time ,  but it was a vision only imperfectly appreciated by Charlie Mears ,  as the narrator of The Finest Story in the World emphasizes :  Above all ,  he was absolutely ignorant of the knowledge sold to me for five pounds ;  and he would retain that ignorance ,  for bank - clerks do not understand metempsychosis ,  and a sound commercial education does not include Greek .  To find its most lasting realization , Charlie 's vision would have to wait for a bank clerk who did understand metempsychosis , and who had not only a commercial education gained in an underground room at Lloyds <head>Bank</head> , but also a knowledge of Greek . The Waste Land 's   tone would be grimmer ,  throbbing between two lives .  But when such a bank clerk followed Charlie ,  Rudyard Kipling entered The Waste Land  .

She showed them the small lake in its ring of reeds , took them to the first slopes of the mountain , rigged up a fishing rod for Michael and took him to the part of the lake she used to fish as a girl , and soon he was shouting out in glee as he missed the ravenous little perch or swung them out over his head on to the <head>bank</head> .

Few lakes or reservoirs start to warm up until late March ,  and the deeper ones are normally cold well into May .  The shallow bays may be a degree or two warmer ,  and are always the first place to look in the early days ,  but the deeps will stay cold until real strength returns to the sun .  Fish normally seek out the warmer shallows , and if there are a few days of sunshine before opening day then you will know where to choose on the <head>bank</head> .

This begins with the figure impinging powerfully from a distance ,  in this case as one walks into St Martin 's  at Landshut ,  more powerfully than other things in the field of view .  What carries most punch here is ,  of course ,  the gilt y - shaped motif of the folds offered by the Virgin 's  mantle to stretch a phrase ,  a Leinberger sculpture is a permanent possibility of cumulative sensation .  For , once we have made the first approach to the Landshut Virgin and acquired a first set of impressions , the changeableness of the figure <head>begins</head> to work on us further , now less in the dimension of greater or lesser distance and more in the angle of view . In comparison ,  One 's  relation to Riemenschneider 's  Altar of the Holy Blood is a little passive :  one waits and the shift of light will change its mood and meaning .  This extended critical evaluation is a rarity in a survey ,  but very welcome in the way it spells out a connoisseur 's  response in formal terms to a work of art .

They are thus not simply a mentality derived from popular religion but from a traditional Roman catholicism which held sway in catholic Europe from the post - Reformation period and remained unchallenged until the 1960s .  As will be seen in Chapter 5 ,  understanding this religious social consciousness requires some grasp of the traditional catholic teaching on the natural order and the good society ,  and how the nation is to respect the divine order  established by God .  An example of this can be taken from the recent contraception controversy in the Republic , which <head>began</head> in the 1960s . At that time ,  the Roman catholic archbishop of Dublin intervened in a pastoral letter in the following revealing terms :  If they who are elected to legislate for our society should unfortunately decide to pass a disastrous measure of legislation that will allow the public promotion of contraception and an access hitherto unlawful to the means of contraception ,  they ought to know clearly the meaning of their action ,  when it is judged by the norms of objective morality  and the certain consequences of such a law

A campaign <head>begun</head> in 1971 to repeal the ban dating from 1935 culminated in the famous appeal of Mrs McGee to the Supreme Court to declare she had a right to use contraceptives .

Until recently ,  catholics in the North were practically forbidden by their clergy to attend state schools ,  exceptions being made in certain outlying areas .  Bishop Edward Daly in Derry liberally interpreted the needs of his Roman catholic pupils from the mid - 1970s ,  allowing greater freedom and seeing to it that some alternative religious education was provided .  At the same time , the late Bishop Philbin <head>began</head> to refuse the sacrament of Confirmation to Roman catholic children attending state schools . A number of clergy in his diocese refused religious instruction to these children .  The reason given was that children would not be religiously and  educationally prepared for the reception of Holy Communion and Confirmation because they had not been educated at a catholic school ,  irrespective of their parents '  alternative provisions :  in one area ,  parents had set up their own Sunday schools as an alternative .

If the philosophical discontinuity Foucault describes is truly occurring ,  then an inside or reflexive exploration of police practice should reveal the strength of these divisive classificatory techniques ,  for any binary separation of man by his contemporaries into the non - human categories suggested by Leach  ( 1982 )  is the very stuff of anthropology .  And if such a classificatory system is a major feature of the way the police control their fellow citizens ,  then it seems essential it should be identified ,  assessed ,  and described .  Foucault ( 1980 ) , like Thompson ( 1980 ) , asserts that the criminal justice system is increasingly becoming an arm of the state apparatus , with the institution of policing <head>beginning</head> to wield expanding socio - political power . In a liberal democracy this needs to be scrutinized constantly ,  and herein lies the first problem for the researcher .  For how can one really study a system of state control without acknowledging that such an activity itself is antithetical to  the direction of power ?

They get far more than they bargain for .  ( Grillo 1980 :  3 )  In effect , the insider who reveals the structural formations of a system of power inverts that power and the revelation creates a situation where elements of anti - structure ( Turner 1969 , 1974 ) now present a version of how things might be constituted ; and what has been seen as solid reality <head>begins</head> to be identified as only one social possibility . In this observing participation ,  the thick description which Geertz  ( 1975 )  argued for comes hurtling at the ethnographer ,  so that the classic use of an anthropological informant is hardly necessary .  Rather it will be a case of the researcher finding a means of recording and sorting the mass of detail which continuously bombards him and presents him with the lateral possibilities which make the discipline potentially dangerous .

I acted as unofficial welfare officer for others and spent untold hours merely listening as the unworldly struggled to achieve the alternative vision of a new heaven on earth .  Our sixty - four arrests included a few for the traditional crimes of burglary  ( but now at chemist 's  shops )  ,  forgery  ( but of NHS prescriptions ,  not bank notes )  ,  as well as the new offences of unlawful possession of amphetamine or LSD .  Court cases and the resulting media responses given to these new drug fiends ( to use the phrase coined by Stanley Cohen ( 1973 ) ) verged almost on the hysterical ( see Young 1977 ) , and moral entrepreneurs <head>began</head> to press for more controls and increased action . Questions were raised in the House of Commons about a group of local hippies arrested early in 1967 ,  and local MPs vied with each other to be in the vanguard of efforts to control the army of secret drug takers in the area  ( who need to be )  brought back from the brink of madness  ( Newcastle Evening Chronicle  :  27 February 1967 )  .  Much of this fervour ,  as Furlong suggests  ( 1973 )  ,  occurred because of social confusion about this new activity .

Our new semantic understanding was therefore linked to the changing epiphenomena of dress ,  hair ,  clothing ,  and the other symbols of the body I have mentioned ;  but it was also manifest in an irrepressible need to reinterpret and question the social condition ,  for I had journeyed beyond the norms of the police system ,  where action to control is preferably a simple  matter of enforcing the rules and regulations as they stand .  Yet this move into anti - structure was merely beginning .  The unconventional , questioning form I had <head>begun</head> to pursue was rewarded by an invitation in 1972 to attend United Nations European Social Affairs Division in Geneva . Experts from a variety of European agencies were brought together to discuss and report on the various cross - cultural attitudes to drug - taking among young people .  In this setting the qualitative was constantly under evaluation at the expense of the quantitative measure ,  for the wise amongst us who were present knew that the statistical return often gives a skewed version of complex social events ,  although it speaks volumes about the way our systems of control are generated and maintained .

All hell rules over the man who is angry ,  says the Talmud ,  and by September 1939 ,  when Leonard was beginning to come to terms with the thresholds of life 's  reality ,  hell was ruling the world ,  or at least appeared to be .  War had been declared ,  and the fate of Czechoslovakia ,  Austria and Poland was sealed ,  as it would be for several other countries .  It would be six years before that anger would <head>begin</head> to subside , six years of unspeakable anguish for those of Hebrew persuasion , when unbelievable monstrosities would be inflicted on them , by the end of which half of the world 's Jewry had been murdered . This was carefully shielded from the growing boy ,  though horror of a personal ,  more penetrating sort was to obtrude itself soon enough on him. The genteel and pleasant routine of life which he understood ,  despite the lengthening shadow of his father 's  illness ,  was convulsed in 1943 ,  when Nathan Cohen died ,  and the family was plunged into loss and grief .

Like any form of art ,  music has an intrinsic ability to revitalise itself ;  but when this is stimulated by external factors ,  for example ,  those that become operative in the wake of the industrial revolution ,  the Darwinian ferment and the resurgence of nationalism in the 19th century ,  not least a species of war - mongering ,  then wholly new genres may emerge .  Such had happened in Scotland and Ireland in its employment of folk - themes for late 19th century classical music .  And in England in the shape of Cecil Sharp and company it too <head>began</head> to assert its own folk - music ( over Continental , largely Teutonic forms ) in the opening decades of the present century . Many of these had found their way across America and Canada with the early settlers ,  along with psalm versions and hymnody .  The wave of interest in the rediscovery of Celtic music is particularly important ,  and not merely because of the Celtic - Scottish influence on Leonard 's  family  ( an aspect that the  Montreal Gazette  highlighted regarding Lyon Cohen 's  Gaelic accent recently )  and American eclecticism  often little more than a slavish following of European forms  which found itself in the development of pop music ,  notably of ragtime around 1900 and jazz around 1918 .

Leonard was but 21 when it was first published ,  though the poems were culled from his output from 15 to 20 years of age ,  according to an interview he gave to Andrew Tyler of Disc  in 1972 .  It was not ,  however ,  the luxuriance of his style or language which his former mentor ,  Louis Dudek ,  focused on in 1958 ,  but the total negation ,  the high condition .  Professor Dudek , who had <head>begun</head> to express criticism rather than encouragement for the young poet , went on to speak of an intellectual disorder ( not only in politics , but in morality and religion ) which leads to a primitive mythological effort to organise chaos ( it ) proceeds from a state of mind fundamentally disturbed , and bordering on the deeply neurotic or worse . Mythological or not ,  it has to be emphasised that he was speaking here of a group of poets  Ellenborgen ,  Hine ,  Mandel ,  Purdy ,  Macpherson ,  Layton and Cohen  not just Leonard himself .  But he clearly places Leonard within this group which ,  he held ,  grasps at a confusion of symbolic images ,  often a ragbag of classical mythology ,  in the effort to organise a chaos too large for them to deal with in the light of reason ,  which in turn causes them to express a sardonic bitterness in their social criticism ,  a realism without any utopian idealism to support it .

Lofoten is a small group of islands sticking out off Arctic Norway rather like the Outer Hebrides do off Scotland .

This is a person who sees nothing to recommend the Duomo at Siena  ( it seems to have been got by outlining )  ,  nor Sienese painting in general :  evidence of love ;  but not of art Mercifully for us they had gold leaf in plenty .

Certainly you would have to be in pretty desperate case to dismiss the eloquent Michelozzo figures on the cenotaph frieze in the Duomo as wriggling in lines like leeches in a bottle .  The best places for bottles in Montepulciano are the cool brick cantine like that of the Contucci Palace ,  cellars furred with black fungus where Vino Nobile has been produced for a thousand years .

No one would lightly believe that either of them has ever found it hard to tell the difference between himself and somebody else .

That Bellow , this participant in Roth 's inner life , can also be said to be out there in the world as his friend , and perhaps his rival , is a fact which does not help one to <head>decide</head> whether or not to trust the reports of literary duality what comes in has to have been out but it is very much in the tradition .

All of these observations of correlations between ERPs and different kinds of behaviour ,  including phenomenological reports ,  may tell us something about mental representations and the cognitive processes generating them ,  but they can tell us nothing about whether these representations and processes are conscious or unconscious .  It is the essential but usually overlooked fact that in any psychophysical experiment when ,  for example ,  subjects are asked whether or not they perceive a stimulus ,  their responses ,  verbal or otherwise ,  cannot be relied on as accurate accounts of their conscious experiences .  So , in a near - threshold task the subject may be accurately identifying the presence of a stimulus which tells the experimenter that there is some kind of mental representation of the stimulus , but there is no way the experimenter can <head>decide</head> whether or not the subject is consciously aware of the stimulus . Indeed ,  it is a common observation in experiments of this kind that subjects themselves often express confusion about what they are conscious of .  The problem arises whenever we try to use conscious awareness as a dependent variable :  for example ,  when we want to decide whether or not a particular external event leads to a phenomenal event .

The line in Provenal is from Bertran de Born 's  Planh for the Young English King ,  which Pound had translated splendidly as early as 1909 .

Anyone is free to <head>decide</head> that life is too short for such unriddlings ; others ( I speak from experience ) may develop a taste for them . A more important point is that passages of this sort ,  spliced as they are with images like the lizard from the immediate foreground of Pound 's  tent inside the wire - mesh cage of the prison camp ,  do not come into being out of the free associations of idle reverie ,  though in these Pisan cantos Pound exploits the illusion of that ,  as Joyce did in Ulysses  when he pretended to transport himself and us into the mind of Leopold Bloom .  The reason we are reminded of these historical episodes ,  rather than any of a hundred others ,  comes clear only with the surprising and congested line that closes the quatrains about the Wars of the Roses :  But oblivion ,  not thy forgiveness ,  FRANCE .

The scale on which Pound was working was not clear even to the poet himself ;  so that the eleven cantos which he originally designated as preparation of the palette are now by responsible commentators considerably extended  to the extent that the first thirty cantos ,  which are all that the twenties knew of the poem  (  A Draft of XVI Cantos   ( Paris ,  June 1925 )  ;  A Draft often Cantos  1727   ( 100 copies ,  September 1928 )  ;  and A Draft of XXX Cantos   ( 210 copies ,  August 1930 )  )  ,  are now often regarded as laying out no the painter 's  palette the hues that only in subsequent cantos would be combined to polemical and imaginative purpose .  Certainly only in the next batch of cantos  ( post - 1930 )  ,  which began with extended excerpts from the founding fathers of the Republic ,  would the scale of magnitude of the poem become apparent ,  also its topicality and its Americanness .  Of the first thirty cantos by themselves , no account is more plausible than that of a writer in the New York Herald Tribune Books for 9 January 1927 , who <head>decided</head> : Mr Pound is avowedly writing a history of the Mediterranean basin ' The writer  was Ford Madox Ford ,  who was among the most loyal as he had been among the first of Pound 's  friends ;  in the twenties he was as penurious and as out of fashion as Pound .  It is easy to cheat when quoting from these early cantos :  either by imposing a seeming self - closure on passages that are in fact open at both ends ,  or  ( and as well )  by presenting a lyrically appealing passage as typical of the whole .

Commemorative figures in city squares ,  portrait busts ,  tomb or cemetery furniture have also been traditionally restricted by the terms of commissions .  A consequence of this tradition is that the sculptor 's  own personality may receive less prominence in a monograph than a painter 's  ,  as the effect of patronage given or withheld can be decisive in a sculptor 's  career .  The other major role of the sculptor is in the service of religion , where a high <head>degree</head> of interplay between artist and patron is not necessarily so important , making the sculptor 's situation into one which is more like the painter 's . Writing on Auguste Rodin can make the point .  According to George Heard Hamilton ,  Rodin became a figure of international significance ,  the most admired ,  prolific ,  and influential sculptor since Bernini .

Remember that there may be some twelve to eighteen places at any one of the drama schools ,  and the number of auditions may number up to fifteen hundred for the leading schools .

No drama school panel is looking for the ultimate in audition technique but candidates should possess a noticeable <head>degree</head> of competence and self - awareness . Not all auditions have just two speeches ,  classical and modern .

If you have done any class work before attempting the drama school audition ,  most of the teachers will at some point in their sessions have talked about relaxation .  A lot has to do with how you breathe and how you react physically to moments of tension .  You will be tense at the audition because a lot is at stake , but if you trust to your own natural resources , the <head>degree</head> of panic can be reduced . I would suggest that if you are sure of your pieces ,  do n't read them over and over again on the way to the audition  once will be quite enough .  Nerves afflict everyone in some way ,  and without them acting would be the poorer .

A dislike by Irish clerics for such an explicit and direct church  state relationship has a long tradition and comes out best in De Tocqueville 's   ( 1957 )  conversations with Irish clergy on his visit to Ireland in 1834 .  When asked if they would like subventions from the state to aid their stipends and church buildings ,  a move which was being seriously considered by the British government at the time ,  priests and bishops were united in rejecting the idea on the grounds that it would drive a wedge between clergy and people ,  identifying clergy with the principal enemies of the people .  De Tocqueville 's notes reveal not only the conscious opposition to such a mode of religious power but also how deep the solidarity between clergy and people was , the <head>degree</head> to which the poor , half the catholic population at the time , looked to the clergy for material and spiritual leadership , guidance , and assistance , and how much they trusted them . However ,  with the emergence of the Southern Irish state ,  it soon became clear that this secularization of the state form was not to signify an absence of Roman catholic power in the construction of public morality ,  but rather an indirect recognition of the sovereignty of the church in most areas of moral concern besides education .  In fact ,  precisely because Roman catholic power was to be accepted as normative in an entirely natural way by the catholic  nationalist population ,  the church 's  part - active and part - passive  acceptance of the capitalist system of government and thorough opposition to socialism had a significant legitimating function for the Irish state - form .

Both these establishments seem to have had an architectural form very similar to the ordinary domestic buildings of their area ,  and the hall provided the communal eating and drinking space .  The tavern was a meeting place ,  usually in the centre of the town or village ,  where wine was normally served .  According to John Earle , writing in 1628 , the inn was a superior establishment to the alehouses and was a <head>degree</head> or ( if you will ) a pair of stairs above an alehouse , where men are drunk with more credit and apology . The alehouse in its most basic form was simply a domestic building where ale was sold to generate additional income for the household ,  although David Lupton observed in 1632 that the alehouse keeper  defies a wine tavern as an upstart outlandish fellow ,  and suspects the wine to be poisoned .  Her ale ,  if new ,  looks like a misty morning ,  all thick  .

Indeed ,  the fact that he had apparently used an editor from a Manchester newspaper for some of his purposes was latched onto and quoted as a sign that he was suspect and disloyal .  One consequence of these modes of thought is that the service has to live out a continuous and enormous paradox .  Even at the same time as it publicly commends higher education , seeking out the graduate entrant , spending large sums on publicity to this end , and funding access to <head>degree</head> courses on scholarships , it also holds to a central ethic of distrust of the academic . Whitaker  ( 1979 :  229 )  clearly understands the way this rejection of training and education operates within the service :  at present good recruits often have to be chased to Bramshill on the lengthy command courses ,  because chief constables are not anxious to spare able men ,  and officers themselves are reluctant to be separated from their families and homes ,  as well as having a fear that they might lose from being out of sight ,  out of mind for promotion .

It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force  police service which remains unresolved ,  on which I will say more later in relation to the role of women police officers .  The dark uniform we wore had a military cap with polished brim ,  and in our fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boots we presented an avenging image ,  clothed in the symbolic colour of death and darkness .  Black is a light absorbent , non - reflective colour and most suitable for controllers who operate with a <head>degree</head> of social anonymity , upholding the rule of law and the abstractions of the legal system . In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .  As Reiner  ( 1980 )  suggested ,  the riot gear in which the police are increasingly seen ,  with shields ,  visored helmets ,  knee - length boots ,  and flame - proof overalls ,  enhances their avenging appearance .

ln addition we used voters '  degree of preference for their first - choice party  ( over their second choice )  as yet another potential influence upon their ratings of the media 's  usefulness .  The main influences on usefulness - ratings were people 's  interest in politics and their motivations for following the campaign .  Their <head>degree</head> of preference for one party Over others had an important influence upon the usefulness - ratings they gave the media for helping them decide how to Vote ( those with clear preferences found the media less useful for that purpose ) but had little or no influence on other aspects of usefulness - ratings . Surprisingly ,  perceptions of bias never had a significant impact on usefulness - ratings .  The factors influencing ratings given to television for providing information on personalities and issues were almost identical to each other.

Since that showed a <head>degree</head> of consistency in attitudes , it was not entirely unexpected . More surprising was the relationship with political interest .  Television scored best on helping people decide how to Vote if they found politics interesting during the campaign but had lacked a general interest in politics in the mid - term .

For decades ,  as the Royal Commission on Wealth and Income demonstrated in the late 1970s ,  those disparities were modified by the social benefits available under the welfare state .  By the end of the 1980s ,  partly as a result of deliberate government action ,  more perhaps because the unduly optimistic assumptions of Beveridge and other founders of the British welfare system were being falsified by financial and cultural factors  ( such as the breakdown of the old nuclear family of fabled tradition )  ,  the welfare state was far less able to temper the asperities of a harsh and divided society .  The beleaguered ranks of social workers and investigators of the 1980s documented a society more unsettled , more helpless , and to some <head>degree</head> more violent than at any period since the century began . Finally ,  there was constant angst  about Britain 's  world role .  The direction of Britain 's  post - imperial policy was unclear after 1945 .

In concentrating all matrimonial legislation in a new secular High Court in London ,  the Act also represented the success of common and equity lawyers in capturing full control of matrimonial litigation .  To explain the nature of legal change Stone offers a model that suggests first ,  that clients revealed the gap between current values and the law ;  second ,  that this was followed by the attempt of lawyers and judges to narrow the gap ,  often by inventing legal fictions or effectively changing the law by judicial re - interpretation  ( the changing definition of legal cruelty provides one example of this )  ;  and third ,  that all this culminated eventually in legal change when the level of duplicity and hypocrisy became intolerable to law lords and legislators alike  ( pp. 1920 )  .  This model , which echoes that used by Oliver MacDonagh to explain the growth in nineteenth century government , relies on a high <head>degree</head> of consonance in the wishes of lawyers and their clients , a not unreasonable assumption given the limited access to divorce in Stone 's period . But it is not a model that holds up for the twentieth century ,  when liberalization of the divorce law was not a matter of last resort but was rather always proposed as a means of strengthening the institution of marriage  ( by permitting those living in sin to remarry )  ;  when opinion shifted with dramatic speed ,  for example between the conservative recommendations of the 1956 Royal Commission on Divorce and the endorsement of profound liberalization given a mere ten years later by both the Law Commission and the Church of England ;  and when the change in views of key institutions such as the Church of England were as important as those of lawyers .  The permission given by the 1969 Act for no - fault divorce was driven as much by a profound rethinking of the sources of morality by clerical and academic opinion as by the determined pursuit of individual self - interest on the part of either the population at large or lawyers in particular .

A survey of the 1320 companies registered in Nigeria in 1970 indicated that 400 were wholly foreign - owned ,  including nearly all of the largest .  In the same year in Kenya it has been estimated that African citizens and government institutions owned only about 5 per cent of corporate assets .  Consequently , relations between African countries and international companies were for twenty years characterized by a battle to take some <head>degree</head> of national control . Strategies for control have included the compulsory sale of 51 per cent of the share capital in the businesses nationalized by Tanzania 's  Arusha Declaration in 1967 ,  the compulsory sale of the majority of share capital by all large companies in Nigeria from 1974 to 1977 ,  and the creeping sale of 20 per cent of issued share capital in the Ivory Coast required from 1975 onwards  ( achieved by issuing new equity )  .  In Tanzania ,  Julius Nyerere commented ,  Our purpose was primarily a political purpose ;  it was an extension of the political control which the Tanzanian people secured in 1961 .

Cinema developed alongside the wireless and the telephone as communications media that would change the way people perceived the world around them .

They may have felt a <head>degree</head> of excitement as they turned their cameras on a train arriving at a station , waves crashing on the beach , or a group of workers emerging from their daily grind in the factory , but these early pieces of reportage were seen as nothing more than animated photographs , a further step in the development of photography . A little later ,  as filmmakers began to expend the medium 's  storytelling capacities ,  they drew from the techniques developed for the magic lantern or diorama and audiences saw a woman interrupting her husband in the act of kissing the maid ,  or a miller grappling with chimney sweeps in front of a windmill .  It was natural to see these moving pictures as nothing more than a novelty ,  perhaps merely a passing gimmick ;  they were ,  after all ,  only shown as an additional turn on the music - hall programme .

Although the boto is a powerful animal ,  and can sometimes tear its way out of nets ,  more often it becomes entangled and drowns .

According to Best and da Silva , the <head>degree</head> of hostility from commercial fishermen towards the boto is unquestionably growing . In the past this has been countered by the numerous superstitions of the indigenous peoples towards the river dolphins ,  but as the economic pressures of the commercial fishery become greater ,  these superstitions are likely to become less respected ,  especially by the younger fishermen .  Development pressures in the Amazon basin ,  such as the construction of hydro - electric dams ,  deforestation ,  and commercial fishing ,  have brought a flood of new settlers to the area .

Levi 's  double life as chemist and writer suggests that if art and work need to be separated ,  according to a certain sense of what it is to be a Jew ,  art and work are nevertheless very often the same .  I like to think that he would have accepted that art is work ,  that the work that frees us ,  and is not just punishment ,  is art ,  and that anyone who uses his imagination is an artist .  The categorical <head>difference</head> of the modern world , between artists and others , does not come well out of his reports . His chemistry is intriguing from this point of view .  Here was a second double life  that of a scientist who was also an artist ,  a chemist who was also an alchemist ,  a businessman who was also a magician .

The fact that a wide number of manufacturers work to the same pattern means that the caterer who is topping up need not return to the same source for the top - up. Identify a selection of cutlery distributors ,  send them one of your pieces of cutlery and ask them to match it and send their sample and yours back .  There will be some <head>differences</head> , but they may be too slight to be noticed by the customers , who would normally see only one piece of each item in any case . Shopping around for a top - up will allow the best price while still keeping the cutlery service in the same style .  One way of putting off the day of replacement is to take more care of existing cutlery .

It means that we can think about things that are not present .  Sure enough ,  we would expect the input systems to ensure that the right kinds of distinctions are drawn  between contour changes that define occlusion and those which define disappearance ,  for example  but this surely does not mean that the possessor of these input systems is capable of thinking about unperceived entities .  What this adds up to , then , is the claim that if there existed an organism which either could not act or whose actions made no <head>difference</head> to its perceptions then not only would that organism not be cognisant , it could never become cognisant . ( It is not clear to me whether this is some kind of philosophical claim or an hypothesis .  You may say that it is refutable  and so it is empirical ;  but then  see below  our criteria for cognisance are so much bound up with what the subject can do that it is difficult to see how we could assess the cognisance of a totally passive creature .  )

There is little to distinguish between the Italian character dance and its demi   -  caractre  form save only that heeled shoes are worn and thus from time to time take on a slightly Spanish flavour ,  the only difference perhaps being the more fluid way of phrasing and less rigidly accurate timing of the steps .  For all their liveliness of style any of the above national dances seen in one ballet resemble those in another because choreographers such as Petipa ,  Bournonville and Saint - Lon utilised the same steps and ports de bras  again and again .  Only the music created slight <head>differences</head> and this not markedly because the composers used the best of commonly recognised traditional musical idioms . Possibly the best of commonly recognised character dance styles are found in Copplia ,  Swan Lake   ( Old and Soviet versions )  and La Boutique Fantasque  .  Even Massine 's  choreographic genius realised that the old stylised forms were the best way to portray the national dolls sold in the shop .

The point has been frequently made that there is no necessary reason why dog should mean the familiar ,  faithful ,  barking ,  domestic quadruped ,  which in other languages ,  gets referred to as chien ,  Hund ,  cane  ,  etc. And within the language - system of English ,  the sounds and letters of d - o - g are recognizable as such simply because they are not d - i - g ,  or d - o - n ,  or l - o - g .

Thus Pound was quite ready ,  and became eager ,  to deliver a message ,  though with more obliquities and delays than the impatiently moralistic reader could see reason for ;  whereas Eliot ,  true to his inheritance from French symbolisme  ,  was sceptical and chary of conveying in poetry any message at all .  ( Pound had studied some of the same French poets ,  notably Laforgue and Rimbaud ,  but he had profited by them in a quite different way from Eliot ,  and he was averse to the central thrust of the symboliste  endeavour ,  to which indeed the imagist or imagiste  movement which he had sponsored had been intended as a challenging alternative .  )  The <head>difference</head> between the two of them showed up in The Waste , Land drafts . For among the rather few objections by Pound that Eliot paid no attention to were one or two which would have required him to make consistent ,  in terms of locality and historical period ,  some of his references to London life .  Eliot seems to have ignored these suggestions because for him the physical and social landscape of London was no more than a screen on which to project a phantasmagoria that expressed his own personal disorders and desperations  ( partly sexual ,  as one might expect ,  and as the drafts make clear )  ;  whereas Pound seems to have supposed that the subject of the poem was London in all its historical and geographical actuality ,  much as the city of Dublin was from one point of view the subject of Joyce 's  Ulysses  .

The French seem more nervous about buying garden flats ,  for example ,  than the British ,  so these can often be proportionately cheaper .  Flats at the top of older buildings without lifts are also less expensive for those healthy enough to cope with walking up six floors .

The market is so bad now that it wo n't get any worse ,  at least in the South ,  said Richard Roberts ,  an economist with Barclays Bank .  It will go on being like it is for longer .  Many estate agents were whistling to keep up their confidence this week , claiming that people were already used to the idea of higher mortgage rates and that the latest increase would make little <head>difference</head> . But Gary Marsh ,  head of research with the Halifax ,  the UK 's  biggest building society ,  says it is inevitable that the modest improvement seen in the market over the last couple of months  especially in the South ,  where sellers have started to adjust to more realistic levels  will be damaged and the date of its recovery put back .  I think we are going to see that slight pick - up disappear .

4 Application of marketing ideas in an international context As companies go international they need to pose the question Are there differences between domestic and international marketing ?  Although significant <head>differences</head> exist , the basic similarities should be remembered . The essential concepts and processes of marketing apply as much to marketing in the international arena as the domestic one .  So ,  when a company first looks to expand abroad ,  the same process needs to be adopted .

However ,  whilst this method of comparison relies on easily available information ,  it is not exact ;  exchange rates relate to goods which are traded internationally ,  whilst the the majority of the national product of most countries is comprised of goods which never enter the international marketplace .  The differences in real income can thus be distorted .  As just one example , agricultural goods are generally priced lower in relation to industrial products in developing countries than in industrial countries , and this may lead to an exaggeration of the apparent <head>differences</head> in per capita income . Another potentially distorting factor is that whilst average incomes can be compared between one country and another ,  they do not of themselves reveal the true comparable standard of living ,  nor the comparable potential markets for all products .  Developing countries ,  for example ,  consume many of the same goods as industrialised countries ,  but may have little or no expenditure on heating ,  public utilities ,  medicine ,  etc.

Public awareness of opinion polls was most predictable in the Pre - Campaign Wave and became steadily less predictable as the election approached and awareness spread throughout the electorate .  Before the campaign opened the key influence on poll awareness was a generalized interest in politics ,  but as the  campaign drew to an end television viewing became more important .  Before the campaign there was a 41 per cent <head>difference</head> in awareness of polls between those with high and low levels of interest in politics ; but this declined to 22 per cent by the end of the campaign . Readers of lowbrow papers were relatively ill informed about polls before the campaign but caught up with highbrow readers later .

Histories of art appeared in sequences of volumes by <head>different</head> authors , there were several series of books about artists and on museum collections , besides which the most comprehensive biographical dictionary of artists by Ulrich Thieme and Felix Becker started its long publication process in 1907 .

Fry was a connoisseur of Renaissance art ,  but also he defended Post - Impressionism  ( a term he invented )  ,  was a painter ,  and published a monograph on Czanne .

Unlike old - fashioned narrative history ,  art has no decisive battles ,  no international treaties ,  and no changes of government .  This is perhaps a more useful analogy than might at first sight appear .  Newer approaches to history can give accounts which do not have landmark events and which tell us about <head>different</head> aspects of the past , such as social conditions . Deciding where is the beginning can be a trouble for an art historian .  In Europe ,  classical times are a beginning for historians ,  but not for archaeologists .

The interpretation of imagery ,  the circumstances of production ,  the place of the work in the artist 's  career ,  the historical context ,  the precise information about the work 's  appearance and condition ,  these are things that can be fully discussed in a monograph .   VERSATILE ARTISTS A monograph on an artist who practises in several fields can be unusually interesting , since the writer 's brief is to write with equal competence on <head>different</head> topics . Occasionally the challenge is too daunting ,  and teams of writers combine forces rather than one author attempting to rival the knowledge and skills of a Leonardo .  More frequently work in different media is split up into specialist studies ,  so that although there are general studies of Gauguin 's  work ,  there are also specialist monographs on his prints ,  and on his sculpture and ceramics .

Moreover ,  His role shifted easily from the alienated critic writing art columns for intellectual magazines to an impresario in the New York art - world judged by his commitment to a specific type of art and respected for its ultimate  ( commercial and influential )  success .  Greenberg 's  articles are marked by a confident authority ,  as in the following passage .  Looser paint - handling , combined with what remained an essentially Cubist sense of design , drawing , layout , was what artists as <head>different</head> as Gorky and Pollock had in common during the mid - 1940s . If the term Abstract Expressionist means anything verifiable ,  it means painterliness :  loose ,  rapid handling ,  or the look of it ;  masses that blot and fuse instead of shapes that stay distinct ;  large ,  conspicuous rhythms ;  broken  color  ;  uneven saturations or densities of paint ;  exhibited brush ,  knife ,  finger or rag marks  in short a constellation of physical features like those defined by Wlflinn when he extracted his notion of the Malerische  from Baroque art .  As we can now see ,  the displacing of the linear and quasi - geometrical as the dominant mode in New York  ( and Parisian )  abstract art after 1943 offers another instance of that cyclical alternation of non - painterly ,  or linear ,  and painterly which has marked the evolution of Western art since the sixteenth century .

So again ,  laboratory techniques were affording scientists a glimpse of their subjects '  mental lives .

The viewing medium can be X - rays ,  as in computerized tomographic  ( CT )  scans ;  magnetic resonance of atomic nuclei ,  as in nuclear magnetic resonance  ( NMR )  scans ;  or emission from radioactively labelled substances incorporated into the structure of nerve cells as in positron emission tomographic  ( PET )  scans .  These obviously have considerable clinical value for localizing and identifying areas of brain abnormality ,  but they also enable areas of activity in the normally functioning brain to be pictured .

On such a large piece it was possible to achieve the facial features and details of the clothing by gentle removal of material by holding the grinder and cutter to the work at many different angles carefully and in a safe manner .  Do not hold the grinder back to front ,  and never remove the guard .  To complete , the whole piece was dressed down with as many and as fine cuts as possible again using <head>different</head> angles of attack , all the time experimenting . For more definition in certain areas I allowed the cutter to stay in one place long enough to burn the surface of the timber .  This gives lines of shadow under belts ,  etc

Colour refers to the actual wavelengths of the light rays concerned and determines the hue  ( redness ,  blueness ,  etc )  ,  which can be bright or dull ,  muted or full .  Most timber colours are of somewhat muted hues and generally very subtle  ( though not often dull )  ,  but can vary enormously from one another in tone value .  Much of the judgement used in choosing your veneers is instinctive , based on comparing <head>different</head> samples ; it comes from familiarity with woods and an innate colour sense . I suggest two points to bear in mind .  The first is to try to achieve a combination in which the tones of the different parts of the design are sufficiently distinct to read clearly one from another but do not display too violent tonal contrasts ,  unless a particularly dramatic effect is part of your aim !

Clearly artists working in several media have a wide range of references .  The art critic is thus bound to consider with care what standards of comparison should be used .  In the late twentieth century artists working in performance pose <head>difficulties</head> for the critic , though some observers find it refreshing rather than troublesome to consider work beyond the easel picture and the individual sculpture . In sum ,  then ,  the monograph is a major site for art critical writing ,  and ,  moreover ,  the place where the most extended criticism is likely to appear .  The reader may be disappointed by the standard of what is written ,  but unlike other sites of criticism ,  this cannot be attributed to the form of publication ,  only to the limitations of the author .

It was Roger Fry 's  contention that an object ,  say a bunch of carrots on a market stall ,  could be viewed in a practical way as something to eat for supper ,  or aesthetically .  This distinction can be backed up by philosophy and aesthetics ,  and descriptions can be found of the resultant moments of vision or epiphanies .  Our concern , however , is not with the <head>difficulties</head> of aesthetics , but only with what a critic writes of aesthetic experience , and how useful such an account may be . This is an aspect of description ,  while it can be suggested that other religious ,  political or social concerns are more properly matters of interpretation .  Unfortunately it is often the case that writers do not allow themselves  to be so free in autobiographical disclosures as to say exactly how they felt on seeing some work of art .

Yet within the context of organized literary study , it is true that much of the <head>difficulty</head> students have in making sense of texts comes from a lack of information , or to use the older term , a deficiency in general knowledge . As a scholar and theorist ,  Hirsch is known ,  apart from his unfashionable but vigorously argued advocacy of intentionalism ,  for his conviction that literature is not a coherent concept ,  and has no definable essence ,  and that by extension English as a discipline has no absolute method .  He believes that literary study has a cultural and humane rather than an intellectual value ;  and the implication of his recent work is that there are other ways of attaining cultural value .

I believe profoundly in all these things , it goes without saying ; my <head>difficulty</head> lies in knowing how defensible they are in the form in which they are visibly institutionalized in the anglophone academy . My reflections are not encouraging ,  though they are not altogether negative .

There is an interesting story behind the SuperCut woodcarving disc for angle grinders .  It has been launched by Toolbox of Sweden in direct competition to the Arbortech Woodcarver ;  the principle of both tools being to imitate the action of chainsaw teeth ,  but in a safer ,  more versatile manner .  Arbortech did so by developing a stamped <head>disc</head> with a tooth shape that differs from the chainsaw , to make sweeping cuts possible . Its inventor Kevin Inkster started with a loose chain on a disc ,  and it is this formation that Toolbox have chosen .  This move has been promoted as a safety measure ,  permitting slip when the tool bites ,  but the legalities of patent law were doubtless considered when Toolbox decided to manufacture their version .

Applying the 1.6kg tool to metalwork proved easy ,  even for the inexperienced .

This is a waltz for two violins and double - bass composed for the violinist 's  22nd birthday in 1853 by an uncharacteristically unbuttoned 20 - year - old Brahms ,  under the pseudonym Gioseppo .  Today I suppose he 'd have written variations on Happy Birthday ,  but this is more fun .

The shell is preserved in calcite ,  with a limestone infilling .  The topmost whorls of the shell are broken off .  this is a very ancient snail with a flat nearly <head>disc</head> like form , with fine growth lines and occasional courser knobs . The outer perimeter carries a raised ridge .  Gastropods of this kind are typical of Ordovician and Silurian strata ,  where there are a number of genera and many species of comparable form .

The children were at work at an early age teasing and cleaning the fleece with carders ,  wooden bats with sharp teeth ,  to remove tangles and impurities .  Before the spinning wheel came into use ,  much later in the North than in the South of England ,  all spinning was done on a spindle .  A wooden rod was placed through the centre hole of a whorl or <head>disc</head> made of wood or stone . Then the rod was twisted by the spinner ,  who pulled strands out from the fleece ,  allowing them to twist into thread by the action of the revolving spindle .  When a long length had been spun ,  it was wound onto the rod of the spindle ,  and the process was repeated .

Experiments in Paris involving transmission by telephone lines date back to 1881 ,  but it needed the technology of the 1930s to record two channels with adequate fidelity ,  synchronization and separation .

These were followed on later dates by other experimental recordings .  As far as we know ,  they all used two or three microphones spaced some yards apart along the front of the orchestra ,  a technique favoured by American engineers to this day .

But before tape came along ,  the record industry came up with one more development  full frequency - range recording .  The idea of a recording system covering the full range perceived by the human ear dates back to 1925 ,  when Brunswick claimed their electrical recordings covered the range from 16Hz to 21000Hz  ( 19 )  .  However , surviving <head>discs</head> show the upper limit was more like 4000Hz , inferior to Western Electric 's 4500Hz . By 1934 the highest frequency which  could reliably be recorded had reached 8000Hz .  In 1940 the British Decca Company was asked by RAF Coastal Command if it could record frequencies up to 14000Hz ,  almost the limit of human hearing .

There was no impetus to develop anything more sophisticated than a spoken announcement or a separate piece of paper packed into the box .  This means that many cylinder records surviving today have highly dubious provenances ,  as we shall see later .  It is debatable whether it was the cylinder or the <head>disc</head> that was the first to have a formal label physically attached . At the 1890 Convention of Local Phonograph Companies in Chicago ,  delegates asked for a longer cylinder with a section specifically set aside for an announcement ,  but this did not come about .  The following year there was a visit to the Edison works at West Orange ,  where the delegates saw prerecorded cylinders made by an experimental moulding process .

Many of the interiors created by the designers of such facilities are as forbidding as the old - fashioned spit - and - sawdust pub ;  any lingering atmosphere is swept away in a barrage of stained wood and fake Victoriana ,  and any casual visitors made to feel inordinately guilty if they do not ,  alas ,  wish to eat .

More important in some eyes is the difficulty of access .  Total journey time to a Rockies resort can exceed 24 hours if your itinerary involves connecting flights .  When combined with the need to acclimatise to life at 3,000m ( at Breckenridge or Copper Mountain , for example ) , the after - effects of a journey like this can <head>eat</head> into precious holiday time . Seekers after Alpine charm may or may not be content with the neo - Tyrolean style of Vail ;  they may or may not adapt to the Wild West clapboard houses of resuscitated mining towns such as Breckenridge .  But they will certainly be disappointed by the style of Rockies skiing above valley level .

Eliot traces the line further back into primitive prehistory by an explicatory aligning of his protagonist and a putative ancestor ,  the Cyclops ,  who devoured Odysseus 's  comrades .  When Nausicaa meets Polypheme beauty meets the beast .  It is also the meeting of the cultured city dweller , who led Odysseus from undergrowth to city palace , with the savage Cyclops who wished to <head>eat</head> the hero in a cave . The absurd encounter represented in Eliot 's  parenthesis is erotic ,  but also cannibal ,  each aspect reinforcing the outrageous horror - comedy of the other. The situation and its elements foreshadow the later confrontation of Sweeney and Doris on their cannibal isle .

Stephen Stich  ( 1983 )  presents a case for a syntactic theory of mind which is more radical than Fodor 's  .  He argues that the language of folk psychology  ( talk about beliefs ,  desires and the like )  may float free of the kind of mental states that actually do the computational work :  these are defined solely by their syntax and causal role ,  not by their reference .  He spends a lot of time saying why this way of regarding syntactic mental states does not <head>encounter</head> the problem of the holism of the mental . 2 .  This means the process of assigning syntactic roles to elements of a sentence :  noun phrase ,  prepositional phrase ,  adverb ,  etc.

One way of dealing with these problems is to run off a standard pro - forma ,  to fill in the blank spaces and send them off to parents .  This may well seem to be the most efficient way of utilising office time but when it comes to weighing up effectiveness the pro - forma is a non - starter as parents are antagonised by this bureaucratic and impersonal style of communication .

In all cases students taking a course  ( which is usually either a two - year diploma course or a one - year course )  are expected to return to their country on completion of training .  Students can also apply from any part of the world ,  and audition in the UK ,  but need to remember that a high standard of fluency in the English language will be expected .  There will always be problems when working with an English vernacular text using cockney or other dialects , but students from overseas have to <head>expect</head> to take this in their stride ( and usually do ) . Undoubtedly one of the best ways the overseas student has of seeing what is required in British theatre training is to apply for one of the summer schools offered by the drama schools ,  and find out what it 's  all about before committing him -  or herself to a long and expensive stay .  It 's  important that a student is prepared to understand and work with the prevalent theatrical traditions in UK schools .

Research in the police ,  Irving further asserts ,  is a matter of pragmatics ,  eliminating philosophical enquiry into systems of belief ,  or how the knowledge of an ideology is transformed into action .  In the end ,  only the action is viable ,  so that all these essays tend to match the inside ethnography and are nullified by neglect or have any contentious matter treated as privileged information ,  for as Templeton  ( 1980 :  904 )  argues the police fear that if you have a better understanding of society ,  you are in a better position to change it  the very exercise they are reluctant to engage in .  Those who do go public are disloyal and there are thinly veiled attempts to dismiss the value of any revelation they make , for they are <head>expected</head> to remain silent and uncritical . When Ronald Gregory ,  the ex - chief constable of West Yorkshire ,  said little or nothing new about the Yorkshire Ripper case in a series of newspaper articles ,  he was castigated in Police Review   ( 1 July 1983 )  and they republished a 1979 photograph of him when his loyalty was unquestioned .  John Alderson ,  the ex - chief constable of Devon and Cornwall has suffered even more from his subsequent public persona ,  because of a move into academia ,  some critical publications ,  and a flirtation with the political life .

And so the words turned back on themselves ,  phrases reappeared ,  seeming to confirm other phrases ,  merely repeating themselves ,  clicking into place with a semblance of logic which nicely disguised the truth that all these words were nothing but a glittering fabric which hovered above the ground ,  unwinding endlessly ,  slipping between the fingers ,  beguiling like a mirage ,  taking on whatever shape the conjuror wanted ,  and leading nowhere .

It originally closed to freight traffic on 14 May 1984 .  One worrying aspect concerning the reopening of freight lines to passengers is that invariably where such revivals have taken place ,  BR has badly underestimated the level of business .

This figure was rapidly exceeded and by 1989 was carrying one million passengers annually ,  necessitating lengthening platforms at several stations along its route at a cost of 60,000 .  Worthy of mention in this review of closures and revivals is the widely applauded reprieve by Chris Green ,  director of Network SouthEast ,  of London 's  Marylebone station on 30 April 1986 .

Venturi was a university teacher ,  son of a famous father ,  Adolpho Venturi ,  who had made a substantial contribution to the publication of documents of Italian art .  Venturi 's  survey started with classical times ,  the uncertainties of writing by Xenocrates ,  lists of lost works such as the treatise by Apelles ,  and settled down to comment on  two fundamental categories of criticism ,  the lives of artists ,  and the critic 's  encounter with the work of art .  For the latter he quoted a sentence by Lucian , the second - century Greek rhetorician : A work of art requires an intelligent spectator who must go beyond the pleasure of the eyes to <head>express</head> a judgement and to argue the reasons for what he sees . For Venturi ,  an important development in art criticism came in the eighteenth century which saw the foundation of aesthetics and the rise of philosophies for which art was an indispensable ingredient .  Writing as he was in the 1930s ,  he expressed his pleasure at the extensive documentation and reference material available to the student of art ,  instancing the growth of libraries and art historical teaching .

Those who feel hostile to much recent literary theory but are unwilling or unable to formulate their objections often lazily dismiss it as merely another Parisian fashion ,  citing the rapid displacement or structuralism by poststructuralism as evidence that the writings or Barthes ,  Derrida ,  Lacan and their American epigones constitute a craze rather than a serious intellectual movement .  There may be some justification for the  ( insular )  suspicion that when the Emperor is restocking his wardrobe he usually shops in Paris ;  but the rashionability or ideas does not or itself constitute an honest argument against them ;  indeed ,  to offer this as one 's  main response is to betray intellectual bankruptcy .  It is less easy , but more interesting , to try to understand why ancient radical doubts about the ability or language to <head>express</head> a genuine extra - linguistic reality have been revived in recent decades to the point where they seem to have achieved an almost popular appeal . Tallis sets himself the task of showing that much of the structuralist and poststructuralist enterprise is based on a misreading of Saussure .  Two aspects of Saussure 's  thought that have become well established in popular - academic consciousness are the distinctions between  ( a )  langue  and parole  ,  a language - system and its particular manifestations ;  and  ( b )  signifier and signified .

( I am about to re - read Celebration to see whether Dr Spufford ever really suggests any such thing .  )  We are saved through the loving obedience of Jesus which is not just a mental state but is <head>expressed</head> and only could be <head>expressed</head> in bodily pain and death . The world is redeemed because of the sanctity of this man Jesus ,  because of the love for his Father and for his sisters and brothers which made him totally accept his mission from the Father .  He was sent to be ,  commanded to be ,  the first completely human being ,  the first to be wholly at one with the human race ,  to be ,  therefore ,  wholly at risk from us ,  to be the victim ,  the scapegoat on whom we could project our guilt and our fear of being human ,  of being loved .

A private West German television company ,  SAT 1 ,  will pay more than 5.2m per year to broadcast the tournament and other ATP events in Germany ,  and the mayor of Frankfurt ,  Dr Volker Hauff ,  has promised to showcase the event with a week of concerts ,  exhibitions and international symposiums .

He <head>expresses</head> scepticism about Frankfurt 's boast of being able to fill their stadium for every session : I do n't think they will get 9,000 every day , but I would have achieved that here , where we have developed an audience for the game .

It is not like Hamburg ,  where they have had a tournament for a hundred years and people would go out and watch tennis at 7 am ,  even in the freezing cold .

His explanation for this defeat in the leadership elections  -  that some right - wing MPs voted for Michael Foot in order to justify their subsequent defection to the SDP  looks fanciful to say the least .  But his failure represents a great lost opportunity to have avoided both the damaging interlude of the SDP and the antics of the loony left which kept Labour out of the office for a decade .  He twice turned down the chance to become Secretary General of Nato , and the ideas on defence and deterrence outlined here compare favourably with much of the output of the Beltway Bandits and their fellow theorists in Paris or Moscow , save only that they are more readably <head>expressed</head> . The prospectus for the Nineties with which his book concludes is a thoughtful text which could with benefit be read by anyone interested in foreign affairs .

September 's  7.6 per cent inflation rate follows one of 7.3 per cent in August and compares with a current peak of 8.3 per cent in May .  Although inflation in October is expected to decline to around 7.2 per cent ,  because a 1.25 per cent increase in mortgage rates in October last year will drop out of the annual comparison ,  the recently announced increases in mortgage rates will send inflation back up again in November .  Economists yesterday <head>expressed</head> concern that the increase in prices was becoming more generalised . Excluding the impact of mortgage rates ,  regarded as the best guide to the underlying trend ,  inflation rose 0.1 points to 5.8 per cent in September ,  which suggests that high interest rates have yet to subdue inflation significantly .  But there was little reaction to the news in the London market .

A problem with this point of view is that there is in fact no evidence of descent groups having ever  existed without these two levels and it seems difficult to treat all documented cases as transitions from a stage for which there is no evidence .  In any case ,  the contradiction which Marx stresses very largely disappears when we realize that it is a matter of the context in which claim to land is expressed .  From the point of view of the outsider the descent group appears as undifferentiated and this will be <head>expressed</head> by statements of the commonality of the resources of claim while , from the point of view of the insider dealing with other insiders the descent group appears highly differentiated . There is however an implied point in the discussion of the gens which ,  I believe ,  is justified in all societies principally organized by descent group  ( though not necessarily all societies where descent groups merely occur as one among many other social institutions )  .  In such societies one does not find internal differentiation based on differential wealth ,  and if such differentiation appears to develop ,  it is resisted .

The case for Merz ,  Pistoletto and Buren may be different ,  but it is not unreasonable to expect a rationale for the proclaimed indebtedness of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art to the Situationists .  Nowhere in these publications are these connections argued for :  they are merely dogmatically asserted .  Given the withering contempt <head>expressed</head> by the Situationists for prositus , one shudders to think what Debord et al . are going to make of the quasi - situationists discovered in America by Elisabeth Sussmann .  On the basis of her understanding ,  it appears that any artist in the USA who uses the conventions of the mass media in such a way as to produce a critique of the media  ( and I can think of a good many )  is veritably a quasi - situationist .

Protestant opposition to integrated schooling is sometimes heard in the North ,  particularly from the fundamentalist camp ,  who not only fear catholic infiltration of state schools but are opposed to anything other than Bible protestantism in religious education .  But usually the opposite is the case and popular protestant support for integration is expressed .  perhaps if integrated schooling were more widespread in the North , more protestant voices would be <head>heard</head> against it , particularly if there was a possibility that a nun or priest might show up as a teacher in such an integrated school . There is also evidence of hardline evangelical indoctrination by some protestant teachers in state schools .  In addition ,  Roman catholic schools in Ireland ,  in continuity with the belief and practice of Roman catholics in a number of other countries ,  have a different concept and practice of teaching religion in the schools from that of the majority of protestant traditions .

A successful description of a self - portrait may not be difficult ,  but an illuminating interpretation may call on many references ,  especially other artists '  pictures of themselves .  What can be deduced from a self - portrait is often controversial ;  a critic is especially likely to read into a self - portrait some opinion held about the artist .  When , as in the cases of Rembrandt and Van Gogh , there is a whole series of pictures to choose from , books can be written on the self - <head>images</head> of one artist alone . This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's  writing ,  since it tempts the rash into speculation ,  while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons .  A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .

She feels  imperialized ,  that everything familiar to her is being disturbed ,  the peace is being disturbed ,  and that our ways of telling  ( form )  and what we have to tell  ( content )  are simply not something that should be on an agenda of any kind .  Which is interesting because here the three of us are ,  thinking about what it means to belong somewhere ,  what it might mean to belong to this idea called theatre .  And we are discovering that we are not interested in exploring the finer points of alienation with tea cuppery , but that the theatre can be a bridge of bone between sickness and health that our language will somehow always be on the edge of poetry and that <head>image</head> and metaphor are our natural tools they best express whole worlds and histories in collision with each other.

When wider bandwidth networking became available ,  the ability to move graphical information quickly around a network brought the cental multi user processor concept into the wimps era ,  and this has required clearly defined standards for the Graphical User Interface  ( GUI )  .

It is largely based on the bit <head>image</head> approach , and assumes a resolution of around 100 pixels per inch , which could become a limitation in the future . However ,  X is very widely supported ,  and is associated with the Unix operating system and the move to open standards in the IT industry .

The real problem is that the writers of such texts may make political difficulties within a department ,  or teach in ways difficult for students to understand .

At a time when a good public <head>image</head> is essential for universities , English is unable to explain itself in ways immediately intelligible to the outsider , is notoriously riven with doubts and disagreements that prevent it from having a shared sense of purpose , and may at intervals erupt into crises that attract the wrong sort of publicity .

In fact the original eighteen poems of the Hardy sequence ,   ( in the Collected Poems  of 1919 ,  he damagingly extended it by three extra pieces )  tell a story of the poet 's  pilgrimage to his and Emma 's  early haunts ,  matching the stages of the journey there and back to specific stages of Aeneas 's  journey ,  in Aeneid  6 ,  to the abode of the blest .  It thus represents ,  on the part of the supposedly non - modernist Hardy ,  a stratagem often taken to be definitively modernist :  the use of an ancient fable to structure and resonate with a twentieth - century narrative ,  as the Odyssey  structures and resonates with James Joyce 's  Ulysses  .  Yet so firmly established is the <head>image</head> of Hardy as a rustic provincial that Virgil rates not a single entry in the index to J.O . Bailey 's  700 - page Poetry of  Thomas Hardy ,  A Handbook and Commentary  ,   ( University of North Carolina ,  Chapel Hill ,  1970 )  .  Hardy undoubtedly read Virgil in the original ;  yet we know that long before he taught himself Latin his remarkable mother gave him  ( on his eighth birthday )  a copy of Dryden 's  translation of the Aeneid  .

The supernatural is as numbed as the natural :  equipped with microphone headsets and miniature televisions ,  the witches are played as suave technocrats ,  moving among humanity with invisible malice ,  sometimes doubling as murderers .  Only in the language  spoken with clarity throughout ,  especially by Simon Tyrrell as Macbeth ,  and Peter Granger - Taylor as Ross  does any slight consolation remain .  Across ashen , unredeemable scenes , Shakespeare 's words resound with redoubled force and humanity ; they sound almost ironic , in their fruitless reaching towards the <head>images</head> and emotions which have drained away from a soulless , monochrome universe . There are times when this universe seems excessively ,  even arbitrarily ,  bleak .

Those policemen who have racist views are faced with problems when the hero on celluloid is black ,  but when discussing such an instance ,  one policeman expressed his dislike for blacks but still found the film brilliant  ( FN 9/10/87 ,  p. 57 )  .

Sensitivity to public relations is not a quality which accompanies the Rambo self - <head>image</head> , and sergeants sometimes avoid placing the policemen who live out this imagery in situations where their insensitivity can damage public perceptions of the police . Various studies have shown that the public evaluate the police in terms of the attitude the police show them when they are victims in need of police help  ( for example ,  Jones 1983 ;  Maguire 1982 ;  Shapland 1982 ;  Southgate and Ekblom 1984 )  .  It is not always possible for low - ranking officers to anticipate the situations which Action Men need to avoid ,  and some instances were observed where the aggressive manner of the policeman acted as a form of amplification of deviance  ( Young 1971 )  ,  transforming a minor situation into big crime .

The most <head>important</head> thing is your firm knowledge that the selection is within your present range .

Finding characters for yourself will ,  1 think ,  depend a good deal on your personal taste in theatre at the time you are auditioning .

The question of accent is <head>important</head> too you need to be confident of the accent with which you are working , and it is always advisable to present an accent you are familiar with or at least can work with comfortably .

And do n't let your search for material lead you to choose the obscure for obscurity 's  sake ,  so you feel you will be sure to stun the panel with a piece that has no good professional background .

He concentrated on it because he loved it ,  and he thereby proved  once more his extreme simplicity of character .  For he had revealed one of the eternally popular effects of nature ,  one which is still quoted by simple people as a standard of visual beauty .  Animals make up a category of painting with an uneven reputation , though the theme is one of obvious importance and <head>interest</head> in sculpture . Animal Painting in Britain  was the title of a book by Basil Taylor ,  where he explained in his first chapter that the topic had been neglected since it was either assumed to be about sporting pictures ,  or about pictures of horses by such specialists as Sartorius .  He quoted the dismissive comment of the writer of the volume on British Painting 15301790  in the Pelican History of Art  :  To discuss the Sartorius tribe and such painters is no business of the historian of art ,  no matter how bitter the accusations of neglect are wont to be from those specialist writers who sometimes confuse the history of art with praising famous horses .

The collaboration of artists with the stage was also brought to a high point by Serge Diaghilev ,  in his commissions to artists for the Russian Ballet .

Critics no less than artists have wide <head>interests</head> in the arts , and may introduce comparisons in their interpretations . In the nineteenth century to say that a picture was poetic was a common term of praise .  In the present century emphasis on formal qualities in the visual arts have made musical comparisons more frequent ,  emphasised by the use by artists of musical terminology ,  as when Kandinsky chose to call his works Improvisations and Compositions .

In particular the protestant bloc lost the Southern protestant landowning gentry .

The two societies gave expression to their own dominant <head>interests</head> as far as possible unhindered by each other 's interference . The process was assisted in the North by the self - exclusion of Britain from internal Ulster affairs by setting up the Stormont parliament which survived from 1922 to 1972 .  Protestant  loyalist domination ,  successor to the ascendancy ,  was circumscribed to one corner of Ireland while the catholic  nationalist alliance asserted total domination in the remainder .

Added upset came in the same year from a speech by Dr W. Starkie ,  the commissioner of National Education in Ireland ,  who attacked school managers for not being up to their job .  The attack was within the context of a speech largely praising the Roman catholic church in Ireland .  But the church 's clerics still took offence , particularly at the point that local people should be encouraged to take an <head>interest</head> in the schools by having some financial responsibility for them through local government . As priests controlled the local school directly ,  this was seen to be a direct attack on their role in the school system .  Eventually the Irish party was forced to return to Westminster to see to it that the appropriate denominational interests in England were strengthened and to show the Irish political leadership 's  compliance with the similarly organized Irish system  ( Miller 1973 :  7785 )  .

The total of those favouring denominational schooling in the initial survey was less than one - third .

Alternatively ,  from another perspective ,  the clergy had acted to preserve the old divisions .  Unfortunately ,  the one is an inevitable corollary of the other.

( ibid .  22 )  In succumbing to the temptation of subjectivism  ( ibid .  23 )  ,  she recognizes that it becomes impossible to put any distance between oneself and the native ,  or more importantly between oneself and oneself in such a situation .

Non - evaluative criticism ,  as propounded by the successive Merton professors ,  Gardner and Carey ,  has long been a popular ideal at Oxford .  But another Oxford professor ,  John Bayley ,  sees things differently .  Discussing a book on Dostoevsky , he remarks that while the author has much of <head>interest</head> to say about The Idiot she does not quite persuade one that it comes off , indeed she does not really try , because like many scholars today she is more concerned with showing how the thing works than with judging if it works well . From the beginning academic literary study was divided between those who saw it as inevitably involved with making judgements and those who did not. Cambridge English represented the former :  Richards and Leavis wanted an evaluative criticism ,  because they did not believe that literature was simply a matter of disinterested individual response ;  it was an index to the condition of civilization ,  which made judgements imperative .

What better inspiration could a literature of theory have than an audience composed of theorists and critics ?  This is not ,  I think ,  meant to be ironical ,  and it represents a quite logical development from the premiss that the whole production ,  definition ,  and reception of literature has now become intramural to the academy .  In this context , what goes on outside , what is actually written by poets and novelists , is of minor <head>interest</head> . Paul de Man is reported to have said that a  literary work is merely an event in the history of interpretation .  A natural response to this state of affairs would be to say that theory cut off from the writing of literature is no more than a sterile academicism .

It is shrewd of Mr Kinnock to attempt to enlist this mood and to link Labour with such concepts as patriotism ,  efficiency and plain common sense ,  virtues which have more often been associated with the Conservative Party. Similarly ,  it is shrewd of him to play for the internationalist vote after a prolonged period of sullen Little Englandism during which Labour threatened to withdraw from the Common Market and called into question this country 's  role within Nato .  Increasingly the Prime Minister is regarded by many swing voters as unconstructive and isolationist rather than a determined defender of British <head>interests</head> . She ,  and not Mr Kinnock ,  is constantly at odds with the European Community and the Commonwealth .  A stance which was appropriate for the Age of Brezhnev and Galtieri now seems out of date and out of touch with the spirit of the times .

The rule dealt with persons who had the same interest in any proceedings .  It made no express reference to proceedings between a named representative of a class and a member of that class who might well have sharply different interests ,  as betweeen themselves ,  as to the substance of the plaintiff 's  claim .  Paragraph 5 referred simply to enforcement of a <head>judgment</head> or order against a person who , under the rule , was bound by it . It did not purport to enlarge the class of persons who might enforce the judgment or order and there was no basis for attributing any such intention or effect .  There was no reason to suppose that in proceedings under Order 5 ,  rule 5 ,  it was intended to enable a named representative defendant to claim against a member of the represented class without complying with the requirements of the county court rules .

And now we have come up before the beak for a second wigging ,  because on the application of  one of our own citizens we are accused of degrading treatment or punishment inflicted in the Isle of Man .  It is impossible to exaggerate the revolutionary significance of the recognition of a binding judicial tribunal external to the realm .  There is no similarity between this and international arbitration , where a state voluntarily agrees in a particular case to accept the <head>judgment</head> of a tribunal , as two individuals might freely agree to accept the adjudication of an arbitrator . International arbitration is no more a transfer of sovereignty than private arbitration is an ousting of the jurisdiction of the courts .  The European Convention is different in kind ,  and the British signatories of it ,  worthy predecessors to the signatories of the Treaty of Brussels in 1972 ,  put an end to a period of more than four centuries during which no causes have been carried out of this realm .

The consequences strike at the right of the people of this country to live under the laws made and altered by their representatives in Parliament .  This ceases to be possible where a document accepted as binding is bindingly interpreted by an external court .  In order to arrive at its findings , the European Commission does what no court in this country can do , namely sit in <head>judgment</head> upon the policy and justification of an Act of Parliament . What is more ,  and equally incompatible with our conception of parliamentary democracy ,  the judicial interpretation of the terms of such a document as the Convention is not susceptible to statutory control or modification .  In the system to which the European Convention belongs ,  the judiciary are the legislators ,  and their powers as such are the more sweeping because of the necessarily vague and general terms in which the socalled human rights are defined .

Interest rates would have to be higher and there is a risk that a Labour government facing difficult choices would be tempted to devalue sterling ,  as feared by financial markets .

The report makes no <head>judgment</head> on Labour 's tax plans . However ,  it argues that VAT increases will be required whichever party is in power if public borrowing is to be reduced .  Implicit in this analysis is the view that Labour would have little scope for raising additional revenue by further increases in income tax directed at the better - off .

The author started his career in the Victoria and Albert Museum ,  where there is an important group of this sculpture ;  his book had a double origin in a museum exhibition and a series of lectures .

Their work will require strict adherence by the dancers to a distinctive style of dance and gesture ,  which is designed to communicate thoughts ,  moods ,  emotions and actions as the plot ,  theme or dance unfolds .  They insist that there must be no deviation from that style and demand such loyalty that their dancers <head>lose</head> their own identity and become absorbed in the world of that particular ballet .

The Possessed looked for a long time like <head>losing</head> its way , and Dostoevsky would surely concede that in so far as the design was , to use his own word , tendentious , this was bound to be so . And yet a novel does n't write itself ,  even if some of the very greatest ones appear to ;  it is written by a man with aims and preferences .  But these just happen to be his ,  he ca n't prescribe them for art ;  what he wants to say must come to terms with what the form allows him ;  art refuses to be imposed upon ,  to be dictated to ,  and Dostoevsky 's  dictum will stand .

Hora e sempre   this motto is inscribed on the front of Hawksmoor 's  ,  the real Hawksmoor 's  ,  Classical house at Easton Neston in Northamptonshire :  Easton Neston has been reputed or imagined to be the original of Mansfield Park ,  which may be described as a house imagined by an opponent of the Gothic novel .  The motto refers to a dynastic permanence ;  but it could be stolen for this novel ,  where a now and always is on show .  We may be <head>meant</head> to think that time is simultaneous , in a way that may owe something to the simultaneity propounded , perhaps , in Eliot 's Four Quartets , where History is now and England ; or that it is cyclical , a turning wheel , with human depravity paling into insignificance as the wheel turns into modern times . Interpretation is allowed to copy what it finds ,  and to distort it ,  and it may be that the novel can be interpreted as an entertainment which conveys that doctrines of science and improvement ca n't encompass what happens in a frightening world ,  where motive is dark and ill - will ubiquitous .  The Gothic novel was shaped to take account of such a world ,  and to do so ,  very often ,  in the guise of entertainment .

It will be the same story for many moons to come .  Most of the drama schools now include a presentation of auditions for agents and managements at the end of the final term ,  in addition to the finals productions .  This <head>means</head> that students then have the chance to present themselves as they would at a working audition , and this is often quite a good place to attract attention . Although an agent may be very impressed by the talent he sees ,  there are practical difficulties which affect how much agents can do for young actors .  The whole thorny question of Equity membership is linked with the step from drama school to agent 's  office  and indeed applies equally at the audition for the first job .

In 1939 ,  for instance ,  in an obituary of Ford for The Nineteenth Century and After  ,  he had written of the stilted language that then passed for good English in the arthritic milieu that held control of the respected British critical circles ,  Newbolt ,  the backwash of Lionel Johnson ,  Fred Manning ,  the Quarterlies and the rest of em .  And this echoed a letter of 1937 to Michael Roberts ,  extolling Ford and saying ,  The old crusted lice and advocates of corpse language knew that The English Review  existed .  In Ezra Pound : The Image and the Real , Herbert Schneidau reasonably enough names three of the crusted lice as Henry Newbolt , Frederic Manning , and G.W. Prothero , and with a proper scrupulousness he <head>notes</head> that all these were treated with great deference in Pound 's early letters and writings . Schneidau follows Pound 's  own broad hints by tracing his gradual alienation or liberation from these early admirations according as Ford 's  demands for a prosaic strength in verse writing gradually won Pound over from the Wardour Street language of his own early poems  ( such as Canzone :  The Yearly Slain '  written in reply to Manning 's  Kor )  .  The story is an intricate one ,  as Herbert Schneidau acknowledges ;  and Pound 's  holding out against Ford for the Dantesque principle of a curial diction  ( see his introduction to the poems of Lionel Johnson )  represents to my mind an objection that can still be raised to Ford 's  principles of diction ,  salutary as Ford 's  polemics undoubtedly were for Pound at this time .

Given the particular disposition of the policeman or woman and the nature of the case ,  court duty can become an opportunity for them to have a good fight ,  and pleasure can be taken in getting one over the solicitor .  This also appears to be an attraction to members of British police forces .  Holdaway ( 1983 : 72 ) <head>noted</head> how lawyers were seen by Hilton 's police as a threat because they unmask police practice , and , along with doctors and social workers , they were considered challengers . This led some policemen to enjoy the sport which the court room offered  ( Holdaway 1983 :  74 )  .  In the case of policemen at Easton ,  this sport is situationally constrained by the common - sense knowledge they build up of the court room setting and its players .

Yet he is not to die : at the very last moment the image jumps slightly and then we <head>note</head> Custer 's singular absence at the centre of the famous circle , which at that moment begins to break up. Disappeared ,  literally ,  without a trace .  Obviously caused by a simple technical fault ,  this spiriting away of his death gave him a singular nobility totally lacking from the rest of the film .

If they are  including public - sector trade unions ,  local government ,  local authority schools and housing ,  and various quangoes  then they attract little sympathy and people have to be liberated from them .

It is also interesting to <head>note</head> how relations have worsened with a number of lite institutions which have been identified with paternalist and consensual values universities , the Church of England , the senior civil service , the BBC and One Nation Conservatism .

Even where a bituminous felt layer was laid on top of the boarding ,  this form of construction is likely to compound problems of rainwater penetration once a gap appears in the roof covering because the water which enters ,  instead of draining out of the construction at the eaves ,  settles on the upper edges of the local slate - fixing battens ,  inducing rot both in them and the boarding .  Equally bad from the point of view of damp exclusion in the circumstance of a breach appearing in the roof surface ,  and even worse in terms of the restrictions it places on the opportunities for salvaging slates in any wholesale reconditioning of the roof covering ,  is the arrangement in which the slates are nailed directly to boarding ,  no fixing battens having been incorporated .  If this form of construction cannot be identified from an inspection of voids in the roof surface made from the exterior , it may be possible to deduce whether or not it applies by <head>noting</head> the pattern of nails which have penetrated into the roof - space through the boarding . Such an inspection should also help to identify any dampness or rot which has affected the boarding .  Where such decay is well advanced ,  complete replacement of the roof cladding with a boarded ,  counterbattened and battened construction ,  including underslating felt and a new slated surface ,  may be required .

Left to its own devices ,  real ale stays in a drinkable condition for about a week .  When the pub landlord or cellarman considers that the beer is ready to serve  it is said to have dropped bright with the sediment of yeast in the belly of the cask ,  and to have matured sufficiently  a long plastic tube is connected to the tap and the beer is ready to be pulled to the bar .  The most familiar method of serving real ale is the beer engine , a simple suction pump <head>operated</head> by a tall handpump on the bar . When the handle is pulled the engine delivers a half pint of beer to the bar .  Some pubs ,  mainly in the Midlands and the North ,  use electric pumps to draw the beer to the bar .

It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have remained the province of the archbishop and his clergy .  The immediate result is that alongside a few major clerics such as Runcie and Jenkins ,  we find that Stalker ,  Sampson ,  Anderton ,  Alderson ,  Newman ,  Imbert ,  Dear ,  Oxford ,  and Hermon are national personalities ,  while a second division of chief officers regularly proclaim on a range of subjects which at other times would lie outside the province of the police .  Yet Robert Reiner ( 1989 ) , writing on the collective culture of chief constables , is the first to explore their extraordinary place in modern society , simply because as an lite among the powerful in society they have had little need to reveal how they <head>operate</head> , link together , or reveal what structures of significance guide their actions . Across the history of policing their need has always been for the light of research to illuminate the activities of the underprivileged and the powerless ,  rather than focus upon the lite themselves !  Analysis of police culture is therefore particularly suited to the anthropological method ,  for it requires an extended field study to reveal much about the unspoken agenda which determines many aspects of police practice .

It grew up originally in the Southern middle - class suburb of Dalkey ,  County Dublin ,  and around the Church of Ireland national school there .

The <head>organization</head> claimed membership from all parts of the South , and its membership contained education specialists , lawyers , people from the media , and civil servants , at least one of whom knew something of the existing channels of power and communication between church and state in the national school system .

In 1978 ,  on the basis of their professional knowledge of schooling and civil administration ,  the organization succeeded in obtaining the necessary government permission to open in Dalkey a multi - denominational school governed principally by the parents ,  the mode of religious instruction to be determined by them .

With hindsight it seems that the prevailing structures of police practice will remain as powerful as ever ,  for at a conference on policing at Bristol University  ( 1988 )  ,  the newly retired Sir Kenneth admitted that police culture had defeated many of his attempts to bring a new ethic to the managerial style during his reign as commissioner of the metropolis .  ANTHROPOLOGY FOR THE POLICE It seems relevant that anthropology be used at this time to contribute to the debate on policing , for since the 1964 Police Act and the preceding Royal Commission which was generated through concern over police practice , the <head>organization</head> has held an increasingly central place in the public imagination . Policing issues are never long out of the headlines  ( Chibnall 1977 )  ,  and this media obsession has been transmitted into a  wealth of analyses of policing  which have mostly been carried out by outside observers .  Indeed insider accounts have largely consisted of bland reminiscences in the style of my greatest arrests and cases and it has been left to investigative journalism to redress some unacceptable police activity ,  by calling attention to the limits and abuses of police authority ,  power ,  and accountability .

In 1979 ,  James Anderton ,  the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester ,  described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from seditionist interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy  ( Thompson 1979 :  380 )  .  In the light of such a polemic stand ,  it begs the question whether the revelation of how crime figures are manipulated by the police to sustain institutional beliefs  ( see Chapter 5 )  could be said to undermine democracy or be classified as sedition .  For Anderton vehemently rejects the idea of any internal evaluation which might explore the moralities or philosophies of policing : there is simply no room in the management and <head>organization</head> of police operations for vague , academic dissertations ( Police Review ; 90 , 19 November 1982 : 4684 ) . In his 1977 annual report ,  Sir David McNee ,  then commissioner of the Metropolitan Police ,  urged that the libertarian should beware .  In due course ,  his successor ,  Sir Kenneth Newman ,  echoed this anti - intellectual stance ,  when he warned insiders that policemen must remember that they are practitioners ,  not crusaders ;  theirs is to do ,  not to righteously philosophise  ( Police Journal  56 ,  No. 1  ( 1983 )  )  .

Nevertheless they were considerably more evangelical at the turn of the century than they are now .  The problem for the Free Presbyterians is that the fraternal orders have always seen themselves as linking the broad Protestant religious tradition with the main unionist party ,  hence the common arrangement of Orange Lodges holding their annual church parades at each of the Church of Ireland ,  Presbyterian ,  and Methodist churches in turn .  As the main churches have become more liberal , Free Presbyterianism emerged to challenge the lack of real Protestantism and hence offered an implicit challenge to the fraternal <head>organizations</head> to purify themselves by breaking their ties with the main , and now apostate , denominations . Ian Paisley was once a member of the Shankill Road Lodge of the Orange Order and a lodge chaplain ,  but he resigned from the Order when the County Grand Lodge refused to expel Sir Robin Kinahan for attending a funeral service in a Roman Catholic chapel .

The position and ideology of Ulster unionists is such that their goals cannot be divided .

The scope or character of a piece of criticism is naturally related to the magazine or newspaper in which it appears ,  as we noticed in the case of Dore Ashton 's  dismissal from the New York Times  because it was asserted that her work could not be understood by the paper 's  readers .  The first rule for a reader of articles is thus to find a sympathetic publication .  Some trial and error should eliminate the laziest <head>papers</head> , whose critics do no more than pillage catalogue introductions , or even press releases . Some latitude can be allowed to serious critics who write for periodicals which go to press a long time before a show is on view ;  these critics will not be able to comment on how the exhibition actually looks ,  as their articles will have been written before the show 's  installation .  They  nevertheless will have seen some ,  perhaps all the works included ,  and can thus comment usefully on the artist 's  standing ,  aims and achievements .

Webb et al  .

As it is , when I showed close colleagues my first working <head>paper</head> ( Young 1979a ) on experiences in a police bridewell ( see Chapters 2 and 3 ) , they were alarmed . I was told on more than one occasion ,  that I should not really let outsiders see this sort of thing ,  even though it was agreed that what I had written was an accurate analysis of events .  In some respects ,  I think it was the detail of the ethnographic thick description which most alarmed them ;  for as almost all of them wistfully pointed out :  it shows exactly how we do the business .

The Staff College should be a place where serving officers have the opportunity to contemplate society as a whole and in particular to study and consider those liberal and humane values which are central to our society .  The college should have as its prime concern the nurture of ethics and integrity ;  they are the core of any professions .  Such a proposal is now of another era , however , and I was present when an ex - Dean of Academic Studies at the college presented a <head>paper</head> ( Stead 1980 ) attacking the trend to expensive , amalgamated police units which had grown up in the previous two decades . The appetite for power these immense forces display worried Stead ,  and he argued their style could only lead to an autocratic national system with a minister of central government at the apex .  His fears seem to be well founded ,  for a move towards regionalization is now occurring ,  with a proposal that the forty - three forces disappear into perhaps eight or nine giant regional units .

It is this logic of practice which effectively negates most research and is perhaps the main reason that between 1979 and 1988 ,  only one of the research papers I have compiled has been looked at by senior officers .

Ours was now a multiple reality and our structural ambivalence can be illustrated by one example when one of the squad created a blazer badge in heraldic style  ( although we could never have been seen in a blazer at this time when faded denim was the order of the day )  .  This badge had crossed hypodermic syringes and a Latin motto which when translated ,  read :  Bodies in the cells ,  names in the papers .  The blazer badge reinforced the capture of bodies philosophy which had sustained our earlier lives , but was created at the same time that I was compiling a <head>paper</head> for presentation at the national BMA police surgeons ' conference . I believe they came to hear jolly conference stories about drug fiends and acid heads ,  but the paper concluded :  it would seem that the economics of the socially approved tobacco and alcohol industries means that we have to accept 42,000 deaths annually from cigarettes ,  and the cost to society of 50,000 alcoholics .

In the 1950s and 1960s the royal castles were examined in detail by various authorities ,  but it was the great baronial buildings in Wales that attracted King .  From the 1950s through to the early 1980s he published an important series of papers ,  the majority in the Cambrian Archaeological Association 's  Archaeologia Cambrensis ,  notably on the Pembrokeshire castles of Carew ,  Manorbier and Pembroke ,  and the native Welsh castles of Dinas Bran and Caergwrle in the north of the principality .

Its paper was to be presented to a Market Research Society seminar last March when ,  with three days '  notice ,  the health department instructed the authors to withdraw it .  It was cut out of conference papers and replaced with a notice slipped into the file saying :  The proposed paper on the Aids monitor has unfortunately had to be withdrawn ,  since it has not been possible to synchronise the publication with the Health Education Authority 's  own report on the 1988 data ,  expected in the near future .  The <head>paper</head> has still not been published . Fears that the Government was putting constraints on research it commissions were fuelled when ,  last year ,  the then DHSS inserted a new clause in its contract with outside researchers .  It said :  Any publication of research material ,  or of the results of research ,  or of matters arising from such material or results ,  is subject to the prior consent of the Secretary of State ,  which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld .

Edward Johnston 's  1915 sanserif lettering for the Underground still strikes an efficient modern note amidst the dirt and gloom .  Similarly the Faber book - jackets ,  designed by Berthold Wolpe in the 1960s employing his own typeface Albertus ,  convey a sense of literary energy and creativity .  So do the Gollancz wrappers of the 1930s and beyond with an audacious mixture of typefaces printed on glaring yellow <head>paper</head> . And at the moment you are reading a typeface called Dutch ,  a sharper version of Times New Roman .  Twentieth - century artists as diverse as Klee ,  Miro ,  Jackson Pollock and Mark Tobey ,  inspired by the apparent freedom of Oriental calligraphy ,  have invented new alphabets and made abstract art with letter shapes .

Heads of Department may then permit you time off in lieu .  There are fears of family life going down the drain ,  as staff may get only two complete weekends off in seven .  The talk is of bondage to the <head>paper</head> : under a highly restrictive contract . So what began ,  apparently ,  as an attempt to strengthen the weakest paper of the group has convulsed the main profit - earner .  Whether this is the start of a deliberate confrontation ,  or the result of bad management of the kind which provoked BBC staff to strike this summer there is every sign that Mr Black wants his staff on a far tighter rein .

While city leaders in Leipzig held talks with reformists ,  reports indicated that police in Halle had made a baton attack on about 3,000 people as they were leaving a church to march in silence round the town .

The 15 were later released .  There was a telling indication that the police and other forces who have to impose Communist rule were not immune to the general discontent .

In sharp contrast ,  three quarters of all newspaper readers said that the papers they had read on the day of the interview were biased in their coverage of the Conservative and Labour parties ,  though less than half said their papers gave biased coverage of the Alliance .

Roughly four - fifths of Sun ,  Express ,  Mail  ,  and Telegraph  readers said their paper was biased towards the Conservatives ,  while a similar number of Mirror  readers said their paper was biased against the Conservatives .  Somewhat fewer readers of the Star  and the Guardian saw a Conservative versus Labour bias in their papers though ,  on balance ,  they thought the Star  was pro - Conservative and the Guardian  anti - Conservative .

We aim to show in Chapter 5 that this blindness was in part promoted by the religious elements in their beliefs .  Secondly ,  there is the problem of the Northern catholic community ,  which tends to be taken as a monolithic nationalist community .  Apart from the fact that there has been significant support for the alliance <head>party</head> over the last dozen years or so among the catholic middle classes , there is also a further factor . Rose 's   ( 1971 )  survey ,  conducted in 1968 on the verge of the Troubles ,  found that as many as 30 per cent of the catholic population were explicitly prepared to endorse the constitution of Northern Ireland ,  which then included the Stormont parliament .  Catholics ,  however ,  did not vote for the Unionist Party.

The truth of the matter probably lies somewhere in between .  As Miller argues ,  there is a long tradition among the protestants of Ulster of viewing the British state ambiguously .  It is clear that in the past many of them have considered loyalty to be a two - way process , a contract or covenant , and that the state could be a traitorous <head>party</head> as well as the people . The tradition proved of crucial importance in forming the basis for the strategy of the alliance from 1911 until British recognition of their separate political claim in 1914 .  If the tradition still exists today  and it appears that it very much does so  it implies that the United Kingdom does not have for many loyalists a natural character of statehood in the way the Southern state has for catholic nationalists .

The new Ireland must be a society within which ,  subject only to public order ,  all cultural ,  political and religious beliefs can be freely expressed and practised .  This was made explicit in terms of the sense of British identity which protestant loyalists experience :  This implies in particular ,  in respect of Northern protestants ,  that the civil and religious liberties that they uphold and enjoy will be fully protected and their sense of Britishness accommodated  ( New Ireland Forum 19834 :  i .  223 )  .  For the very first time , the leadership of all the major constitutional nationalist <head>parties</head> in Ireland , representing 90 per cent of the nationalist population , had abandoned the concept of the tyranny of the majority will . The people of Ireland were not identified as the catholic  nationalist population .  There were still traces of ethnocentrism in the nationalist viewpoint elsewhere in the report :  for instance ,  they still referred to the historic integrity  of Ireland  ( New Ireland Forum 19834 :  i .  28 )  ,  implying an almost naturalistic concept of Irish unity ,  when as a political unit Ireland only ever existed as a British - administered territory .

On the one hand they subscribed to the annual Irish parliamentary party fund and ,  on the other ,  they publicly praised the Irish party as the true political representatives of the Irish people and its interests in the British parliament .  Even a Castle bishop such as Archbishop Healy ,  now announced his conversion to the nationalist cause .  In other words , support for the education policies of the church were the quid the Irish <head>party</head> had to give in order to obtain the quo of the bishops ' endorsement of the <head>party</head> as the genuine political representatives of the Irish people or nation . The agreement over education was so clear that when the first revolutionary Irish government set itself up in 1918 ,  prior to negotiated independence ,  there was no Minister for Education .  And when the Irish Free State did emerge in 1921 ,  practically the entire school system was under the control of the churches .

The burden of the message was that good catholic parents sent their children to catholic schools .

But there is strong support for sensible increases in public spending ,  provided this does not lead to massive hikes in taxation .

Fearful of protests or violence by citizens outraged by the army 's  brutal assault on Tiananmen on 4 June ,  armed troops cordoned off a large area of central Peking ,  admitting only hand - picked spectators into the square .  Among the guests were thousands of plain - clothes police and out - of - uniform soldiers ,  some of whom arrived in military trucks ,  dressed as clowns .

He maintained there was only one way to resolve differences within the party leadership over Labour 's  policy towards a privatised water industry :  Take water back without compensation .

But the SPD ,  instead of exuding the sort of assurance suggesting that the general election in December next year belongs to it ,  struggles to hide its edginess .  The party reacted with unnecessary embarrassment and defensiveness to government attacks on general talks it has been holding with the Greens ,  and its desire ,  as part of its traditional Ostpolitik ,  to press on with contacts with the Communist party in East Berlin despite the sudden surge of open opposition to the government by East German citizens .  Two impressive victories this year , in Berlin and in Frankfurt , producing municipal coalitions with the Greens , were a fillip for <head>party</head> morale . But at the European elections in June the SPD failed to break through despite heavy CDU losses .  The West German electorate lacks confidence in Chancellor Kohl and his team ,  but has yet to be convinced that the SPD ,  with whatever future coalition partner it chooses ,  will do much better .

PRESIDENT NAJIBULLAH of Afghanistan says he has no intention of resigning and the United States and Pakistan should accept reality and negotiate with him.

It is ridiculous that somebody should talk to a <head>party</head> and at the same time dictate to that <head>party</head> who should be heading it , he said in an interview with The Independent . He was replying to demands that he should resign to pave the way for talks between the Pakistan - based mujahedin resistance and Kabul 's  ruling Peoples Democratic Party  ( PDPA )  on a peace settlement .  The President said that if the United States and Pakistan were really serious in wishing to settle the Afghan problem they should acknowledge the new reality in Afghanistan ,  where seven months after the departure of Soviet troops the PDPA had become more united and strengthened ,  while the guerrillas were in total disarray .

By YING HUI TAN ,  Barrister An overseas company dealing in works of art which used premises in London for viewing and storing works of art and controlled access to a secure vault at the premises had an established place of business in Great Britain on the premises ,  although other works of art not belonging to the company were also on the premises and no outward sign of the company ,  such as a nameplate ,  was displayed on the premises .

I have been very lucky ;  the right opportunities have come along and yet every time you take them you are looking forward immediately to the next challenge .  I mean the most exciting moment of all is when you are actually chosen for a part  after that initial excitement it 's  a bit downhill  not because the work is n't marvellous but because the first challenge is the peak .  I think everyone needs the director to be vitally interested in the work well beyond the first week of actual <head>performance</head> . In the West End there seems at the moment a tendency to rely too much on the goodwill of actors which is often accompanied by a failure to maintain a true interest in what is going on for the actor .  Perhaps directors in particular need to realise how much their vitality means to the continuing performance  that it is n't enough to be left up on a stage merely doing it night after night .

The effects of rain on the stall Many pilots are unaware of the significance of dirty wing surfaces and of rain or drizzle on both the performance and the stalling characteristics of gliders .  Tests show that on most high <head>performance</head> machines , a spread of splattered flies on the leading edges can account for up to a quarter of the glider 's <head>performance</head> , reducing a glide ratio of 40 : 1 to less than 35 : 1 and making a mockery of glide calculations . This is so serious that for world championship flying ,  many gliders are now fitted with a means of cleaning off the leading edges of the wings in flight .  In light rain I have measured an increase of about 8 knots in the speed for the pre - stall buffet and stall of a K13 ,  although the stall itself did not seem to have changed in character .

It is alarming to hear how many relatively inexperienced pilots seem completely unaware of the risks they take when pitting their skills against the forces of nature .  They often think that if their flying is good enough ,  it is safe for them to press on in any weather conditions .  The <head>performance</head> of modern gliders makes it much easier and more likely for a pilot to fly himself into a potential death trap unless he uses his imagination or has already learned to have a healthy respect for the elements . The result has been a noticeable increase in the number of pilots who suddenly find themselves faced with a situation far beyond their control ,  usually a situation that they had not even considered at the start of the flight .  In most respects ,  using wave lift is far safer than cloud flying for attempts at Gold and Diamond heights .

The fourth picture shows a magnificent affair made by Paul Voigt ,  which had twin diaphragms and 20kilogauss field magnets .  It was possibly the first time the BBC had had to take other equipment out of service because someone ( Voigt ) complained of its bad <head>performance</head> , which had shown up on this speaker . If proof were needed of the new - found fascination with sound reproduction in the 1950s ,  the last picture should supply it .  It is of one of the unforgettable demonstrations by G.A .

Admittedly ,  conditions in the American academy are a little tighter than they once were ,  but what looks like stringency by American standards is still lavishness by British ones .  Britain can never hope to compete with all this .  Nevertheless , professionalism on American lines is still the ideal that academic administrators uphold , since it can indicate to sceptical politicians and the public at large that universities are engaged in the visible activity which generates <head>performance</head> - indicators . In this climate ,  the academic in English and other subjects in the humanities ,  who is busy ,  who publishes a lot ,  who goes to conferences ,  cannot but be preferred to the quiet scholar ,  who keeps a low profile ,  even seems rather idle ,  but is taking his time over a major piece of scholarly writing that may involve many years '  work and which he does not intend to give to the world until he is ready .  Such people have in the past been left to go their own way without interference .

The discussion may be restricted to impeccably intellectual topics ,  but the play of market forces is going on all the time just below the surface .  In one sense ,  everyone benefits from the buoyancy of academic book publishing .  The academic gets the publication record that leads to tenure or advancement , and his or her name becomes known in the profession ; the institution gains <head>performance</head> - indicators ; and the publisher keeps a full and interesting list . It is hard to speak against a situation that makes everyone happy ,  but one has to say it represents a form of intellectual inflation that is just as pernicious in its way as monetary inflation .  Far too many inferior or unnecessary academic books are published each year .

The County Arms at Blaby was subject to a proposal for theming as a Beefeater steakhouse some years ago ,  which was rejected by the local authority with support from the Thirties Society although the building is not listed .  More recently ,  the Prospect Inn was threatened by an enlargement scheme by Whitbread which would have totally destroyed the remaining original features of the building ,  and its remarkable plan .  Fortunately , the Thirties Society was able to get the Prospect listed in May 1990 , and alternative development <head>plans</head> are awaited . The Prospect Inn ,  which could be restored a major tourist attraction ,  is also threatened by a road widening proposal by Kent County Council ,  although the local authority ,  Thanet ,  understand its importance and value the building .  Road widening is an inevitable and current threat to many former roadhouses ,  such as the former Chez Laurie on the A299 near Herne Bay  ( W M Bishop ,  1936 )  .

The John Bull in Layerthorpe ,  York  ( B Wilson ,  1937 )  was a Tudor - style pub remarkable solely through having survived unaltered ,  but not listable simply on these grounds .  The needs of pub management in the 1980s have been hard to contain in pubs originally segregated into saloon and public bars ,  if not into further distinct spaces .   This has been the experience of the Thirties Society in fighting for the retention of the main <head>plan</head> features of the Nag 's Head , one of the few listed pubs of the period . Designed as a demonstration of bi - partite segregation between public and saloon ,  it lends itself poorly to unification ,  and the restorable public bar would have been lost in the process .  The Thirties Society negotiated a compromise scheme with the architects acting for Ind Coope which the owners found  unnacceptable  ,  threatening closure of the pub .

HO Circular  ( 194/78 )  describing British and American research literature on policing is another typically apologetic ,  anti - intellectual document ,  for within its first few paragraphs it admits :  the implication of attempting to establish a central research information centre to give advice to chief officers about research findings ,  or collect ,  collate and distribute research of interest to the police service ,  and maintain an up - to - date index of research would be very considerable .

The Full Plans method is the old system that has existed for many years ,  whereby detailed plans of your proposal are submitted in duplicate ,  along with an application form .  The plans are examined by the council for compliance with the Building Regulations ,  and if everything is in order you will receive an Approval Notice in due course ,  which you can then file away with your deeds .  The Building Notice procedure is a comparatively new system and does not require the submission of any detailed <head>plans</head> . With this method a simple form  ( Notice )  is deposited with your council ,  which gives brief details of the work you want to do .  Although no detailed plans are necessary ,  you will be required to provide a location plan showing the siting of your building ,  the boundaries of the site and particulars of any drainage works .

The plan to make unions responsible for unofficial action arose out of the strikes in the summer on the London Underground ,  where an informal group of drivers and guards led a long series of stoppages over pay .

Labour Party leaders , meanwhile , saw their <head>plan</head> for new industrial laws overwhelmingly endorsed at the party conference in Brighton .

Many drama schools regard musical productions as a main attraction ,  and shows such as Cabaret ,  Guys and Dolls  and Chicago  often get presented very well ,  with good choreography and musical direction which supports the cast very well .  The ability to sing and dance has become increasingly important in the profession nowadays ,  and there are few actors who do n't possess some musical and dance skills .  Productions such as Oh , What a Lovely War offer many opportunities for voice and body training to be displayed effectively , particularly as the quick character sketches in this show mean that an actor may <head>play</head> several parts in one evening . Press notices are ,  however ,  exceptionally rare these days. Once The Stage  covered all finals productions from the drama schools ,  but now they may write up a play perhaps once a year .

The second sentence of the issue of May 1988 refers to the first twenty years of the state :  Threatening to push the Jews into the sea ,  the Arab world reformulated the Nazi theory of Lebensraum  in Mediterranean terms :  there was no room in the region for a Jewish homeland .  Arabs who had been expelled from their land and thrust into the condition of Jewish refugees are hereby reformulated as imperialist aggressors and as Nazis .

Much of this is due to the face that ,  following the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on pub ownership ,  many breweries are actually moving out of brewing itself and concentrating instead on pub management  an area where they believe they stand to make the greatest profits .  At the end of the 80s the famous Manchester firm of Boddingtons sold its brewing operation to Whitbread ;  yet during 1988 alone ,  Claire Hunt has noted ,  Boddingtons undertook the refurbishment of 50 of their tied houses .  More recently , at the end of 1990 the regional brewing giant Greenall Whitley announced that it was closing both its breweries at Warrington and Nottingham ( formerly the independent Shipstone 's brewery ) to concentrate solely on running pubs contracting out its beer to be <head>produced</head> by former rivals Allied Breweries . The principal victims or beneficiaries of this change of direction are the historic tied houses .  And the principal problem facing them today is the replacement of genuine and much - loved historical features by bogus period fittings  which are invariably couched in a vaguely Victorian or Edwardian sham - historical style .

Later ,  when the wind has picked up ,  the gliders weathercock round and can be free to tip over so that the into - wind wing is upwards .  Another hazard is the wind swinging and increasing during the day so that the glider ends up parked facing directly into the wind .  If the glider is facing across the wind with the into - wind wing held down , the wind will be blowing on to its top surface , <head>producing</head> an extra down - load . However ,  in a strong wind several tyres are required to stop the into - wind wing lifting up. The upper tip will be high in the air where the wind is stronger ,  while the lower wing will be close to the ground where the wind is much lighter .

Never having shown the same propensity as the French for violent revolution ,  the dispossessed have entered into a complex ritual of action within the processes of the criminal justice system ,  and in doing so have encouraged those tasked with their containment to consider them as being less than human and therefore needing further control and discipline .  As Wilson  ( 1981 )  ,  Reiner  ( 1985 )  ,  and others have clearly identified ,  policing is basically a socio - political tool of the state and government .  It is sustained by an intimate knowledge of its enemy the underclass of society and exemplary use is made of this knowledge to <head>produce</head> the technological and structural means for the continuity of this system of power . As we shall see ,  there is now a specifically created police culture of the dramatic ,  which incorporates illusion ,  praxis ,  and imagery as part of a well - directed social production .  It rejoices in an enhanced belief in Manichaean and mythological archetypes of good and evil which are made manifest in exaggerated games of cops and robbers .

Furthermore ,  as these college - based insiders stress ,  their essays do not represent police college views or those of the Home Office ;  and both Thackrah  ( 1985 )  and his publisher ,  James Tindall ,  take pains to ensure from the outset that we are aware than any views expressed in the book are those of individual contributors ,  and not those of the college ,  the Home Office ,  or even the police service .  One might suggest then that the major project Holdaway recognized was missing from the college inventory is still to come !  Indeed the anonymous reviewer of the Pope and Weiner edition went on to propose that if the police staff college is to fulfil its task of <head>producing</head> a major project with any credibility , it must encourage its academic staff to go out into the field to study policing at first hand . Other challenges to social researchers to pursue a form of participant observation are to be occasionally found in the journals :  questions were being raised about what the police were doing ,  what they ought to be doing and how they ought to be organised and accountable .

questions were being raised about what the police were doing ,  what they ought to be doing and how they ought to be organised and accountable .

To have advanced within the job and achieved rank means he is likely to have followed and supported institutional precedents without question ,  and to have unwittingly accepted and been involved in the reproduction of the narrow modes of thought and practice demanded by the culture .  It is this special knowledge ,  or gnosis ,  which hopefully can make the inside ethnography so different and illuminating .  Burridge ( 1969 ) has written most persuasively about the effects which fieldwork can have on the anthropologist , describing the prophetic experience this can <head>produce</head> . He links this to the act of consciousness raising ,  which I consider presents the greatest problem for the insider who cannot leave the field or return to academia .  The insider/ethnographer can turn his understanding of an interpretive methodology to an assessment of his own actions ,  and see connections as if scales had been removed from his eyes .

Once the semantics of police experience were revealed ,  I had to live with the problems experienced by both Castenada and Favret - Saada ,  although I demur from casting myself into their intellectual companionship .  Reality itself then became a construct of knowing and being known ,  and of living with the alternative possibility .  For personal transitions made across physical and psychic boundaries during the subjectivity of the field situation can <head>produce</head> disjunction ; indeed they can paralyse . In such a situation it is therefore all the more necessary to recognize the unique place the ethnographer holds and to capitalize on it .  During this time of subjective observing participation ,   the policeman/insider moves to the margins ,  to a point where analysis negates automatic approval or predisposition for a world of known categories and classifications .

As a result ,  the uniform polises often complain that the quality of prig has been forsaken to be replaced by quantity .  This qualitative/quantitative dilemma produces a further schism between uniformed policeman and detectives ,  for CID systems of maximizing and negotiating both the crimes recorded and their eventual classification can drive a wedge between the two units .  Once again the result is disjunction , for it is quality and not quantitative measures in the work experience which <head>produce</head> self - esteem for the individual . As Pirsig  ( 1979 :  277 )  correctly observes ,  qualitative value is the predecessor of structure .

We have no way of knowing exactly when these experiences took place .  All we can reasonably conclude is that they happened at the same time .

Recent experiments on the psychophysiology of selective attention by ,  for example ,  Steven Hillyard at San Diego and Emanuel Donchin at Illinois have successfully related different endogenous components in the ERP to different stages in the process of selective attention .  Suppose a subject is listening to different sequences of sounds played independently to each ear through a pair of headphones in order to pick out and respond to a particular target sound .  If the subject is instructed to attend to one ear and ignore the sounds coming into the other ear , all the sounds in the attended ear will <head>produce</head> an enhanced N100 component in the ERP . ( The name N100 indicates a systematically occurring negative shift in the ERP which peaks about 100 msec after the stimulus .  )  This enhancement is thought to be associated with the extraction of additional information about the stimuli in the attended ear .

Despite the publicity giving the facts surrounding the transmission of the disease ,  ignorance was such that they became afraid of normal social interaction .  It soon became clear that I could no longer rely on friends for help with everyday chores like shopping and housework when I needed it .  Whilst resolving to stay at independent as possible , I contacted ACET who I knew <head>provided</head> practical care at home . I had previously spent about two years asking local social services and friends for help and not having it happen ,  so my flat had become pretty run down. There was also the question of my own exhaustion .

The link between Irish catholicism and Irish nationalism is deeply rooted .

The church not only <head>provided</head> solace and comfort in those long years , but also a vigorous identity which enabled its people to hold up their heads amid the persecution and oppression . It provided intellectual and spiritual leadership and some alleviation from hunger and starvation .

At the Huntsman 's  Inn in Ide ,  Kent ,  the refurbishment proposals were to involve demolitions so extensive that all but a portion of the building 's  external wall would be destroyed ,  the planned reconstruction included an extension that would double the size of the original structure .  It seems most surprising that the breweries consider the large open space to be the pub 's  ideal internal form ,  or believe the artificial ,  standardised historic pub interior to be preferable to genuine historic detail ,  when the original internal divisions and features are essential elements of the historic character that customers expect when entering such a building .   The Duke 's Arms at Presteigne in Powys <head>provides</head> the perfect illustration of how the misguided quest for the ideal traditional pub character can seriously threaten genuine historic features . This pub was originally a 17th century timber frame jettied building ;  in the early 19th century its front was removed and a new rendered facade added .  Although the loss of the original front is regrettable ,  the present facade is in accord with the general architectural character of the street and retains original late - Georgian features ,  such as its sashes with glazing bars .

Fry was a connoisseur of Renaissance art ,  but also he defended Post - Impressionism  ( a term he invented )  ,  was a painter ,  and published a monograph on Czanne .  In 1933 he wrote as follows in a lecture at Cambridge University :  An enormous amount of work has been done and perhaps still more <head>remains</head> to be done in arranging works of art in exact sequence of time . It is here that the Germans have done so much pioneer work ,  and indeed the whole tendency of their art historical studies has been to regard works of art almost entirely from a chronological point of view ,  as coefficients of a time sequence ,  without reference to their aesthetic significance .  The title of the lecture in which these words appeared was Art - history as  an Academic Study ,  but those were early days for the subject in the British Isles ;  only in London was there undergraduate teaching ,  at the Courtauld Institute which opened in 1933 .

Moreover ,  His role shifted easily from the alienated critic writing art columns for intellectual magazines to an impresario in the New York art - world judged by his commitment to a specific type of art and respected for its ultimate  ( commercial and influential )  success .  Greenberg 's  articles are marked by a confident authority ,  as in the following passage .  Looser paint - handling , combined with what <head>remained</head> an essentially Cubist sense of design , drawing , layout , was what artists as different as Gorky and Pollock had in common during the mid - 1940s . If the term Abstract Expressionist means anything verifiable ,  it means painterliness :  loose ,  rapid handling ,  or the look of it ;  masses that blot and fuse instead of shapes that stay distinct ;  large ,  conspicuous rhythms ;  broken  color  ;  uneven saturations or densities of paint ;  exhibited brush ,  knife ,  finger or rag marks  in short a constellation of physical features like those defined by Wlflinn when he extracted his notion of the Malerische  from Baroque art .  As we can now see ,  the displacing of the linear and quasi - geometrical as the dominant mode in New York  ( and Parisian )  abstract art after 1943 offers another instance of that cyclical alternation of non - painterly ,  or linear ,  and painterly which has marked the evolution of Western art since the sixteenth century .

This is one of the special characteristics of catholicism ,  and is found to a much lesser extent in non - episcopal traditions .  Failure to conform to directives of priests and bishops were seen to break the very fabric of communion and to allow sin to enter in .  This <head>remains</head> particularly so today where an objectivist stance on morality prevails in a national or local culture anywhere in the catholic world . From within this perspective bishops and clergy lay down rules for the laity to follow in any given situation and the teaching of the church is seen as absolutely clear and devoid of problematic .  Rules are enforced rather than principles declared .

It should be added here that the high clergy hardly recognized that they had actually been exercising a political religious power of a specifically sectarian or monopolistic type .  Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate ,  they meant they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state .  But they did and still do <head>remain</head> the authoritative conscience of the nation . In addition ,  the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships ,  doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues .  Part of the overall argument of this book is that ,  as the Roman catholic church is principal validator or legitimator of the Southern state along with the concept of the national entity ,  what that state goes on to do in the field of social ethics cannot be separated out from the responsibilities of the church .

From 1899 ,  the intention of the clergy to assume and maintain absolute control of their schools led a number of them to refuse to appoint members of the Irish National Teachers '  Organization so as to avoid trade union interference .  The result was that the union became subordinated for some time to the hierarchy and a breakaway union of protestant teachers was formed .  Despite the curtailment of some of the clergy 's powers , friction between the teachers ' associations , particularly the INTO , and the Roman catholic clergy has <head>remained</head> until this day . Clergy control of the schools had indeed become a priority for the church leadership .  The understanding reached between them and the catholic  nationalist lay leadership resulted in schooling in the future state being allocated to the domain of the church ,  in exchange for the legitimation of that state by the church leadership .

Although biological methods of pest control such as Bacillus thuringiensis   ( for caterpillars )  are now available to committed organic gardeners ,  there are few of us who never  need to resort to the use of chemicals .  Pesticides are either selective  ( affecting specific insects only )  or non - selective .  Some kill on contact and are then rendered ineffective , whereas systemic ( translocated ) chemicals are absorbed into the plant 's system and <head>remain</head> active for much longer , which could delay the harvest of fruit and vegetables . Many gardeners prefer to apply systemic chemicals to ornamentals ,  restricting edible plants to spot treatment with contract pesticides .

Few prior to Jones had cared to admit this seditious point except in the columns of the Police Review  ,  where disgruntled beat officers  ( often anonymously )  indicate the paradox of being the revered and reviled base on which all the hierarchy is built .   Jones 's  book remained untouched on the shelves of Northumbria 's  modest library in its first two years ,  even though it had good reviews ;  and the influence of his research has been all but negligible .  For even though some attempt to give status to the community or home beat officer has been made following Lord Scarman 's ( 1981 ) report on the Brixton riots which gave something of a slap on the wrist to the service , the deference accorded to specialist posting or to detective work <head>remains</head> untouched . In effect Jones 's  book revealed an unwelcome truth which no one really wanted to hear and which the service was able easily to diffuse and ignore .  Indeed when I was at the police college in 1987 and Jones was on the Senior Command Course prior to taking up a position as assistant chief constable ,  I took a straw poll among my immediate colleagues to see what influence such books achieve .

Descartes believed firmly that universals were formed in the mind and that ideas possessed objective and formal reality ;  that is ,  that it was an irreducible feature of ideas that they were able to be about  a class of objects .  Descartes is true to his radical dualism :  everything that is a mark of mind is withdrawn into the mind ,  leaving the external world in atomistic darkness .  But mind <head>remains</head> truly special . The materialist Hobbes ,  by contrast ,  denies that universality is really found even in the mind :  This word universal  is never the name of anything existent in nature ,  nor of any idea or phantasm found in the mind  my italics ,  but always the name of some word or name ;  so that when a living creature ,  a stone ,  a spirit  ,  or any other thing ,  is said to be universal  ,  it is not to be understood that any man ,  stone etc. ,  ever was or can be universal ,  but only that the words ,  living creature ,  stone ,  etc. ,  are universal names  ,  that is ,  names common to many things ;  and the conceptions answering them in the mind are the images and phantasms of several living creatures or other things .

( This implies of course that consciousness in animals is a hypothesis for which there can be no evidence at all unless we resort to anthropomorphism ,  which we usually do .  )  Most psychologists accept that cognitive processes ,  and therefore mind  although this is a term not widely used in the brain sciences  -  encompass both conscious and unconscious activities .  Clearly , conscious processes are central to an individual 's own experience , but most of us <head>remain</head> neutral as to whether they are central to cognitive processes given that many , if not most , of these are not conscious . It also follows from this that understanding consciousness would not be sufficient for understanding mental processes .  So current cognitive models of language ,  memory ,  perception and so forth are also basically neutral to the question of consciousness .

The yard was a product of piecemeal development over many years and found an important role in the air - braked wagonload network  ( Speedlink )  from the 1970s onwards .  It was a convenient gathering point for all non - trainload traffic to and from South Wales ,  and also became the gateway to south - west England with feeder services to Bristol ,  Exeter ,  Plymouth and so on .  Moreover it was not an under - used white elephant in the manner of Kingmoor yard in Carlisle ; traffic levels <head>remained</head> comparatively healthy right up to the end . In their quest to reduce costs ,  however ,  the Railfreight managers were keen to explore every way of streamlining their operations ,  and in the case of Severn Tunnel Junction it was found that total closure would bring substantial savings for relatively little inconvenience .  Most of the work previously carried out at Severn Tunnel Junction was transferred to Gloucester ,  Cardiff Tidal and East Usk  ( Newport )  yards ,  with Stoke Gifford  ( Bristol )  playing a minor role .

Mrs Thatcher has made it clear that Britain remains as adamantly opposed as ever to sanctions and has no intention of joining in new measures against South Africa .  The latest argument deployed in Whitehall yesterday was not only that sanctions hurt the worst - off sections of the South African community  the ones they are designed to help  but that financial measures against South Africa might induce the country to default on its international commitments .  Mrs Thatcher has emphasised that to avoid the troubles which have afflicted other African countries , a majority - <head>ruled</head> South Africa must be based on a sound economy . The British line has been that there is a huge difference between the image of Britain accepted in South Africa and the reality .

Then ,  realizing the cost and risk of setting up an American operation only for his own films ,  he backtracked and arranged for US to handle his company 's  big - budget pictures .  He then opened discussions with Universal ,  a company in which he had taken a 25 per cent stake back in 1935 ,  whereby Rank 's  smaller films would be packaged with the pictures of an independent US production company ,  and sold in a block to exhibitors .  But this sophisticated attempt to deal with exhibitor resistance to British films was <head>ruled</head> illegal by the US Justice Department in 1946 and had to be replaced by a less ambitious system , in which Rank 's films were sold on their merits . While continuing negotiation with the Americans ,  Rank also bought cinema circuits in Canada ,  New Zealand ,  Australia ,  Egypt and South Africa .  Many set the odds on Rank achieving his ambitions very low indeed ,  seemingly believing that ,  as Eric Ambler was later to remark ,  a policy of selling British cars to America with their steering wheels on the right would have had the same chance of success .

Ackroyd notices that the Eliot who had once called poetry a mug 's  game was eventually ,  in his play The Elder Statesman  ,  to use the same expression for forgery .  Ackroyd warns us not to jump to a conflation here ,  but he is intrigued by the coincidence ,  and it might almost serve as an emblem of his concern throughout the biography with the connection between poetry and feigning ,  and with the potency of parody .  The biography suggests that Eliot was never to lose the divided sense of his youth that human life is futile and meaningless that man is a finite piece of reasonable misery , in the words of William Drummond of Hawthornden , a good poet who was also a great plagiarist , and a great seeker of <head>shelter</head> in books but that an eternal order might be felt for , or invented .

The machine could either stand on the threshing floor of an orthodox flail - threshing barn , which provided <head>shelter</head> from the weather , or it could be taken to the ricks in the fields . The first practice probably encouraged the retention of many old and large flail - threshing barns which might otherwise have fallen into disuse ,  inviting demolition .  Indeed ,  apparently traditional flail - threshing barns continued to be built throughout the nineteenth century because of their ability to house the threshing machine as well as the crops .

The Ministry of Defence 's  legal department therefore has a powerful incentive to abolish commoners '  rights at Greenham as quickly and comprehensively as possible .  But officials deny that this is their aim .  They say they are prepared to extinguish only those rights of common attached to local property and covering things like grazing cattle and collecting firewood which apply to land on which hangars , missile <head>shelters</head> , nuclear bomb stores and other military installations have already been built . They would leave rights over the base 's  grassland in existence ,  provided they were not exercised .  If agreement cannot be reached on this compromise before next week 's  deadline ,  the ministry will use the Defence Act of 1854 to abolish all rights of common .

Although they will gallop around trying to get rid of the bot - fly ,  they seem to quickly discover that the bot will not follow them into the dense shade of a shelter shed or stable .  Foals who have learnt to evade bot - flies in such a way ,  will continue to do so as adult horses if they have access to shelter. Older horses who do n't try and run away from bot - flies , usually have not had the use of <head>shelter</head> sheds when they were young , so have formed the habit of no longer attempting to evade these injurious insects . As we have seen ,  the establishment of a habit can create a situation where a horse refuses to think  irrespective of how intelligent a horse may be ,  and even if solving the problem is in the horse 's  own interests .  This became even more apparent to us when we tried to devise an intelligence test for horses .

Mangroves are trees that grow right at the edge of the sea ,  held and nourished through characteristic prop roots that grip the soft mud .  They are not a specific kind of tree ,  but a way of being a tree ;  several unrelated species  ( black mangroves ,  white mangroves ,  etc )  are involved .  In Florida , the Caribbean , Queensland , and South East Asia they may be extremely extensive , and are important not only for the huge variety of life within them crabs , spiders , molluscs but also for the many creatures that visit them for food ( herons , egrets ) and which breed in the <head>shelter</head> they provide . In particular ,  mangroves are the nurseries for huge numbers of tropical fish ,  which as adults live in the open sea .  If mangroves are destroyed  ( as they often are ,  to create beaches and hotels  as in Miami )  then marine ecosystems a thousand miles away may suffer .

Once built they will last forever ,  the materials for repairs are always on site ,  and they provide shelter from wind and weather .  Few can afford the time and cost of building a new stone wall today ,  but the principles of dry stone walling ,  clearly outlined in Rainsford - Hannay 's  book Dry Stone Walling  ,  are straightforward and you can easily acquire enough skill to do effective repairs .  Well - laid hedges of thorn , hazel , holly , or beech ( or more generally a mixture of several species ) form very effective barriers , and provide <head>shelter</head> for livestock and a habitat for wild life . They require regular trimming to keep the growth thick at the butt  ( how often one sees huge ,  bushy hedges with little greenery and gaping holes near the ground )  and should be allowed to grow up for relaying every ten to fifteen years .  Hedge - laying is a highly skilled craft ,  and even at moderate charges your hedge will seem expensive .

If this could be proved beyond doubt  ,  direct drilling would fit in well with the organic philosophy .  The drills are too expensive for a smallholding ,  and even in the hands of a contractor ,  the technique  ( including spraying )  is not cheaper than conventional tillage .  Perennial weeds such as couch or coltsfoot are more difficult to control , and slugs , which <head>shelter</head> and multiply in the deep , hard - sided slits , can become a serious pest . Winter cereals are slow to establish ,  and must be sown earlier :  this is apparently because there is a tendency for stubble or killed turf to be pushed down into the slits with the seed where it can create anaerobic conditions leading to the formation of toxic substances such as acetic acid .  But one might be forgiven for doubting if this is the most likely cause of the toxic side - effects of direct drilling !

During the Second World War ,  when cattle food supplies were necessarily restricted so that the supposedly early maturing breeds were deprived of some of their rations ,  it was the Devon and the related Sussex which came to the fore and proved that ,  even under difficult conditions ,  they were able to produce good beef quickly .  They managed to finish on grass quite happily and their marbled ,  lean ,  tender beef caught the eye of the butchers ,  as it has for centuries .  In the 1960s the breed was exported to Canada and is thriving at altitudes of 1,400m on the eastern slopes of the Rockies with bitter winter temperatures and no more <head>shelter</head> than brush . They also thrive in Kenya on a farm at 1,800m above sea level ,  in a wet savannah climate where they are being used to improve native cattle .

The conversation in Zuckerman Unbound  between the novelist and his mother ,  in which he tenderly instructs her in how to field the intrusions that arise from the Carnovsky  outrage ,  reads authentically ,  autobiographically ,  enough ,  while showing a good Jewish son .  The Zuckerman books help one to imagine how Roth has faced the reproach that he has derided his family and sold their secrets .  But perhaps it is not too <head>simple</head> to suggest that we are also conscious of Zuckerman as a deflection of the wrath over Roth which works by making Zuckerman responsible for the outrage . We are conscious of what Zuckerman does for Roth :  when he helps a man to gather his spilt heart pills ,  it is Roth helping himself by assigning a small mercy .  In The Facts  ,  the tough guy with his shiksas ,  the supposedly self - hating Diaspora Jew ,  can be tenderised  a word Roth likes ,  for all the awkwardness it imparts to the operations to which it refers  into a sort of uxorious submission where his parents are concerned .

Left to its own devices ,  real ale stays in a drinkable condition for about a week .  When the pub landlord or cellarman considers that the beer is ready to serve  it is said to have dropped bright with the sediment of yeast in the belly of the cask ,  and to have matured sufficiently  a long plastic tube is connected to the tap and the beer is ready to be pulled to the bar .  The most familiar method of serving real ale is the beer engine , a <head>simple</head> suction pump operated by a tall handpump on the bar . When the handle is pulled the engine delivers a half pint of beer to the bar .  Some pubs ,  mainly in the Midlands and the North ,  use electric pumps to draw the beer to the bar .

Shop - taverns ,  serving the passing trade as well as the locals ,  had become common in many towns ,  whilst many pubs had been partitioned into two distinct areas  the bar room and the tap room .  Modern serving equipment  including beer machines and even slop trays  had appeared .  And the bar on which they stood had evolved from a <head>simple</head> counter or hatch to something approaching the form we know today : in his Encyclopaedia of Cottage , Farm and Villa Architecture of 1833 J C Loudon described the ideal bar ( the place from which all orders are issued ) as being of some size , with commanding views of the front entrance hall and back entrance . By the end of the Regency period the pub was becoming a far more attractive proposition for the government ,  too .  Wellington 's  Beerhouse Act of 1830 represented the most blatant attempt to eradicate the gin shop by promoting beer  and pubs  as a healthier alternative ,  abolishing the duty on beer and taking beerhouse licenses out of the control of the licensing justices .

By Journey of the Magi ,  however ,  we have birth and death but not copulation .  The reader is faced with a renunciation both of the sexuality bound up with primitive rites and ,  for the moment at least ,  of modern sexuality .  Vickery overemphasizes vegetation references by relating the temperate valley <head>smelling</head> of vegetation with its running stream to a particular scene in The Golden Bough , and by insisting that the water - mill is that in which Tammuz was ground and thus functions as a reminder that death is the price of rebirth . General hints at fertility ceremonies may be present ,  demonstrating another continuity in theme between this and earlier poetry ;  but it is important to see that ,  though its death and rebirth are also related ,  Christianity is presented by Eliot as an escape from Frazerian cycles of fertility  ( in the way that the Buddhist Shantih shantih shantih hinted at such an escape )  ,  not as its mere continuation .  Ariel Poems  ,  like Coriolan  ,  look back to the world of Eliot 's  childhood and youth ,  whether to his reading of Mayne Reid 's  novels or to his sailing off the coast of New England .

In time ,  spraying on the same scent habitually can make us completely insensitive to it .  By varying your perfume choice with the frequency you change your smalls ,  you never build up that resistance  ( and thereby avoid the risk of all but suffocating colleagues in a crowded lift with too much Shalimar while you still ca n't smell a thing )  .  Also , hormonal changes during the month can alter the chemistry of a perfume on our skin , so what <head>smells</head> great today may be decidedly iffy by next Thursday . Of course ,  nowadays ,  fashions in fragrance do mirror those in clothes ;  it 's  no coincidence may of the world 's  best - sellers have been created by top designers .  The next big thing ,  you 'll be interested to hear  ( and so will your gran )  ,  are nostalgic perfumes :  anything by Caron or Mary Chess ,  Guerlain 's  early fragrances ,  and look out ,  too ,  for a revival of Schiaparelli 's  show - stopping Shocking ,  in a bottle designed by painter Salvador Dali .

SPD still fails to ride the wave :  Setbacks for Chancellor Kohl and his team have not convinced voters the Social Democrats would do any better ,  writes John Eisenhammer By JOHN EISENHAMMER MUCH TO their chagrin , the woes of Chancellor Kohl 's centre - right coalition have yet to produce a <head>solid</head> wave of support for the Social Democrats . Successive state elections have seen the governing parties pummelled by a dismayed electorate .  But the SPD ,  instead of exuding the sort of assurance suggesting that the general election in December next year belongs to it ,  struggles to hide its edginess .

Ten soldiers were killed ,  including the coup leader ,  Major Moises Giroldi Vega .  The list of dead and detained suggested that the conspiracy against the general ran wider than initially thought .  But at the same time it showed that there remained a <head>solid</head> contingent of the defence force loyal to General Noriega , who is wanted in the US on drug - trafficking charges . The Defence Force 's  account raised doubts about the circumstances of the deaths of some of the rebels .  Only officers and NCOs were among those listed as killed ,  whereas dozens of lower ranking soldiers were involved in the fighting .

This victory may set Stretch up with a world - title elimination fight with Britain 's  other leading light middleweight ,  Chris Pyatt .  Pyatt ,  fighting on the same bill ,  was in equally devastating form ending the challenge of Wayne Harris of Guyana in the third round .  Despite conceding large advantages of height and reach , Pyatt went to work on Harris 's body with <head>solid</head> shots to the solar plexus . Pyatt has outstanding hand speed and he demonstrated it to full effect against an opponent who was clearly out of his depth .  Pyatt crashed in combinations at will in the third and a punishing left to the jaw broke the Guyanan 's  resistance ,  and referee Richard Davies rightly intervened .

Our American friend 's  cousin in London is an art student .  Her college library has interesting books ,  as well as the latest art magazines .  Her course teacher has given her a reading list , and the library staff are good at helping students with all <head>sorts</head> of interests . As part of the course ,  she has to choose a subject of her own about which to write a paper ;  one of her difficulties is to know how to form her own views ,  not just copy already received opinions .  She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ;  it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic ,  since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome ,  and although there were plenty of books about it ,  many of them went into extravagant detail .

There is no need to be intimidated by the formality of a staid institution 's  catalogue ,  or to neglect popular magazines ;  as for writing in various academic disciplines ,  there ought to be no barrier to learning about an interesting topic .  The reader 's  question of a book or an article should be what function the writing is able or unable to perform ?

Another <head>sort</head> of title for a group is exemplified by Der Blaue Reiter ( The Blue Rider ) .

A cynic will remember that research into the opinion - forming powers of newspapers has tended  to conclude that readers expect to have their existing views confirmed .  If so ,  the power of critics may be no more than the listings services offered in the papers or on posters ,  while real power can be found in the organisation of the art market .  A different <head>sort</head> of exhibition which has had some success in attracting attention , and thus newspaper coverage , is the prize competition . Here the critic is absolved from making judgements of his own by the need to report what a jury has decided about prizes .  The critic 's  standing is thereby reduced ,  and the description or evaluation of the prize works is less than likely to be uninfluenced by their new position .

It was a Romantic notion that there were resonances in the natural world and art ;  and it was Schiller who argued that music ,  the visual arts and poetry always become similar in their action on the mind .  THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE Describing the object is not the only <head>sort</head> of description that a reader can expect from a critic . The critic may be willing to share an experience with the reader ,  sometimes only of the circumstances in which a work was seen ,  as might be included in a personality article ;  but on other occasions the critic may give a fuller account of a personal response to a work of art .  This then becomes not a description of the object itself ,  but of the critical appreciation or dislike that the work gives rise to .

The difference yields a political meaning ,  in other words ,  and it would also appear to relate to the old theory of the difference between an author who tells and an author who shows ,  and who employs a medley of voices in order to do so .  It is a distinction which may in the end prove more suggestive than serviceable :  the author who tells ,  and who can be accounted something of a ventriloquist ,  may well ,  for instance ,  be more than capable of carnival ,  and may even be every bit as plural in his works as his dialogic counterpart .  But it is possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lies at the heart of it may be successfully applied both to some <head>sorts</head> of contemporary author and to some of what went before . The status of comedy is crucial to the debate ,  and we can at least be sure that Kingsley Amis would not object to having his practice compared with Waugh 's  ,  or to being placed with him among the monologists of the Right .  Against this monologic Amis can be set ,  by way of alter ego ,  the modernistic Amis of Barbara Everett 's  discussion of Difficulties with girls  ,  which occurred in the course of an essay on Hugh Kenner 's  fantasy of a British betrayal of Modernism ,  and which springs the surprise of conveying that Amis ,  so often supposed an enemy of Modernism ,  is really a Modernist .

My very writing became a different adventure ,  no longer the dolorous itinerary of a convalescent ,  no longer a begging for compassion and friendly faces ,  but a lucid building ,  which now was no longer solitary ;  the work of a chemist who weighs and divides ,  measures and judges on the basis of assured proofs ,  and strives to answer questions .  These remarks concerning If this is a man  do not describe the kind of book which runs easily to sequels ,  and which is easy to live up to .  Nor do they describe the <head>sort</head> of thing we are supposed to like very much . The first two autobiographies ,  that is to say ,  are the kind of book to which a tradition of literary interpretation has been inimical ,  imagining for itself a literature of impersonality ,  in which autobiography is subsumed ,  invisible .  Philip Roth 's  article refers to this issue in referring to the later book If not now ,  when  ?   Levi 's  Eastern ,  an adventure story of Jewish partisans during the closing months of the war ,  led by the Communist fighter - fiddler Gedaleh .

According to this account ,  the mind - body distinction as we know it was invented by Descartes .  He it was who conceived the idea of identifying mind with consciousness and of claiming that consciousness and its contents are radically different sods of things from bodies and their properties .  The mind is a <head>sort</head> of arena in which private objects are viewed : all our experience is , ultimately , confined to this arena . Descartes ,  so the story goes ,  reached this conception because ,  unlike his predecessors ,  the Aristotelians ,  he was obsessed by epistemological questions  that is ,  questions about what we can know and how we can know it .  He thought that the only things of which we could be really certain were things of which we were directly aware ,  that is ,  things in our own minds .

This thought casts the world in a profoundly different light from common sense in its materialistic moment ;  and much of metaphysics can be seen as a response to it .  Aristotle was the first to try to naturalize the veins of generality that must structure any intelligible world ,  by saying that forms in things were individuals ,  not universals .  The controversy surrounding the interpretation of Aristotle 's conception of form is unending , but , on all interpretations , his objective is to give forms as great an affinity with particulars as is possible , consistent with their retaining a <head>sort</head> of generality which is , so to speak , released in the intellect when they are thought . Something that was not form ,  but was only matter ,  could not become general in this way and could not answer to the generality of  the concepts with which we think .  The naturalistic instinct has been to claim that mind somehow creates generality in a sense stronger than that which Aristotle allows ;  it does not merely release generality from its potential state in matter ,  but fabricates it .

I now turn to a consideration of some implications of the cognitive neuropsychology of face recognition for phenomenology  an approach to the mind and mental phenomena that gives prominence to introspectible phenomena understood as acts of consciousness and their immediate objects .  Phenomenologists such as Dreyfus  ( 1972 )  argue that the level of explanation utilized in cognitive science does not truly exist .  The physical brain and the world of introspectible phenomenal experience are all that there really is : no cognitive psychologist has succeeded in defining another <head>sort</head> of input between these two which would provide the ultimate bits of information to which rules are applied ( p. 199 ) . My favourite phenomenological quote ,  however ,  comes from Jennings  ( 1986 )  :  social psychologists spent years conducting experiments to specify the exact parameters of a hypothetical motivational state called cognitive dissonance

We may even feel ,  as certainly  I do ,  that some of the later cantos are of such a nature that it 's  hard to conceive in any  age of a way of encountering them other than the way we 're here embarked upon .  And yet we need to remember  Pound ,  I think ,  would have wanted us to remember  what a latecome development this is in the relations between a poet and his readers ,  how recent this is ,  and ,  in the perspective of history ,  how bizarre .  We may surely placate the shade of Max Beerbohm sufficiently to acknowledge that the danger we run in approaching poetry this way is indeed the danger of one <head>sort</head> of professionalism specialized and therefore blinkered , inflexible , and humourless . I suspect that Pound is rueful at best when he looks down and sees us industriously annotating out of Sir Edward Coke Canto 107 ,  without noticing that the English language is in that canto handled with none of the sensitivity that would make those labours worthwhile .  What I am saying is that a lot of the common English objections to Ezra Pound have substance ,  and would be worth taking seriously ,  if only we could be sure that they were advanced in good faith ,  in humility ,  and with compassion .

The successful are always tempted to regard their success as a sort of blessing or reward for righteousness .  This can lead to judgements being made about the unsuccessful ,  the unemployed ,  the poor and the unintelligent which are both uncharitable and untrue .  I 'm thinking of the <head>sort</head> of attitude that suggests the unemployed do too little to help themselves , that if only you have determination and drive you can get on in the world . He says there are positive factors in the new atmosphere between local authorities and private enterprise ,  but it hardly touches on the problems of poor housing ,  lack of amenities and the continuing unemployment .  These problems are what lead to that sense of being left out ,  of isolation and despair ,  which in turn can lead to the symptoms we are familiar with  drug and alcohol abuse ,  crime and vandalism ,  debt and family break - up.

Today they make up a sad string of tarnished beads ,  from Bombay ,  Calcutta and Rangoon to Saigon  ( now Ho Chi Minh City )  ,  Hanoi and Canton .

Although it harboured the worst <head>sort</head> of poverty , inequality and exploitation during the 1930s and 1940s , not least because its bright lights attracted millions from the surrounding countryside , it seethed with exuberant life and economic activity . Then ,  under Mao Tse - tung 's  triumphant Communists in the 1950s and 1960s ,  it declined into a depressing ,  monochromatic shell of its former self .

Among the <head>sources</head> she will find are critical reviews , articles , catalogues and books about New York painting of the 1940s and 1950s , which will remind her that Pollock died in 1956 . There is no shortage of writing about Pollock ;  like other star artists ,  he has an embarrassingly large number of apologists ,  but fortunately there are select bibliographies which can guide her to key publications .  There may ,  however ,  be questions in her mind about the choices open to her :  how will the information in a catalogue differ from what is to be found in a monograph ?

There is no need to be intimidated by the formality of a staid institution 's  catalogue ,  or to neglect popular magazines ;  as for writing in various academic disciplines ,  there ought to be no barrier to learning about an interesting topic .

As has already been seen ,  it was the style of both church and politicians to avoid their mutual consultations being known ,  which tells us that the secularity of the state at that time was partially a faade ,  but one which it was felt by both interested parties had to be maintained ,  probably so as not to confuse the faithful .  In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 ,  while an extensive health bill was going through parliament ,  the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority ,  without qualification ,  is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family ,  the Church in education ,  the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions  (  Irish Independent  ,  12 Apr. 1951 ,  quoted Whyte 1980 :  143 )  .  It appeared that one of the main <head>sources</head> of the bishops ' opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation . That the bishops were  affected by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme  clearly they stood to lose money and independence if such a scheme were implemented  seems likely .  Whereas similar provisions in other countries were mainly designed to provide facilities which could or could not be used ,  the Irish ones were to be compulsory and there was to be no choice of doctor .

Lyricism can indeed be very like this description of it .  Poetry has often been a form of self - pity and a means of self - advancement ,  and it has often pretended otherwise :  Kundera 's  book rumbles such pretence ,  as in the comedy he stages of an embassy of poets to a college of policemen and a debate there about the aesthetic of the socialist love - poem .  But he does all this at the cost of <head>suspending</head> a due sense of the tendency there has also been for poets to see further than their noses , and to speak out , and to go to the wall for it . His Postscript evokes the aim of a white - coated Doctor Kundera to solve an aesthetic problem :  how to write a novel which would be a critique of poetry and yet at the same time would itself be poetry .  This aim has a sweepingness and a suspendingness which are apparent ,  too ,  in the novel to which it relates .

Conspicuous distortion of a broad opening spanned by a bressummer may call for the insertion of diagonal steel bracing ,  brick piers to stiffen flank walls and new intermediate supports .  A more common problem in timber upper floors and <head>suspended</head> ground floors is the rotting of joist - ends above built - in wallplates . When untreated timber  ( ie ,  wood which has not been impregnated with preservative )  is built into solid walls ,  it has no protection from dampness in the wall and it is common for joist - ends to be shielded by a skin of brickwork only a half - a - brick thick  ( Fig 31 )  .  Such joist - ends will decay if their moisture content remains over 20 per cent for long periods .

Some water authorities will give you a rebate on your water supply while you winter abroad .  But they will make a charge for disconnecting and reconnecting which may negate the saving unless you are out of the country for several months .  If you rent your TV and video you can save money by <head>suspending</head> or even cancelling your contract for the period you are away . Since an empty house is more of a challenge to burglars and squatters than one where there is lots of activity ,  you ca n't expect a rebate on your house and contents insurance  in fact your insurance company may even charge an extra premium if you are away for more than30 days. Finally ,  if there is a demand in your area for short - term property letting ,  you may be able to make a profit from renting out your home while you are away .

WEEKEND HIGHLIGHTS .

Southampton ,  moreover ,  have Rideout back in their attack after injury .

For a man with many God - fearing years with the Wee Wee Frees ,  the decision to leave must have been difficult .

The campaign has been given additional clout this weekend ,  with referees under instruction to dismiss instantly anyone guilty of head - high tackles on or off the ball ,  and not to send them to the sin - bin where they have gone too often in the past .

ADECISION on whether a trainee journalist should be jailed for contempt of court was yesterday adjourned until next month pending a hearing in the House of Lords .  Mr Justice Hoffman said in the High Court that he had decided to suspend judgment until he knew how soon the House of Lords was likely to hear an appeal against an order forcing Mr William Goodwin ,  aged 23 ,  who works on the Engineer magazine ,  to reveal confidential information .  After being assured by Mr Geoffrey Robertson , QC , defending , that the appeal process would be dealt with this week , he said he had decided to <head>suspend</head> judgment until January 15 . Earlier yesterday ,  the Court of Appeal refused an application by Mr Goodwin 's  employers ,  the publishers Morgan Grampian ,  to revoke the order forcing him to hand over notes containing confidential financial information concerning a company ,  which cannot be named for legal reasons .  The company alleges that the information came from a stolen document ,  and wants to take action against the source .

Throughout the late 1970s ,  tens of thousands of dolphins were killed by Turkish hunters each year .  In 1980 ,  the catch exceeded 54,000 animals ,  but in 1981 fell to about 10,000 ,  with harbour porpoises rather than dolphins comprising most of the catch .  The populations of dolphins and porpoises were finally on the verge of total collapse when the Turkish Government <head>suspended</head> the hunt in 1983 , and commissioned a report on the populations of dolphins and their effects on fish stocks . Although the report was due in 1987 ,  it has not yet been presented .  Turkey is a signatory to the Berne Convention ,  which prohibits indiscriminate killing of cetaceans .

So this is an odd time to let the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade wither ,  or to be thinking of dismantling the post - 1945 multilateral trading system in favour of a slide to managed trade and protection .  Of all the risks that face the world economy over the next few months ,  the most easily avoidable is this threat of trade war .  The European Community and America need to resume the GATT talks at once , patch up their quarrel over farm trade , and conclude the agreements on services and other issues that had seemed within reach when the talks were <head>suspended</head> . Then ,  equally important ,  George Bush must sell that deal to Congress with far more enthusiasm than his officials have lately shown for the multilateral approach to trade reform .  For the rest ,  the best advice for economic policy - makers is to recall two principles of sound central banking  one forgotten in the 1930s and the other in the 1970s .

But it does not take long to decide that the experiment is being conducted with skill ,  and that the pursuits have at least a little in common .  A piece of oral history may be meant to do without a presiding historian in much the same way in which an analytic session may be meant to do without a presiding analyst ;  theoretical presuppositions are subject in each case to a show of suspension ,  though it is clear that the theories of Freud and others will be present in the consulting - room ,  and that oral historians may be sympathetic to socialism and to the methods of  Marxist historiography .  Fraser 's book is not without its evident presuppositions , and not every reader will feel that this autobiographer , having perused and digested his tape - recordings , <head>talked</head> to his analyst and completed his inner and outer voyages , knew something radically different about his past from what he had known before : that something had been found , or proved . He had lived with his past for the best part of fifty years ,  and his book tells what he had come to know of it over that interval of time ,  with help from the theories of Marx and Freud .  And in so doing it can often convey that a past is not a thing to be discovered .

If the Maronites had taken a similar path ,  perhaps seeking a confederated state within a Greater Lebanon ,  the catastrophe that befell their grandsons might have been averted .  The Christians gave no indication at the time that they foresaw any such developments ,  although Arab nationalists in Lebanon and Syria at first refused to recognise that a nation - state existed which was separate from Syria .  This is the genesis of so much of the rhetoric from Syrian leaders today who <head>talk</head> of Syria and Lebanon as one country . Despite all the criticism of President Assad ,  there is no evidence that Syria wishes to annex Lebanon .  But the Arab nationalist belief that the two countries contain one Arab people  that there was therefore something immutably wrong in the creation of Greater Lebanon  has never been abandoned .

All behaviouristic theories of cognition are viciously third - personal ,  where that expression signifies ,  first ,  that they cannot be applied to the first - person perspective and ,  second that our ability to apply them to the third person really rests on our bringing to bear  first - person knowledge :  as with rats in mazes ,  where my  plain and unreduced apprehension of the rat 's  environment enables me to see its  grasp of that environment in terms of its behaviour within it .  Our general topic of discussion is perceptual consciousness and the problem that it constitutes for physicalism .  In showing that cognition as a whole cannot be <head>treated</head> behaviouristically , I have not thereby shown that a behaviouristic treatment of sense - experience is false . So perhaps my overkill misses the target :  perhaps the behaviourist analysis of perception is sound ,  even though a general behaviourism is not ,  and what BS lacks is not knowledge of the nature of certain mental states ,  but only the ability to respond spontaneously to visual stimuli ,  that is ,  to respond as a result of actually seeing them .  Reflection on the nature of the argument against behaviourism in general ,  however ,  reveals that the argument refutes the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular .

First ,  it omits the first two years of the Thatcher government 's  record ,  when output fell 3.5 per cent .  Second ,  no respectable economist derives a trend by comparing a trough year  ( 1981 )  with a peak  ( 1988 )  :  sensible figures can only be obtained by contrasting peak - with - peak or trough - with - trough .  Third , even growth rates obtained by comparing similar points in successive economic cycles must be <head>treated</head> with caution if the end - year shows a massive balance of payments deficit . Any fool can boost spending by taking out an overdraft ;  no bank manager would deduce from such figures that the same growth could ,  or should ,  be extended indefinitely .

In contrast ,  the effect of dealing with domestic disputes can be traumatic on some policemen as they momentarily place their own children and family in the situation of emotional horror they encounter .  However ,  it is generally the case that violence against women provokes no strong emotion in policemen .  Faragher ( 1985 ) found that police in Great Britain downgraded the seriousness of violence against women in the home , for although formal regulations state that it is to be <head>treated</head> as an arrestable offence , policemen often redefined the incident as lying outside law enforcement ( emphasized by Policy Studies Institute 1983b : 64 ) . In the case of the RUC ,  domestic disputes are routinely attended for reasons other than law enforcement .  This is true irrespective of the level of violence ,  although the masculine occupational culture of the force contains many of the same sanitizing euphemisms for violence against women  ( giving the wife a diggin '  .

( The term agenda - setting was popularized by McCombs and Shaw ,  1972 ;  Shaw and McCombs ,  1977 ;  though the idea had been around since at least Lazarsfeld ,  Berelson ,  and Gaudet ,  1944 .  For a producers '  rather than a consumers '  perspective on agendasetting see Hetherington ,  1985 ;  Blumler and Gurevitch ,  1986 ;  Blumler ,  Gurevitch ,  and Nossiter ,  1986 and 1989 .  )  This agenda - setting thesis is very plausible and usually <head>treated</head> as an established law of social science in introductory textbooks , though much more sceptically in research reports . But ,  as McQuail  ( 1987 ,  pp. 2756 )  himself has recently pointed out ,  most of the accumulated evidence is inconclusive and the media - dominated agenda - setting hypothesis has the status of a plausible but unproven idea .  Studies by McLeod ,  Becker ,  and Byrnes  ( 1974 )  and Iyengar and Kinder  ( 1987 )  ,  for example ,  suggest that the media set the agenda for only a part of their audience :  those highly reliant on a particular news source ,  those low in political involvement and information ,  and those who are relatively inattentive to the news generally  in short ,  those who are marginal to politics .

Thus ,  leaving the graduated scheme out of account for a moment ,  the position we have reached today is that the state pays to all retired persons ,  without regard to means ,  a pension roughly of subsistence value .  It finances these pensions from a flat - rate weekly poll tax ,  called a contribution ,  and a levy on employers per head of employee ,  with some supplement from general taxation .  The amount of the pension is not related actuarial to the sums which each recipient has actually paid in contribution ; but the right to receive it is <head>treated</head> as flowing from the possession of a contribution record , and indeed the pension rates are represented as related to the contribution rates , assuming contribution over a full working life . In this social service ,  therefore ,  the institutional element consists not in the great organisation over which John Boyd - Carpenter presides ,  with its large and efficient staff and its famous calculating machine at Newcastle .  It consists in the expectation on the part of the whole population that they will receive from the state on retirement a pension sufficient for subsistence ,  whatever their income .

The title of the lecture in which these words appeared was Art - history as  an Academic Study ,  but those were early days for the subject in the British Isles ;  only in London was there undergraduate teaching ,  at the Courtauld Institute which opened in 1933 .  His unusual topic gave Fry trouble with the title of his lecture :  The mere fact that we have no word to designate that body of studies which the Germans call Kunstforschung   a body of studies of which the actual history of Art is only a part  is significant .  I am obliged to <head>use</head> the awkward and inadequate word Art - history for it . Critical appreciation was desired by fry as a necessary part of a course in art history ;  ,  and is today naturally included .

The imperative for a writer of a chronological survey is that a defined period of time is covered ;  this may be linked with a theme ,  such as the history of styles in Gombrich 's  case ,  but it is unlikely to be linked solely with a spotlight on quality .  Excellence is not necessarily a criterion for including a picture or a sculpture in a chronological survey .  The author may choose to <head>use</head> a characteristic work , something typical of its time and place . A work of outstanding quality is a pinnacle ;  it is not typical .  There are also technical limitations .

The Cold War was at its height when Peter Benenson ,  the British lawyer ,  founded Amnesty ,  and three decades later it is hard to believe that the Moscow AI Group finally has permission to become part of Soviet life .  Similarly ,  the idea that a human rights concert should be held in the very stadium in Santiago where Allende 's  officers rounded up thousands of Chileans in 1973 ,  prior to committing gross violations ,  stretches the powers of credulity .  But incredulous , or not , the events happened ( millions of television viewers worldwide <head>watched</head> the Chilean concert ) and as such they typify the massive changes that Amnesty has undergone in its 30 - year history . Sadly ,  one thing has not changed in 30 years :  certain governments of the world still falsely imprison ,  torture and execute their citizens ,  regardless of internationally agreed standards that expressly forbid such abuses .  Around the world today ,  more than 100 countries still retain the death penalty ,  and two out of every three human beings live under governments that use torture and other cruel ,  inhuman and degrading treatment against them .

It is also important that you try and evaluate the dramatic  experience of these different forms of presentation  this is worthwhile ,  because it will make you think about the different ways in which an actor can work and the various ways in which his skills are used .

One of the things you will notice when <head>watching</head> the television is that close - ups are used very effectively , and so it is of vital importance that the actor has absolute control over his/her face and expression . You should also look at the ways in which the physical movements of the actor are organised to suit the restraints of the small screen .  When we turn to the theatre the question of scale is also significant .

Nowadays the bourgeoisie is more likely to patronise the city 's  luxurious food and clothes shops ,  all housed in the medieval streets .  The oldest tavern is the Vlissinghe ,  of which mention was first made in 1552 ,  but there are hundreds of little bars and cafes ,  many of them housed in olde - worlde buildings that have the Americans squealing with delight .  Plenty have terraces from which to <head>watch</head> the world go by accompanied by a hot waffle or a glass of beer . There were once 40 breweries in Bruges ,  and although now there are only two ,  the choice of Belgian beers is still enormous .  One cafe lists 300 .

It stopped for a piss .  Ronnie could have done with one himself but he would have got arrested .  Its withers will never <head>win</head> any of the races Ronnie had been telling himself about , and he is reluctant to return from this long , defeated , dark - thoughted walk to break the bad news or his adventure to his wife and daughters . The story is wonderfully funny and depressing .  Ronnie ,  I think ,  could be held to be a precursor of P for Patrick Doyle in Kelman 's  novel of 1989 ,  A Disaffection  .

The predominance these spatial constructs have for the ordinary constable is essential to an understanding of the police mind .  Ideas of centrality and marginality of place link to the status of activities and tie in with perceptions of derogatory and despised areas of operation .  As a result , actual and symbolic transitions across spatial boundaries continue to create a crucial means of analysing the way police reality deals with the changes in power politics at all levels within the institution , and of describing the way status can be <head>won</head> or lost . The structural load which exists within seemingly minor career moves or internal transfers around the force is enormous .  Everyone inside knows or speculates endlessly on the politics of power implicit in the most minute gradations of change .

Referees seem incapable of deciding whether a fast ,  controlled snap punch to the face has scored or not ,  and they generally disallow them .  This causes the contestant to try and get even closer to the opponent 's  face with subsequent jabs ,  in order to pick up that elusive score .  Of course , a punch inevitably strikes home and , instead of <head>winning</head> a point , a penalty is incurred . The moral is ,  restrict your straight punches to the mid - section and land with a fair old thump in order to maximise your chance of scoring .  Stepping out of the competition area

It 's  the titles that matter ,  and Martina ,  with 156 ,  has her fair share of them .  In fact ,  by winning the Pilkington Glass Ladies '  title in June for the 10th time ,  she came to within one of Chris Evert 's  record of 157 career titles .  This latest victory at the sunswept and showery Eastbourne was probably one of her most satisfying , not least because she defeated a player in the final who herself , did everything but <head>win</head> . Arantxa Sanchez - Vicario positively demolished her opponents with a ruthlessness reminiscent of Navratilova 's  great rival of the 1980 's  ,  Chris Evert .  The 19 year old Spaniard has always had the weapons but ,  so often in the past ,  has used them sparingly in her pursuit of greatness .

I found these pictures ,  Like Shadow of War by B. Freestone from Harrow  ( left )  ,  to be the most vibrant ,  and the most attractive to view .

Soale 's Peace Perfect Peace ( above ) , is a more typical entry to the marquetry classes , and <head>won</head> the Jack Fletcher Trophy for the best piece in the Secondary category , for marquetarians who have never <head>won</head> an award . There seems to be an attraction amongst marquetarians for depicting Dickensian scenes of cobbled streets populated by pseudo - Dickensian characters .

Four regions were found to be above the average :  Scotland ,  12.2 per cent ;  the West Midlands 12 per cent ;  the South - west 11.6 per cent ;  and London 11.5 per cent .  Rates in the West Midlands ,  however ,  are still 8.3 per cent below the national average .  The biggest rises about 12.6 per cent are being <head>won</head> in smaller companies with a turnover of less than 5m . This suggests that such firms are reacting on a more ad hoc basis to pressure in the market ,  the report says .  The mechanical engineering sector has seen the largest increase ,  at 15.3 per cent ,  although pay is 7.3 per cent below the national average .

But several senior finance officers said last week that between two and three dozen health authorities could face bed closures and service cuts in the next couple of months ,  with others deferring developments .  Problems have arisen despite this year 's  cash for the NHS appearing ,  when it was announced last November ,  to allow for real growth for the first time in years ,  even after taking into account inevitable pressures such as the rising number of elderly people .  Since then , however , a whole range of staff from administrative and clerical , to senior managers , anciliaries and technicians have <head>won</head> pay rises above , and sometimes well above , the 5 per cent the NHS was given for inflation . Non - pay items such as drugs and equipment have been running above 7 per cent as inflation generally has risen .  Cost - improvement programmes ,  which are meant to generate internal savings ,  are proving far harder to deliver ,  finance officers say .

I have also campaigned for the Government to give AIDS greater recognition ,  not as a disease affecting specific sectors of the community ,  but as a social problem for which there must be adequate welfare provision .  Organisations like ACET need this kind of support to enable people like myself to retain maximum control and continue to live at home .  I have in recent years edited a self - help journal for people with AIDS , <head>written</head> for the national press and researched a variety of medical material for television . Without the help of ACET and other similar organisations I would not have been able to continue and maintain my independence .  By working co - operatively ,  longterm ,  with the people around me ,  I hope to continue for some time yet .

Her college library has interesting books ,  as well as the latest art magazines .  Her course teacher has given her a reading list ,  and the library staff are good at helping students with all sorts of interests .  As part of the course , she has to choose a subject of her own about which to <head>write</head> a paper ; one of her difficulties is to know how to form her own views , not just copy already received opinions . She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ;  it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic ,  since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome ,  and although there were plenty of books about it ,  many of them went into extravagant detail .  Happily her supervisor has guided more than one student through topics about Michelangelo ,  and has a route map prepared ,  including introductory and background books ,  but also passages from longer scholarly works .

A guide to art reference books published in 1969 had 2,500 entries ,  some of which referred to series ;  for example ,  there was a single entry for the series of monographs on individual artists ,  called Klassiker der Kunst  ,  also published in French as Classiques d'Art  ,  in which there are thirty - eight books .  This guide was extensively revised over nine  years ,  and was republished in 1980 as a Guide to the Literature of Art  History ,  intended for persons doing serious research in the field of art history .  Another sort of writing about art is what artists themselves have <head>written</head> , either about their own work or about other artists . This may be by way of theory ,  or on more matter - of - fact lines about technique or such questions as composition .  Some writing by artists takes the form of instruction ;  in every period manuals on how to do it ,  whether drawing ,  making sculpture or other technical tasks are found ,  though their incidence is irregular ,  and such treatises are often the work of minor artists ,  rather than the great ;  Leonardo is an exception .

Writing on Auguste Rodin can make the point .  According to George Heard Hamilton ,  Rodin became a figure of international significance ,  the most admired ,  prolific ,  and influential sculptor since Bernini .  His secretary , the poet Rainer Maria Rilke , <head>wrote</head> with feeling about his work , but during the 1920s Rodin was less regarded , and not until after the Second World War did his reputation revive under the stimulus of exhibitions and increasingly careful cataloguing of his work . A decline of the sculptor 's  reputation derived not only from the political discredit into which the regimes of the years before 1914 had fallen ,  but also from a distaste for allegory ,  and a revulsion from naturalist sculpture  ( which the young Brancusi expressed forcefully as a dislike for beefsteak )  .  With the rise of modernism ,  Rodin 's  reputation fell ;  with the decline of modernism ,  Rodin 's  fame is growing again .

Improvisation There have been many books <head>written</head> about improvisation and if I were asked to choose just one it would be Keith Johnston 's Impro which is straightforward , understandable , and theatrically aware . Nowadays ,  nearly every young person has probably had some experience of basic improvisation at their school or through the extensive TIE  ( Theatre in Education )  tours .  In drama schools ,  improvisation is about finding a way of expanding the imagination and liberating the senses ,  which can get too confined if students work entirely from a text all the time .
