I am afraid that by taking the extraordinary measure of stapling this report because some of the contents are so disturbing ,  Amnesty has again given credence to the belief that recent torture in Kuwait has been more terrible than in any other part of the world ,  whereas the repugnant patterns of pain - infliction described are all too familiar from Iran ,  from Myanmar ,  Amin 's  Uganda ,  a South America ,  South Africa etc. Although we may claim that we simply publish an objective report ,  the inference that exceptional evil existed during the occupation of Kuwait will naturally be made by those trying to justify the devastating Allied bombardment of Iraq ,  now retrospectively .  I feel Amnesty has to provide a quiet , more balanced overview of a region in order to maintain its impartiality and credibility , and to <head>operate</head> effectively .

Industry in general is expected to inherit many of the benefits in the future .  Pilots '  helmets with miniature built - in video screens may not have obvious applications in hotels and restaurants ,  but there are several defence - led developments which do ,  and which will increasingly be seen around the industry .  Typical of these is the GRiDPad , a ruggedly built , pen - <head>operated</head> computer made by GRiD Computer Systems . In battlefield conditions ,  particularly in the desert ,  keyboard - free devices are more likely to keep performing .  But in the hotel and restaurant industry ,  the GRiDPad 's  12 - hour rechargeable power pack and its genuine portability make it viable for operations like stocktaking .

It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have remained the province of the archbishop and his clergy .  The immediate result is that alongside a few major clerics such as Runcie and Jenkins ,  we find that Stalker ,  Sampson ,  Anderton ,  Alderson ,  Newman ,  Imbert ,  Dear ,  Oxford ,  and Hermon are national personalities ,  while a second division of chief officers regularly proclaim on a range of subjects which at other times would lie outside the province of the police .  Yet Robert Reiner ( 1989 ) , writing on the collective culture of chief constables , is the first to explore their extraordinary place in modern society , simply because as an lite among the powerful in society they have had little need to reveal how they <head>operate</head> , link together , or reveal what structures of significance guide their actions . Across the history of policing their need has always been for the light of research to illuminate the activities of the underprivileged and the powerless ,  rather than focus upon the lite themselves !  Analysis of police culture is therefore particularly suited to the anthropological method ,  for it requires an extended field study to reveal much about the unspoken agenda which determines many aspects of police practice .

The movement cost less than 10 per cent of the price quoted by the British firm and this included all import duties and delivery charges ,  and VAT .  Just in case the specification might considered inferior at this price ,  it includes as standard an eight day ,  three train movement with triple chimes ,   ( St Michael ,  Westminster and Whittington )  all on a peal of perfectly - tuned bells .  These are automatically silenced at night and may be silenced manually at any time by <head>operating</head> levers which are neatly and unobtrusively located on the hand - crafted dial . I might mention that I have been using these movements since the commencement of my business in 1983 ,  with outstanding performance both as to accuracy and reliability .  It is sad to reflect that this arguably more comprehensive specification is simply not available from any UK manufacturer at anywhere remotely near the price ,  yet there are several rival firms in Germany with this capability .
