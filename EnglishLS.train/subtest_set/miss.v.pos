Speech !  one of the boys shouted ,  and we all laughed .  I 'm going to miss you ,  I said .  Thank you , I 'm going to <head>miss</head> all of you . Jeff made his rescuing entrance .   Nobody 's  ever given a member of staff here flowers before ,  he observed with a twinkle .

Green eyes .  Her eyes were also grey like stones through clear water .  Pre - Astrid , Jay had been in a dead job , art workshops with utterly disillusioned teenagers , every morning she coughed she rang in sick , malingering Mondays , rain seeped in the doors of the empty bus every morning , the bus to the High Street for the next bus , hoping to be early enough to <head>miss</head> the screaming leering sneering schoolgirls she had to face all day . She was a washed - out wash - out ,  Miss ,  why 're you such a div  ?  After she fell in love with Astrid ,  she became Dragonfly Moonchild ,  the world her oyster ,  and for the first time on the daily journey ,  she saw an adventure playground over the hoardings by the Elephant and Castle ,  and all the poles were painted like a carousel .

Underline the follow - up by means of a loud shout to show that you have unified mental resolve and physical effort in the technique .  This is an important point given that otherwise effective techniques sometimes fail to score because they are delivered without a shout .  On the other hand , do n't make a habit of shouting every time you do something : this will cause the panel to switch off , and thereby perhaps <head>miss</head> an actual score . Slapping blocks The first of the few blocks that can be used in competition to be considered are the slapping blocks .

Didn't we share a bath when we were little ,  ride ponies together when we were bigger ?  Just us ,  fair and dark ,  peas in a pod ,  little and large  ( well ,  I exaggerate here ,  she 's  smaller ,  more slender ;  but then Jeff ,  he 's  given me new trust in my ass )  .

Michael ,  the second of three tennis playing brothers ,  took the 21 and under title with a powerful 63 63 victory over Graham Hobbs  ( Dorset )  :  whilst younger brother Craig ,  fought back from one set down against James Lake  ( Lincs )  to win the 12 and under title 46 62 61 .  Beating the Ingham family monopoly was Michael Calvert  ( Yorks )  who won the 16 's  title 76 46 75 against a tiring Richard Stamp  ( Lincs )  .  In the girls ' event , Catherine Wittenberg ( Kent ) , consolidated her position as leader of the Reebok 12 and under Grand Prix table by reaching the final , but <head>missed</head> out on maximum points when she lost to Claire Sewell ( York ) 64 61 . The 16 's  final was an all Derby affair ,  in which Tina Crosen defeated Helen Frankland 62 63 ,  whilst the 21 and under title went to Lizzie Jelfs  ( Oxon )  who outfought one of our top student players ,  Maggie Loughton  ( Yorks )  76 46 75 with an excellent performance .

Ashton ,  too ,  has made vivid use of occupational gesture from time to time as ,  for example ,  when his Swiss Miss milks her cow with the help of the three boys in Faade  .  One of his finest examples of occupational gesture as the foundation of a ballet remains Les Patineurs  .  Here he creates the many happy and not so happy incidents that can occur on a skating rink where even a professional can <head>miss</head> a trick . Jerome Robbins has a knack of using occupational gesture in many of his works and most particularly in The Concert  ,  where the well - observed behaviour of the many different concert - goers arouses much laughter .  Those in the audience who have had to suffer such behaviour in a concert hall ,  whilst trying to listen to a brilliant musician ,  know that his remarks about certain characters are only too true .

New Zealand pushed out to 26 - 15 with a Kevin Iro try and a second from Elia ,  but after David Tanner had pegged two points back with a penalty ,  the winger claimed the try of the match by finishing a thrilling move between Phil Veivers and Mark Bailey .  Paul Forber scored from close range three minutes from the end to give Saints a one - point lead and the crowd ,  such as it was ,  went wild .  There was even closing drama when Shelford <head>missed</head> a penalty , and a chance to save the game , with the last kick of the match . It was entertaining viewing for Mal Meninga ,  watching the game with his Canberra colleagues ,  but the Australian declined a 50,000 offer ,  made after the game ,  to rejoin St Helens .

Jose - Maria Olazabal starts the defence of his title today in illustrious company ,  teeing off with Bernhard Langer and Mark Calcavecchia ,  looking to pick up a 55,000 first prize .  With Severiano Ballesteros ,  Nick Faldo ,  Ian Woosnam and several leading Americans also in the field ,  Olazabal does not have the incentive of trying to gain a place in next week 's  World Matchplay at Wentworth :  he has already been invited to play in the event this year .  The Australian , Craig Parry , <head>misses</head> Wentworth , but by his own volition . Parry has turned down an offer to play in the World Matchplay and with it ,  an automatic 12,500 reward ,  and has also decided to pull out of a couple of rich Japanese tournaments ,  so that he can play again next week in the BMW International .  I feel there is more prestige in winning the order of merit ,  Parry said .

Meanwhile riots continue to scar the Dutch League ;  one match was abandoned recently in Rotterdam .  The Ajax case emphasises the danger to players ,  especially goalkeepers .  Two years ago there was a similar , arguably worse , incident in Madrid when Real supporters threw sharp metal rods from behind a goal at the Bernabeu , narrowly <head>missing</head> Bayern Munich 's keeper , Jean - Marie Pfaff . He could have been killed .  Real 's  punishment was to play subsequent matches behind closed doors .

From JOHN ROBERTS in Stuttgart BORIS BECKER disappointed his West German supporters for the second consecutive year when a knee injury forced him to withdraw from the Stuttgart Classic here yesterday .  The Wimbledon and United States Open champion , who will also <head>miss</head> next week 's grand prix tournament in Sydney and is unlikely to be fit for Tokyo the following week , has now lost any chance of overhauling Ivan Lendl as world No. 1 before the end of the year . At least on this occasion ,  Becker had played his way through to the semi - finals of the eight - man exhibition event ,  organised by his manager ,  Ion Tiriac ,  before pulling out .  Last November he arrived on crutches on the opening day with his left foot in plaster ,  having chipped an ankle bone .

The League appear to be saying that the difference between scrapping and cynical wounding is just three matches .  The other club to fall foul of the disciplinary committee yesterday was St Helens ,  who travel to Wakefield tomorrow without Roy Haggerty and Stuart Evans ,  both banned for four matches .  They were dismissed against Oldham last week , Evans in the final minute of a 36 - 6 defeat , after <head>missing</head> the start of the season through injury . Evans ,  like Haggerty ,  is not in the Saints side for his cerebral contribution ,  though there was evidence against New Zealand last week that the giant prop is at last gaining an understanding of his league potential .  The Kiwi tour continues at Wigan ,  where after the Oldham upset ,  the home side need a confidence booster almost as badly as the visitors ,  whose efforts so far have been disjointed .

Becker and Graf won Wimbledon and the US Open and did not get their pictures on the front cover of any non - tennis magazines here .  Becker 's  photograph was in the German newspapers yesterday ,  accompanied by lamentations about his physical condition after a knee injury had caused him to abandon the Classic on Thursday .  They were not taking the hero for granted , but <head>missing</head> him madly and praying that he would be fit to return for the Davis Cup . The feeling was mutual .  The Davis Cup is definitely the biggest highlight of the rest of the year for me ,  Becker said .

Robson ,  who watched Rocastle last Saturday ,  said :  He has made a good start to the season .

The hallmark of Wyllie 's  All Blacks is the ability to drive the ball forward repeatedly at close quarters ,  sucking in the defence before opening up and ruthlessly exploit any gaps .  Against BC the gaps duly materialised and Joe Stanley ,  Va'Aiga Tuigamala  a pocket - battleship of a wing  Walter Little ,  Bruce Deans and Zinzan Brooke crossed for tries .  John Gallagher , meanwhile , proved a more than useful stand - in for Grant Fox in the goal - kicking role , <head>missing</head> the sticks just once . Wyllie 's  verdict was a typically gruff Kiwi understatement :  There was nothing wrong with it .  He then added ominously :  In fact ,  it was a good score judging by the other teams who passed through here recently .

When Chubei slashes his neck ,  a thread of scarlet spurts out .  With its splashes of red standing out from the swirling whiteness of the snowstorm ,  this tableau combines the decorative and the dramatic in a manner reminiscent of the finest Japanese prints .  And throughout the evening , making you almost afraid to blink in case you <head>miss</head> anything , Ninagawa fills the stage with a constantly shifting sequence of such pictures including a magnificent riverside landscape with clumps of reeds bleached by the light of an enormous moon . The plash of flowing water is authentically audible throughout this scene .  And ,  everywhere in the production ,  there is deployment of carefully - chosen sound effects .

Pitting a slim - line orchestra against a jumbo choir might be hazardous with any body other than the CBSO Chorus .  In the fast passages the choir sang as one voice and did much to render some mannered readings of appoggiaturas and dynamics thrilling .
