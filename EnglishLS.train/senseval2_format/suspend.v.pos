Lyricism can indeed be very like this description of it .  Poetry has often been a form of self - pity and a means of self - advancement ,  and it has often pretended otherwise :  Kundera 's  book rumbles such pretence ,  as in the comedy he stages of an embassy of poets to a college of policemen and a debate there about the aesthetic of the socialist love - poem .  But he does all this at the cost of <head>suspending</head> a due sense of the tendency there has also been for poets to see further than their noses , and to speak out , and to go to the wall for it . His Postscript evokes the aim of a white - coated Doctor Kundera to solve an aesthetic problem :  how to write a novel which would be a critique of poetry and yet at the same time would itself be poetry .  This aim has a sweepingness and a suspendingness which are apparent ,  too ,  in the novel to which it relates .

A universal fellowship obtains .  The definition of personality which is harboured in such procedures has moved and influenced several generations of writers .  The art that comes of them is one in which imagination takes power , the power to distort and exaggerate , in which difference of person is <head>suspended</head> , in which the experience of time is as it is in dreams . The story that is told is a story which never ends  and which risks losing shape and momentum  because it is a story told of himself by a living author ,  an author who has yet to end ,  whose isolate 's  imaginative fury lives on to tell another tale ,  some more of his own story .  This fury can look like an onanistic or a solipsistic fury .

UEFA is unlikely to reduce a punishment apparently designed to make the Dutch authorities ,  civil as well as sporting ,  take hooliganism as seriously as the British have been obliged to .  Of course the Amsterdam incident was less grave than the Heysel disaster , which cost 39 lives and caused all English clubs to be <head>suspended</head> indefinitely . But ,  as Galler said ,  the iron bars were life - threatening .

Where these members were built into the original construction ,  such problems would be less likely ,  but the causes of defects and deterioration associated with bressummers should be identified ,  particularly if it is the intention to increase loads upon these elements .  Conspicuous distortion of a broad opening spanned by a bressummer may call for the insertion of diagonal steel bracing ,  brick piers to stiffen flank walls and new intermediate supports .  A more common problem in timber upper floors and <head>suspended</head> ground floors is the rotting of joist - ends above built - in wallplates . When untreated timber  ( ie ,  wood which has not been impregnated with preservative )  is built into solid walls ,  it has no protection from dampness in the wall and it is common for joist - ends to be shielded by a skin of brickwork only a half - a - brick thick  ( Fig 31 )  .  Such joist - ends will decay if their moisture content remains over 20 per cent for long periods .

In order to contain the higher profile of the new ,  glazed aisle roof ,  the wall was raised slightly with new ironstone masonry ,  producing a parapet wall under a new sloping stone coping .  The architect ,  Roy Toms ,  of the Waverly District Council ,  was worried about what could have been an unsympathetic alteration to a venerable building ,  but a visit to St Martin 's  ,  Dorking ,  another Woodyer church ,  confirmed that its architect had adopted raking parapets to terminate the aisle roofs there ,  and the discovery of this period precedent vindicated the use of this treatment at St James Court .  The original <head>suspended</head> wooden ground floor was entirely removed after penetration of this structure for the installation of the new cross - walls and their foundations showed that some residual sections were badly affected by woodworm . The new ground floor is of in situ concrete and contains horizontal drainage ducts .  Few additional loads were placed on the original structure .

Below this floor ,  a headroom of more than 2.4m  ( 8ft )  resulted in the residual lower - storey space .  The main east - west wing of the school originally accommodated two classrooms  as at Shawell ,  divided by a glazed ,  sliding - folding partition .  Above this central partition lay a heavy timber roof - truss , supporting the purlins and extending down to <head>suspended</head> ceiling level . As it was impractical to remove this essential structural element ,  the new first - floor construction had to terminate on this line ,  so the added floor was restricted to the east side of the central truss .  The western half of this wing could then be dedicated to a double - height living - room with French windows opening out ,  through a deepened former window opening ,  on to the garden .

The architects ,  John Cottam Partnership ,  found space for 61 flats ,  comprising 50 one - bedroom and 11 two - bedroom dwellings .  The enclosure of individual flats within the large open floor spaces was achieved with the use of metal - stud and plasterboard partitions .  Metal - framed <head>suspended</head> ceilings were installed throughout , two layers of fireline board being incorporated at ceiling level in order to provide a one - hour period of fire resistance between storeys . The partitions contain sound insulation and thermal insulation to the level required for inclusion of projects in the Electricity Board 's  Civic Shield Award Scheme .  All dwellings and the hot water system are heated using off - peak electricity .

So far the US ,  like the European Community ,  has preferred to leave the Central American leaders to work out their own solutions .  Last Friday ,  the US rejected a Soviet suggestion that the two superpowers act as guarantors of the peace process .  The discovery of 24 Sam - 7 anti - aircraft missiles in the debris of a light plane which crashed in El Salvador last month threatened to wreck the summit and led the Salvadoreans to <head>suspend</head> relations with Nicaragua . The issues of weapons shipments ,  attempts to achieve a ceasefire in El Salvador ,  and the stalled demobilisation of the contras were expected to dominate the two - day summit ,  which Mr Arias described at the weekend as critical to the future of the peace process .  Mr Arias ,  and the Honduran and Guatemalan presidents appeared pessimistic about prospects for the meeting .

.  ONLY a month before the publication of Lord Justice 's  Taylor 's  full report on football safety there were disturbing suggestions yesterday that some clubs have failed to implement interim recommendations made in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster ,  writes David Hopps .

IMRAN KHAN became the fifth player in Test history to take 350 wickets  joining Richard Hadlee ,  Ian Botham ,  Dennis Lillee and Kapil Dev  when he held on to a fine one - handed return catch to dismiss Ravi Shastri yesterday as India lost their last seven wickets for 143 on the second day of the fourth and final Test in Sialkot .  In a day that saw 100 minutes of playing time lost ,  first to crowd trouble and then to the weather ,  Wasim Akram finished with five for 101 after the tourists had gone from 181 for three overnight to 324 all out .  Play was briefly <head>suspended</head> at the start of the Pakistan innings when Sachin Tendulkar , fielding on the boundary , was pelted with fruit by the crowd . A public appeal restored calm ,  and the home side were 23 for one when bad light and more rain drove the players off an hour early .

So this is an odd time to let the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade wither ,  or to be thinking of dismantling the post - 1945 multilateral trading system in favour of a slide to managed trade and protection .  Of all the risks that face the world economy over the next few months ,  the most easily avoidable is this threat of trade war .  The European Community and America need to resume the GATT talks at once , patch up their quarrel over farm trade , and conclude the agreements on services and other issues that had seemed within reach when the talks were <head>suspended</head> . Then ,  equally important ,  George Bush must sell that deal to Congress with far more enthusiasm than his officials have lately shown for the multilateral approach to trade reform .

It was possible to see both good and bad in any view ,  and this proved the vanity as well as the uncertainty of human knowledge .

On the face of it they were an utter failure .  But that is too simple .  Clearly they failed to bring about disarmament , though they may have had a contributory effect on the decision to <head>suspend</head> tests in 1958 and later on the partial test ban treaty . In Britain they failed to convert more than a faction of the Labour party ,  which was outvoted the year after it won its victory at the party conference .

The Labour Party talked of them as if they were filled with caramels .  Canon Collins now credits the movement with two achievements  public awareness of what the nuclear threat was in reality and of the danger from the tests .  Khrushchev explicitly stated to me that one of his reasons for <head>suspending</head> tests was because he had studied the effect of the CND on the British public . If you believe that ,  there was a positive result .  It should also be credited with the fact that within a few years very little more was heard from politicians about the importance of the much - vaunted British independent nuclear deterrent against which CND had originally campaigned .

On 23 February 1972 ,  the DUP took a major step towards establishing its own political identity when the four MPs crossed the floor of the house to take up the position left vacant by the withdrawal of the Catholic SDLP as Her Majesty 's  Loyal Opposition at Stormont .  The period of opposition was almost comically short and its brevity showed how far events in Northern Ireland had passed out of control of Stormont .  A month after the DUP crossed the floor , the British government in London gave up the hope that the Northern Ireland government could restore order and <head>suspended</head> Stormont . The politics of the street ,  which had played such a large part in putting Ian Paisley into Stormont ,  had now returned him and his supporters to the streets .

Had the Presbytery been selecting  candidates and foisting them on the DUP ,  Smyth 's  view would be more plausible .  As it was ,  the Church was simply acting to preserve its interests and these were not the same as the interests of the Party. In the event , permission was given for Paisley and Beattie to go forward because they had been members of the Stormont Parliament before it had been <head>suspended</head> . It was obvious to all participants that the Assembly elections were a referendum on the proposals for the future of Ulster .  Those opposed to power - sharing wanted an arrangement to maximize the loyalist vote .

The priests should be thrown in and burned as well .  Sammy Wilson ,  the DUP press officer ,  dissociated the party from Seawright 's  remarks :  The DUP has always made it crystal clear  as Protestants we believe in civil and religious liberty for all men ,  and no one should be persecuted for their religious beliefs .  Seawright was first <head>suspended</head> and , when he failed to withdraw his remarks and apologize , was expelled from the Party. It has generally been the case that people who leave the DUP see their political careers terminated .  Only those who move to the Official Unionists have continued to win elections .

Secret Agents and Mystery Papers SO Iran - contra did not happen much ,  except to certain people ;  and even those people often felt caught up in events that were exceptionally odd and different ,  adventures they might have watched on television ,  and in which they especially did not expect to find themselves .

Two other people were to be visited regarding their absences .  In Amersham ,  the church meeting of the Lower Meeting House  ( Baptist )  heard in 1892 that several of our young members have been absent from the means of grace communion for many months and it was resolved that they be visited by two members of the Church .  Five years later the Meeting considered another problem and in its wisdom inverted the common law assumption that an accusation was not a conviction : The Case of Mr. H. R was brought before the Church , who had misconducted himself and at the recommendation of the Pastor and Officers was <head>suspended</head> until his guilt was proved . The Minutes do not tell us in what Mr R    s misconduct consisted and he is heard of no more .  Like the Baptists in Holmer Green ,  the Amersham  Baptists '  main problem concerned attendance ;  following traditional Christian practice they held that the indispensable sign of membership ,  of being in communion ,  was partaking in the Communion Service ,  whether this was held quarterly or ,  in their case ,  monthly .

The Stravinsky ,  if more detached and calculated a piece ,  equally engages the senses here in the incisiveness of Zimmermann 's  playing ,  his thrust ,  his fullness of sound ,  the quiet restraint he shows in the concerto 's  plaintive moments .  And the Baroque bustle of the finale shows both the soloist and the orhestra on their contrapuntal mettle  sharp ,  brisk ,  invigorating .  Samuel Barber 's Violin Concerto dwells on the instrument 's lyrical potential , something which the Chinese violinist Hu Kun manages to a haunting effect in the first movement and the <head>suspended</head> - animation Andante . More body to the English String Orchestra  ( an idiosyncratic name ,  given all the wind and other instruments which take part )  might have helped to throw the piece into clearer focus ,  but ,  in the final Presto  a rapid perpetuum mobile  they are at least all precise .  Leonard Bernstein 's  five - movement Serenade ,  inspired  ( if that is the word )  by Plato 's  Symposium ,  is dreary in the extreme and dispiritingly derivative  ( sub - Stavinsky ,  sub - Copland ,  sub - Ives )  ;  and it is vapid to listen to .
