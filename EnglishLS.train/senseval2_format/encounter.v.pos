An author is taking his revenge in setting down these judgements ,  begrudging the grudges of  others  while uttering ,  this once ,  the cry of the deserted child .  Neither of these books ,  however ,  could be said to be intent on revenge .  Glasser presents a full picture of the behaviour , good and bad , which he <head>encountered</head> in an area of maximum difficulty , and it is not often that such a picture has been presented . The familiar and approved accounts of Scottish life have long favoured a country of hills and fields and firesides ,  where braw lads and bonny lasses dance reels and go on ,  after early struggles ,  to better things ;  where the best thing of all is the kind landed family that comes up from London to visit them ,  famous for its stables ,  castles and ceremonies .  Another fallacious account comes to mind .

The status of comedy is crucial to the debate ,  and we can at least be sure that Kingsley Amis would not object to having his practice compared with Waugh 's  ,  or to being placed with him among the monologists of the Right .  Against this monologic Amis can be set ,  by way of alter ego ,  the modernistic Amis of Barbara Everett 's  discussion of Difficulties with girls  ,  which occurred in the course of an essay on Hugh Kenner 's  fantasy of a British betrayal of Modernism ,  and which springs the surprise of conveying that Amis ,  so often supposed an enemy of Modernism ,  is really a Modernist .  She begins by recalling a remark made to her a long time ago by Larkin , about difficulties <head>encountered</head> in his private life a remark which consisted of a joke to do with the impossibility of relations between men and women , followed by the notion that women ought really to marry each other , followed by but that would be wrong , would n't it ? And she notes that the same remark ,  or the same sentences ,  can be found in Amis 's  novel .  What interests her ,  apparently ,  is not the remark itself ,  but the degree to which the piece of recall  her piece of recall ,  presumably  failed to affect the novel in any way .

Stephen Stich  ( 1983 )  presents a case for a syntactic theory of mind which is more radical than Fodor 's  .  He argues that the language of folk psychology  ( talk about beliefs ,  desires and the like )  may float free of the kind of mental states that actually do the computational work :  these are defined solely by their syntax and causal role ,  not by their reference .  He spends a lot of time saying why this way of regarding syntactic mental states does not <head>encounter</head> the problem of the holism of the mental . 2 .  This means the process of assigning syntactic roles to elements of a sentence :  noun phrase ,  prepositional phrase ,  adverb ,  etc.

This is a phenomenon which most  of us experience from time to time ,  particularly when performing a highly practised task like driving a car or using a keyboard ,  and which the clinician often feels presents in exaggerated form in certain neurological conditions .  The term blindsight was coined by Larry Weiskrantz at Oxford to describe perhaps the best known example of this dissociation ,  in which patients with damage to the visual areas of the cortex deny being able to see a visual stimulus while behaving in some respects as if they are processing it ,  for instance by moving their eyes in its direction .  The difficulty here is the same as the one already <head>encountered</head> with the attempt to relate evoked potentials to conscious events . We only have the subjects '  external behavioural indicators  ( verbal or non - verbal )  of their experiences and we have no way of validating these indicators .  So we end up dissociating one piece of behaviour from another :  in blindsight ,  the verbal response No ,  I did not see the light is dissociated from the ability to move the eyes towards the light .

His ever - developing design gives the vital clues to Juliet 's  development from a child playing  with her doll to the shy recipient of Paris '  respectful admiration .  Juliet then becomes the slightly apprehensive debutante at the Ball where her movements ,  though tentative ,   are conventionally correct when she dances with Paris .  The moment she <head>encounters</head> Romeo and senses somehow that her life has changed her movement becomes more purposeful . From there onwards it becomes stronger and more emotional so that her joyous movements and later abandon in Romeo 's  arms are in absolute contrast to her later dance with Paris .  Her movements then are equally purposeful but they are constricted and withdrawn ,  so that her father 's  contemptuous rejection of her pleas and his throwing her to the floor seem the proper outcome of what in his eyes is sheer disobedience .

Flavours rapidly evaporate from hot wort while bitterness requires up to an hour to fully develop .  Brewers have been aware of this issue for centuries and have developed the practice of adding copper hops early in the boil to provide bitterness and aroma or late hops towards the end of the boil for flavour .  While whole hops are repeatedly claimed to produce the best hop character in a beer , problems may be <head>encountered</head> . First is the liability of hops to deterioration by oxygen in the air .  As might be expected this is accelerated by heat ,  making cold storage essential .

The commentator who has done most justice to this appeal to Virgil by way of Gavin Douglas is the South African ,  Anthony Woodward .  But even Woodward fails to bring out how surprising it is  ( as well as how the line Roma Profugens Sabinorum in terras  ,  has been enigmatically inserted in the preceding Canto 77 )  .  Pound in this passage recollects how , late in the war , he set out with borrowed boots and haversack from Rome , already doomed to fall to the advancing Allied armies , for the Italo - Austrian domicile of his natural daughter , Mary , and how , hiking and hitch - hiking , he <head>encountered</head> much kindness from Germans and Italians alike . What strikes him of a sudden ,  as he remembers this experience ,  is how it had been foreseen and marmoreally recorded by Virgil :  as Virgil 's  Aeneas left doomed Troy ,  carrying his household and ancestral gods ,  so Pound leaves the doomed Rome of fascist Italy ,  carrying in his haversack his  gods  books by Henri Gaudier - Brzeska and T. E. Hulme and Percy Wyndham Lewis .  For a poet so hostile to Virgil to discover that in extremis  only Virgil had foreseen and foresuffered his predicament ,  and thereby eased it  this surely constitutes a very poignant moment in literary history ,  and in a history rather larger than literary may suggest .

Lord Donaldson gave the seventh annual review of the organisation and administration of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal ,  on 12 October 1989 .  He said the purpose of the annual review was to inform the legal profession , the users of the court and the wider public of what problems had been <head>encountered</head> in endeavours to achieve better , cheaper and swifter appellate justice , what steps were being taken to overcome those problems and what success was attending those efforts .

Although often studying less controversial forces than the RUC ,  this panglossian portrayal has to be disbelieved ,  especially as the authors often indicated in an occasional footnote ,  or in a revealing preface or aside ,  that they faced problems in the field similar to our own  ( for example ,  see van Maamen 1981 :  479 ,  492 ;  Westley 1970 ,  p. vii )  ,  even when the research was covert  ( Holdaway 1982 ,  1983 :  12 )  .  The only exception to this is the discussion of the likely reactive effect caused by the presence of observers  ( McCall 1975 ;  Policy Studies Institute 1983b :  1115 ;  Reiss 1971 ;  Softley 1980 ;  Southgate and Ekblom 1986 ;  Steer 1980 )  ,  although no serious doubt is put on the validity of observational data on the police .  However , an increasing awareness of this omission has led some specialists in the area of ethnographic work on the police to address systematically the problems they <head>encountered</head> in the field ( Punch 1989 ; van Maanen 1988 ) . In the case of the RUC it is essential to reflect on the problems that arose in the research .  We believe that results can only be properly evaluated if the problems connected with the study are made manifest rather than concealed .

To help engender trust and familiarity ,  the field - worker 's  contact in the station was restricted at the beginning to a few hours a shift once a week ,  gradually being built up to a full shift ,  including mights ,  twice a week .  Time was initially divided between two sections within the station in order to broaden the range of contacts ,  and visits were made to other stations ,  but ,  as the time devoted to data collection lengthened and data collection itself became more intensive ,  the focus narrowed to one section :  roughly about twenty people .  However , other constables in Easton were <head>encountered</head> regularly in the canteen , on guard duty , and in the neighbourhood and community policing units of the station , and the personnel in the section periodically changed as a result of transfers . We were provided ,  therefore ,  with as broad a range of contacts as is possible within one station  ( although this breadth does not approach that which comes from survey research )  while still becoming close to one section ,  as is necessary in ethnographic research .  Field - work took place over a twelve - month period between 1987 and 1988 ,  and was sufficiently prolonged to avoid the criticism which brief smash - andgrab ethnographies often deserve .

But even for those who had little or nothing to hide ,  their sensitivity to the research led ,  in a minority of cases ,  to a reluctance to engage in conversation ,  the resort to silence being something which Westley noted in his research in the United States  ( 1970 ,  p. viii )  .

Given the nature of crime in Easton ,  the problems that Northern Ireland 's  divisions create for routine policing are as well studied there as anywhere .  Our choice was one which policemen and women from areas of high tension could not appreciate .  People from the stations we visited in such areas , or whom we <head>encountered</head> upon their being transferred to Easton , felt policing there was not typical and that we were obtaining an unrealistic view . As one said ,  what Easton has ,  unlike many areas ,  is ordinary civil policing  ( FN 16/11/87 ,  p. 6 )  ,  so that there is a continuity with policing in Easton before the current troubles began :  I was in Easton years ago when it was the old station ,  though basically policing at Easton has n't changed from when I was here years ago. It 's  still ordinary policing ,  though the station and the set - up within it has changed  ( FN 17/12/87 ,  p. 1 )  .

In the case of the RUC ,  domestic disputes are routinely attended for reasons other than law enforcement .

In the one instance of domestic violence we <head>encountered</head> during field - work , the officers arrested the man against the protestations of the wife , as is often the case ( see Fielding et al . 1988 )  ,  despite Faragher 's  argument ,  although primarily in our case because the man redirected his attack towards the police .  There are also big crime calls ,  which refer to the real job of crime - fighting ,  which the section police enjoy most .

The resources on which they call in making this decision include the above typifications ,  as well as local knowledge of the area and its crime ,  and contextual and time variables .  But in addition to these primary typifications there are a large number of more contextually specific typifications whose use has a less general purpose .  This might be because the people to whom they apply are <head>encountered</head> only infrequently in the course of police work . Examples here are typifications of judges  ( hard ,  soft ,  fair )  ,  solicitors  ( clever ,  stupid )  ,  rape victims  ( pure ,  asking for it ,  good - time girls )  ,  the typification common - law job for children born out of wedlock ,  and old dear for friendly female pensioners .  Another reason for the more restricted use of these sorts of typification is that the situations in which they become operative are infrequent ,  such as the typifications old biddies or old dolls for pensioners who make petty complaints ,  Easton funny for strange and odd events ,  and loopers for odd and strange people .

There are nine neighbourhood police in Easton ,  with their own sergeant ,  and they operate as two shifts .  Following the pattern of community constables in England ,  where the overwhelming majority are male  ( Brown and Iles 1985 :  9 )  ,  there are no females among Easton 's  neighbourhood constables ,  although for a short period the sergeant was female .  The shift times are designed to place policemen on the streets at times when they will <head>encounter</head> the maximum number of members of the public , even though this public thus tends to comprise shoppers and tradespeople . With no might duty neighbourhood police usually avoid loitering youths ,  drunks ,  and other might people ,  something which at least one complained about ,  leaving these categories to the section or reserve police who possess in less proportion the skills required for effective community policing .  Each of these constables has his own separate patch ,  so that Easton 's  built - up areas are divided into nine beats .

But ,  below the surface ,  it may have been defeating her ,  just the same .   Conclusion IN assessing the course of recent British history , the historian <head>encounters</head> a clear gulf between the perceptions of public commentators and the responses of ordinary people . Commentaries written in the 1970s and 1980s on the British experience since 1945 were full of clich - ridden observations on the decline of an ailing titan ,  and a fall from imperial and industrial greatness .  Any alternative view ,  it seemed ,  would imply a fatal lapse into Whiggism and a naive belief in progress .

It remained an integral part of a government department but with an attempt to try to introduce accountable management and run it in a businesslike fashion .  It was called a departmental agency ,  but the constraints of trying to be fully integrated with a major department like the Department of the Environment meant that the theoretical freedom to manage ,  which it had started off with ,  very quickly disappeared .

The experience underlined for Cuckney the importance of having clear goals in a crisis and being determined not to waver from the chosen course of action :  I think you have to be extremely clear - minded and unemotional about what your objectives are and if it is a public company you must remember the paramount importance of the owners of the business  the shareholders .  I had , as it happens , had experience just before Westland of another very well - known public company John Brown which had <head>encountered</head> difficulties . As chairman ,  I had been involved in its capital reconstruction and ultimate sale to  Trafalgar House. What was interesting about that was that at the time John Brown got into financial difficulties the banks and institutional shareholders took a tough but very constructive view that it was worth helping the company through a reconstruction rather than forcing it into liquidation ,  which had been an attitude prevalent some years earlier .

Cuckney has never found it difficult switching from the public to the private sector ,  or vice versa .  He has found the management problems in each sector to be remarkably similar .  There is a lot of common ground the same causes for companies and organisations <head>encountering</head> difficulties , but of course the solutions have to be tailor - made to a particular industry or company culture . , A sound organisation structure helps to overcome many operational problems , in Cuckney 's view .

In particular ,  the idea of space was transformed from the Aristotelian conception  a tidy arrangement of a simple multiplicity of things ,  not unlike ,  let us say ,  the shipping department of SearsRoebuck -  into a matrix for infinite potential complexities and states and tensions .  The main innovators of this transformation were not scientists but artists ,  especially Alberti ,  Brunelleschi and Leonardo ,  who created on their canvases and in their architecture and treatises a new conception of space .  When I first <head>encountered</head> de Santillana 's paper in the late 1960s I found it both fascinating and suggestive . Its attraction arose principally from its iconoclastic message ,  for de Santillana explained one of the key conceptual innovations in the rise of modern science in terms that challenged the assumptions of my teachers in the history of science .  They had argued that the new ideas about space and motion had arisen from an intellectual and ,  to a much lesser extent ,  empirical critique of the preceding ,  largely Anstotelian ,  notions .

In addition to the residential accommodation ,  the converted church includes an entrance and main stair lobby which extends to the full height of the north aisle ,  incorporates two arches of the original nave arcade and gives an impressive indication of the powerful verticality of the original church interior .

Constructional problems which were <head>encountered</head> during the contract included the discovery of the serious decay of a considerable area of the Kentish ragstone facing . Where this problem was found at high level on the aisle gable walls ,  it was owed to a poor constructional detail .  The original stones of the sloping gable coping had simply been bedded on the slate - roof covering of the aisles at their verges so that rain entering the joints between the coping stones had saturated the top courses of the stone facing and caused premature decay .

STRONG words and a tendency to make unambiguous rulings have epitomised Sir Anthony Barrowclough 's  five - year tenure in the office of Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration .  Popularly known as the Parliamentary Ombudsman ,  Sir Anthony has been surprisingly open about his work given the secrecy that pervades Whitehall .  Firm judgments of the cases he has investigated have often been accompanied by hard - hitting comments about the problems his office has <head>encountered</head> . This is very much a product of his legal background which ,  in a career spanning 40 years as a lawyer ,  has seen him spurn a more lucrative profession to concentrate on the injusticesthat accompany bureaucracies like the Civil Service .  Born in 1924 ,  his ambitions were delayed by the outbreak of the second world war in which he served in the Royal Naval Reserve from 1943 ,  first in Coastal Forces and then on minesweepers ,  rising to the rank of lieutenant before being demobilised three years later .

Recessions cause firms to scrap equipment ;  they also discourage new investment ,  all the more so if interest rates are high .

Startlingly bold as this idea is ,  the arguments for it were initially contained in just the first thirty - three short sections of the Principles  .

The basic problem he <head>encountered</head> was getting across why his own complete immaterialism was not itself more overtly and explicitly sceptical than the standard view that there exist both material bodies and incorporeal minds or spirits . Since ,  as the very titles of his books illustrate ,  his immaterialism was explicitly and primarily put forward as an antidote or corrective to scepticism and atheism ,  it was important that he explain this .  The Principles  is subtitled as an inquiry into the grounds of Scepticism ,  Atheism ,  and Irreligion ;  according to its preface it will be useful particularly to those who are tainted with scepticism ,  or want a demonstration of the existence and immateriality of God ,  or the natural immortality of the soul .

Whether this moral  social distinction should be reflected in the law by introducing a doctrine of manslaughter by excessive defence depends on the importance attached to the principle of fair labelling  ( see Chapter 3.3  (  l  )  )  .  It is assumed here that juries and others do attach considerable importance to the label when it is a question of homicide ,  and therefore that the excessive use of force in self - defence is a matter which is properly reflected by a separate qualified defence ,  rather than being left to sentencing  ( which means executive discretion ,  if the mandatory penalty for murder remains )  or forced artificially into the doctrine of provocation  ( when there may be no real evidence of loss of self - control )  .  The problem <head>encountered</head> in Australia , of the doctrine being too complicated for juries , was the result of a six - stage direction which the courts developed ; surely the essence of the doctrine can be conveyed more simply than that , rather than destroying it entirely .

Merkl pointed out , of course , that these other categories by no means excluded anti - Semitic feelings , which were <head>encountered</head> in around two - thirds of the biographies . In fact ,  one could go further and claim that the negative image of the Jew provided a common denominator which was able to combine and provide justification for all these ideological themes .  However ,  the figures are certainly compelling enough to suggest that features other than anti - Semitism dominated the image of the Nazi Party in the eyes of its pre - 1933 membership .

The graph line will at first rise steeply but then start to level off ,  and one can compute the likely final level and hence the number of dies .  The likely total number of dies can then be multiplied by the average number of coins per die .  Here again , however , difficult practical problems may be <head>encountered</head> , since we do not know exactly how many dies a coin die could make . We can ,  however ,  establish the correct order of magnitude from a number of sources .  The coinage of the Amphictions at Delphi in the late fourth century BC was struck from a quantity of bullion whose approximate size is known from an inscription .

It houses an elegant restaurant from which the views across the Danube to the parliament building and much of Pest are magnificent .  None of these structures competes with the others which is perhaps why they work as a trio .  ALTHOUGH the Hungarian restaurants in which I ate did achieve a far higher standard than anything I <head>encountered</head> in Prague , almost all had in common a poor sense of presentation and good ingredients were often spoiled by ignorance and negligence . A piece of venison ,  for example ,  had not been properly trimmed of its silverskin so that in cooking ,  the silverskin contracted ,  warping the meat which therefore cooked unevenly .  Where high - quality cuisine is regarded as a wicked ,  capitalist indulgence for the rich ,  it is ,  I suppose ,  inevitable ,  that the necessary skills should have decayed and lapsed .

Gay conjures up a nightmarish world ,  in which thief - takers inform on fellow criminals for the 40 reward ,  marriage for love is regarded as a family disgrace ,  and man is presented as an animal of prey .  Every one of us preys upon his neighbour ,  and yet we herd together ,  says Lockit ,  the Newgate jailer ,  and Caird 's  production memorably suggests the huddled ,  vicious humanity of London low - life .  It 's also a real pleasure to <head>encounter</head> a show with so many fine tunes . Gay added his own elegant and often ironic lyrics to traditional airs and ballads which have been atmospherically arranged by Ilona Sekacz for an excellent band .  Without the radio mikes which have become de rigueur in most musicals ,  some of the solo singing sounds a little thin ,  and it 's  a shame that Gay 's  excellent words are n't always audible .

The Campaign for Tax Relief and Childcare pressure group estimates the cost to the Treasury of exempting places in workplace nurseries from tax at 3.4 million ,  while the cost of exempting other employer subsidies such as vouchers and allowances would be 1.7 million .  Problems with childcare remain the biggest barrier to women succeeding at work .  A recent Institute of Directors ' survey of 200 successful female executives found that of the 87 per cent who claimed to have <head>encountered</head> career obstacles not experienced by male colleagues , difficulty with childcare , at 37 per cent , was the biggest factor . Relatives remain the greatest source of carers for pre - school children ;  childminders account for 26 per cent .  Joanna Foster ,  chairwoman of the Equal Opportunities Commission ,  says that while virtually every politician and company has accepted that more must be done ,  there have been more words than action :  Provision is patchy and mostly accessible only to high income groups .

A unique set of difficulties existed in Cambridgeshire .  With the development of the village colleges ,  Henry Morris had launched an unparalleled concept of the importance of educational provision as a life - long experience .  Perhaps understandably , in view of the problems he <head>encountered</head> and the opposition of some members of the county council , his concern was to establish prestigious links between village colleges and the University of Cambridge in the provision of adult education rather than with the much less regarded WEA . In June 1936 ,  Jacques met Morris in an attempt to explain the ways in which the Cambridge Board and the District were co - operating over the provision of adult education in an attempt to persuade the LEA to increase its annual grant ,  then a mere 20 .  As a result ,  Morris agreed to double the annual  grant in 193839 and to provide rooms for WEA classes in schools and colleges without charge .

This is a crucial and extremely innovative part of the Highlander education system ,  and it is worth spending a little time stressing the importance of this .  An initial reaction by the Highlander staff to an approach from a new community group may be to show them a video made by another similar community group about their own activities ,  then possibly video the reactions of the new group to what they have seen .  The experiences of other people who are in a similar situation are used to convey to the new group a sense of purpose and to reduce the feelings of helplessness and isolation which are often <head>encountered</head> . Frequently many rural communities are faced with more than their physical and geographical isolation .  There is also a cultural and intellectual isolation from those who exercise power through participating in the decision - making process ,  and the majority who are effectively excluded .

With the advent of Enterprise Training ,  providing a range of skills ,  including financial management ,  staff management ,  technical management ,  as well as craft skills ,  training entered a wider framework and came closer still to the Advisory Services ,  and the farmer would ,  in time ,  come to look on the service of the Agricultural Training Board in the same way as he currently looked on the service of his bank or advisory service .  Problems in providing efficient training were <head>encountered</head> in the remoter areas where adequate facilities were hard to find . The timing of training sessions was investigated in some depth and the importance of fitting the training to a particular time of year and to a particular size of training package at specific times of day was revealed .

Such sanctions could be implemented either by insisting that before receiving funds form the EC for a particular project the member country must ensure that the project in question complies with environmental legislation ,  or if a member country does not comply with environmental legislation across the board ,  the EC could withhold funding .  When questioned over the possibility of the EC issuing regulations  ( which must be followed exactly )  as opposed to directives  ( where the result must comply ,  but the means by which the result is obtained is not stipulated )  0 ,  the DoE pointed out that although there was a greater certainty with regard to regulation it was important to bear in mind that different countries have different administration regimes and that directly applicable regulations could ,  therefore ,  cause problems .  Collins said that he was not arguing for a regulation because it would not overcome the problems being <head>encountered</head> . Jackson agreed ,  saying that a regulation only gave the illusion of application and that a directive gives national flexibility which is very necessary .  She added that the translation of a directive into national law gives rise to difficulties and suggested that there should be an open period for the EC and national governments to argue out any differences that arise .

During the 1890s the Lower Kilcott Mill was worked by George Curtis Senior ,  with George Curtis Junior ,  operating Upper Kilcott Mill .  Water comes from the Kilcott Brook and is fed via a short penstock to the 18 diameter pitchback wheel , a design not often <head>encountered</head> in this area . The tailrace empties through a 100 yard tunnel that rejoins the stream after running under the mill house .

Unfortunately they are frequently little more than begging letters for money ,  tombola prizes and jumble or grumbles about late dinner money and parking too near the school entrances .  Fund raising is important but if newsletters are dominated by appeals for funds or materials a curious picture is created of staff priorities and interests .  There are times when we want to target specific individual or groups of parents because of minor problems which the school is <head>encountering</head> such as persistent lateness , regular late arrival of dinner money , unreturned reading books or even irregular attendance . One way of dealing with these problems is to run off a standard pro - forma ,  to fill in the blank spaces and send them off to parents .  This may well seem to be the most efficient way of utilising office time but when it comes to weighing up effectiveness the pro - forma is a non - starter as parents are antagonised by this bureaucratic and impersonal style of communication .

What is it to claim authority or to accept that someone has authority over one ?  It means to believe that one has legitimate authority ,  or that that person has authority over one .  Here we <head>encounter</head> one of the main differences between normative - explanatory accounts such as the ones offered here of authority or the later account ( in Chapter 7 ) of rights , and the purely linguistic explanations often advocated by analytic philosophers . A purely linguistic account of authority claims to yield a simple explanation of what people believe who believe that someone has legitimate authority .  Had the above account been a linguistic account ,  an explanation of the meaning of legitimate authority ,  it would have followed that anyone who believes of a person that he has legitimate authority believes that that person satisfies the condition set by the justification thesis .

The exhibition has been mounted by NHK ,  Japan 's  national broadcasting company ,  who last year made a successful documentary on Beatrix Potter and the National Trust 's  conservation work in the Lake District .

Simple endorsements of one or another nostrum are of no service to the teaching of reading .  In their quest for meaning ,  children need to be helped to become confident and resourceful in the use of a variety of reading cues .  They need to be able to recognise on sight a large proportion of the words they <head>encounter</head> and to be able to predict meaning on the basis of phonic , idiomatic and grammatical regularities and of what makes sense in context ; children should be encouraged to make informed guesses . Teachers should recognise that reading is a complex but unitary process and not a set of discrete skills which can be taught separately in turn and ,  ultimately ,  bolted together .  16.10 The environment provided by the school should promote the reading development of all pupils .

This has highlighted a number of shortcomings in the technical arrangements .  Cameras mounted on tripods proved intrusive and cumbersome ;  some chairmen and others have complained about the strong lighting ,  although most Members seem to have found the level tolerable ;  discomfort has been experienced as a result of additional heat and difficulties with ventilation  ( always a problem in summer ,  as those who have worked in the committee rooms or attended meetings there will confirm )  ;  and the sound system has not worked well .  Other problems were <head>encountered</head> , including background noise , the positioning of the shorthand writer , overcrowding in many rooms when a politically interesting meeting was being filmed , and the arrangements for covering committee meetings away from Westminster .

Most impressive of all ,  Barth has built this moving plot on one of the oldest stock properties of literature  the notion of life as a voyage .  Plotting involves by its very nature the establishment of continuity and of interconnections .  A postmodernist option , which we have <head>encountered</head> briefly in Sukenick 's fiction and now seen in Barth 's protagonists composing their story in opposition to political forces devoted to secrecy ( to a silent plot in other words ) , is developed to extraordinarily intricate lengths in the novels of Thomas Pynchon . Plotting is revised into conspiracy and placed within  the action instead of informing its structure .  Pynchon 's  characters are constantly driven by the impulse to locate themselves within larger schemes which would authenticate their own experience ,  but waver between the appalling extremes of total randomness  ( where no pattern is discernible )  and paranoia  ( where everything  is subsumed into pattern )  .

As I hastened to go upstairs , I happened to <head>encounter</head> Miss Kenton in the back corridor the scene , of course , of our last disagreement and it was perhaps this unhappy coincidence that encouraged her to maintain the childish behaviour she had adopted on that previous occasion .

Thirdly ,  as I said ,  it can be measured ,  and it is important that it should be measured in a way that is independent of moral   considerations .  We have to be able to make measurements of welfare ;  when we have done that ,  and discovered how good or poor the welfare is ,  ethical decisions have to be taken ,  and individuals will have their own ideas about what is acceptable .  The measures which we can use include indications that the animal is failing to cope with its environment ( with the difficulties which it <head>encounters</head> ) and measures of how hard it is for that individual to cope with the difficulties . So measures of poor welfare include finding that ,  because of the way an animal is kept or treated ,  it is not able to live as long or finding that it is not able to grow or is not able to breed .  These I think are self - evident ;  that you can make these measurements and that they are relevant to assessing the welfare of the animal .
