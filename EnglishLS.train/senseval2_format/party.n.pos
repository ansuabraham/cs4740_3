But they are a reality which Naipaul treats in such a way that they ,  too ,  can at times seem phantasmagorical .  Everywhere ,  transistors give off the Reggae beat ,  making the place a party that never stops ,  and that might catch fire .   A sense of mystery and futility is imparted by events at the Grange and on the Ridge , and that sense is heightened by what takes place in the city when the <head>party</head> catches fire and rioting breaks out . Politicians rush to the airport with their loot .  Then American military helicopters drift about the sky :  a show of strength which is meant to secure American interests on the island ,  to make it safe for the bauxite investment .

The majority of the Roman catholic remnant in the North still believe in a united Ireland .  They demonstrate this partially by their support for the two nationalist parties ,  Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour Party ,  though support for the latter does not necessarily imply nationalism .  Despite the official socialist tendencies of these two <head>parties</head> , a substantial number of their voters do not appear to question the maintenance of a capitalist - type class structure in a new Ireland . The Workers '  Party still fails to command many votes in elections north or south of the border .  The provisional movement is divided on the issue of capitalism but ,  for  the time at least ,  has an openly declared policy of achieving an island - wide socialist republic by the combined means of violence and the democratic process .

Despite frequently heard voices to the contrary ,  total catholic  nationalist domination would be the likely outcome of a united Ireland unless a confederal structure were implemented .  This is partly because of the structure of catholic nationalism in the Southern state and partly because the national unity sought by significant numbers of Northern catholic nationalists is still on the basis of the reversal of protestant  loyalist hegemony rather than a power compromise .

But none of these groupings ever came near to threatening the dominance of Unionist Party organization ,  much less the solidarity of protestant loyalists ,  which always appeared total on the issue of incorporation into a united ,  independent Ireland .  It was only with the Troubles ,  from 1968 ,  that unionists  broke ranks .  Yet , despite the splintering , they have succeeded in allying the present two main <head>parties</head> against the Anglo - Irish agreement of 1985 . The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland ,  formed at the time of the abolition of the Stormont parliament ,  represents those catholics ,  protestants ,  and others who disavow the twin alliance of Ireland but retain at least a practical attitude on sovereignty .

Castle catholics ,  those who found a place in the Stormont administration and developed a stake in the union ,  have also voted alliance ,  but are probably now ,  in 1989 ,  switching their allegiance to the newly found conservative associations ,  which are seeking to bring British party loyalties to Ulster .  The Northern Ireland statelet was founded on an alliance between the protestant loyalists of Ulster and British imperial and capital interests ,  particularly as represented by the conservative party .

It also set up its own scouting organizations ,  clubs both sporting and social ,  with Irish music ,  Irish dancing ,  and Irish or Gaelic games .

Priests continued to act as sponsors of the local catholic nationalist political structure , chairing meetings of the <head>party</head> and permitting the political use of the parish hall . The parish structure and school became the heart of the Northern catholic  nationalist community ,  rendering culture ,  politics ,  and religious identity as interchangeable for members of the in - group .

Conditioned by church canon law ,  participation by clerics in politics was forbidden .  But at the same time ,  an enormous sense of responsibility to protect the church ,  the family ,  and the minds and hearts of the faithful from incursions by the state was perceived to be the basic duty of the church leaders .  The leadership of the state knew in large measure what was wanted : it was part of the national popular consciousness as well as being itself a result of the convention between church and Irish parliamentary <head>party</head> in the previous century . What had been convention became part of the natural ,  common - sense universe of catholic  nationalist ideology .  No real consultation would have been necessary on that score .

We aim to show in Chapter 5 that this blindness was in part promoted by the religious elements in their beliefs .  Secondly ,  there is the problem of the Northern catholic community ,  which tends to be taken as a monolithic nationalist community .  Apart from the fact that there has been significant support for the alliance <head>party</head> over the last dozen years or so among the catholic middle classes , there is also a further factor . Rose 's   ( 1971 )  survey ,  conducted in 1968 on the verge of the Troubles ,  found that as many as 30 per cent of the catholic population were explicitly prepared to endorse the constitution of Northern Ireland ,  which then included the Stormont parliament .  Catholics ,  however ,  did not vote for the Unionist Party.

This indicates an acceptance of the state structures ,  or a recognition of a need for the separation of Northern Ireland from the remaining state structure of Ireland ,  but at the same time a continuing opposition to protestant  loyalist dominance .  One can also add that there is something in the present policies of the SDLP which suggest a need to maintain a somewhat fragile unity in respect of the national question .  Seamus Mallon , MP of the SDLP may have seen the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 as a step towards a united Ireland , but some of his co - politicians in the <head>party</head> would not share that view . Perhaps one should note the care with which the present leader of the party ,  John Hume ,  chooses his words over the future of the North .  He is careful not to promote the theme of reunification ,  but talks of discovering a new way ,  setting up structures of co - operation in the North between the two Northern Communities ,  with the support of the Southern government .

The truth of the matter probably lies somewhere in between .  As Miller argues ,  there is a long tradition among the protestants of Ulster of viewing the British state ambiguously .  It is clear that in the past many of them have considered loyalty to be a two - way process , a contract or covenant , and that the state could be a traitorous <head>party</head> as well as the people . The tradition proved of crucial importance in forming the basis for the strategy of the alliance from 1911 until British recognition of their separate political claim in 1914 .  If the tradition still exists today  and it appears that it very much does so  it implies that the United Kingdom does not have for many loyalists a natural character of statehood in the way the Southern state has for catholic nationalists .

From 1911 to 1914 ,  the Irish high clergy made successive attacks on the trade union movement and on socialism .  Rumpf and Hepburn  ( 1977 )  view the activity of the church during this period as quite decisive in limiting the appeal of socialism for the Irish subordinate classes until the 1950s .  The emergence of a new pro - capitalist <head>party</head> in the South from the end of 1985 , the Progressive Democratic Party , might show the extent to which political divisions based on the treaty and within the nationalist component of hegemony may have become problematic , to be partially replaced by an even more explicit concern with increasing the popular wealth and prosperity . Indeed ,  in the Irish general election of 1987 ,  progressive democrats took 14 seats ,  and 11.8 per cent of the total vote ,  which is sizeable for a young political party .  The decline of the labour element in the SDLP in the North ,  however ,  does indicate a trend to the style of politics in the Republic ,  that is towards the suppression of class politics and identity in line with the dominant ideology of the alliance .

The decline of the labour element in the SDLP in the North ,  however ,  does indicate a trend to the style of politics in the Republic ,  that is towards the suppression of class politics and identity in line with the dominant ideology of the alliance .  The national question as such still remains a central preoccupation for catholic nationalists .  Because the nation is seen as only partially liberated , and particularly by the membership of the largest <head>party</head> Fianna Fil , the animus of the national - popular consciousness is focused on this issue , to the detriment of class - based politics . There has ,  therefore ,  been little chance in the past for a political growth of class consciousness among subordinate groups .  What socialism there has been among the catholic  nationalist tradition has always tended to be allied to republicanism ,  especially in the period 1913 to 1930  ( Rumpf and Hepburn 1977 :  13 )  .

The dual source of the state 's  role in hegemony helps us understand the limitations of the state in respect of the alliance whose power it also represents .  This is why collections by the provisionals in public houses were having partial success in the  1970s without too much interference by the Garda ,  the Republic 's  police force .  The collections indicated a wider hidden culture of support for the lads who were at the forefront of the battle to restore national unity , in addition to the much smaller <head>party</head> political support they enjoyed in the South . The Roman catholic church ,  in episcopal statements ,  unequivocally condemns violence North or South .  As seen in Chapter 3 ,  this was also true in the nineteenth century ,  despite lower clergy support particularly for the Fenian movement .

There can be no doubt that the lack of such a programme bore heavily upon the poor ,  and that poor health and mortalities were a consequence .  In 1946 there were already signs of clerical opposition to any socialization of welfare in queries about Fianna Fil 's  proposals from Archbishop McQuaid and the Confederation of Convent Schools .  As has already been seen , it was the style of both church and politicians to avoid their mutual consultations being known , which tells us that the secularity of the state at that time was partially a faade , but one which it was felt by both interested <head>parties</head> had to be maintained , probably so as not to confuse the faithful . In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 ,  while an extensive health bill was going through parliament ,  the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority ,  without qualification ,  is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family ,  the Church in education ,  the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions  (  Irish Independent  ,  12 Apr. 1951 ,  quoted Whyte 1980 :  143 )  .  It appeared that one of the main sources of the bishops '  opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation .

The next significant event of constitutional relevance was the important initiative taken by the nationalist parties in Ireland in 19834 ,  the New Ireland Forum .  This was an initiative sponsored by the SDLP at first intended to bring together politicians from both catholic  nationalist and protestant  loyalist groups to discuss the future of the island as a whole .  In reality only the major nationalist <head>parties</head> participated . Loyalist parties refused to join in ,  and the Provisional Sinn Fein was excluded by the fact that the ground rules for the forum only allowed parties accepting constitutional ,  nonviolent politics to participate .  The forum completed its consultations and reported in the Summer of 1984 .

The new Ireland must be a society within which ,  subject only to public order ,  all cultural ,  political and religious beliefs can be freely expressed and practised .  This was made explicit in terms of the sense of British identity which protestant loyalists experience :  This implies in particular ,  in respect of Northern protestants ,  that the civil and religious liberties that they uphold and enjoy will be fully protected and their sense of Britishness accommodated  ( New Ireland Forum 19834 :  i .  223 )  .  For the very first time , the leadership of all the major constitutional nationalist <head>parties</head> in Ireland , representing 90 per cent of the nationalist population , had abandoned the concept of the tyranny of the majority will . The people of Ireland were not identified as the catholic  nationalist population .  There were still traces of ethnocentrism in the nationalist viewpoint elsewhere in the report :  for instance ,  they still referred to the historic integrity  of Ireland  ( New Ireland Forum 19834 :  i .  28 )  ,  implying an almost naturalistic concept of Irish unity ,  when as a political unit Ireland only ever existed as a British - administered territory .

Divorce was seen to be harder on the women than the men ,  who could get out of their family  responsibilities so much more easily with divorce than without it .  In opposing the arguments marshalled by the anti - divorce groups ,  the pro - divorce group argued that ,  despite the existence of divorce legislation in Northern Ireland ,  there was still a low divorce rate .  The period of separation in undefended cases was two years , and five years had to run if one of the <head>parties</head> opposed the divorce . That men in particular do not benefit from the procedures was suggested by the fact that twice as many women as men filed for divorce .  It was argued that the pattern in other countries was that laws permitting divorce followed social trends in the numbers of marriage breakdowns rather than vice versa and that the fears of societal breakdown promoted by opponents in Ireland were unfounded in fact .

Further criticism came from Roman catholics in Britain .  An editorial in the Catholic Herald and Standard  on 25 May  it is distributed in Ireland as The Standard   criticized the Irish bishops '  apparently  low esteem of their laity 's  ability to remain constant in their marriages .  Also a call from the Alliance Party in the North was made by John Cushnahan , <head>party</head> leader . He found it ironic that anyone who supported the Anglo - Irish Agreement could oppose a modest measure to introduce divorce  (  Irish Times  ,  28 June 1986 )  .

They stared at one another in dismay , the sad , small wickedness of their friends and neighbours strewn around their minds like dirty confetti from a <head>party</head> long past . Henry Phipps had been the chief celebrant at this particular form of get - together ,  and now someone had brought his priapic revels to a rather spectacular end .  Constable Arthur Perkins was a phlegmatic man ,  resigned long ago to losing his hair and his prospects for promotion as he worked out his years in an area singularly free of serious crime .

No one had thought to specify how many shirt buttons could be undone and fear was now patently manifest that some uncontrollable disorder would be let loose should more than one button be opened to reveal chest hair ,  or even a medallion .

Four years later , as I mentioned above , I was <head>party</head> to the same fear at Bramshill , in relation to the use of the Nato sweater . One of my colleagues ,  no doubt swayed by the heat of the discussion ,  turned on me sitting in my short - sleeved uniform shirt ,  and rebuked me with the warning that in my force ,  you 'd be disciplined for mutilating police property .  Initially I was puzzled ,  until I realized he thought I had cut off my shirt sleeves ,  for in his force  ( noted for its disciplined enforcement of a correct uniform presentation )  ,  all uniform shirts had long sleeves .

For all his organisational and business efficiency ,  he was a man of immense personal charm and dignity :  Well - dressed ,  aristocratic ,  calm ,  and with a ready and reassuring smile ,  it was said .

Super Super Series !

One theory is there should be Sydney ,  a week earlier than at present ,  leading into the Australian Open ,  the Stella Artois Championships as the traditional prelude to Wimbledon ,  plus Cincinnati and Indianapolis on the way into the U.S. Open .  Rather more controversial would be deciding which tournament should take pride of place in the European clay court season leading into Paris .

No matter whether the theme comes from fantasy or reality every movement should be lightly or firmly drawn into an overall dance design .  lt must also delineate the personalities and behaviour of the characters .  These designs can reveal people at play during a <head>party</head> as in Les Rendezvous or on an ice - rink as in Les Patineurs ; they present the conflicting or subtle moods arising from the tragedy of lost youth and hope during war - time , as in Gloria ; or they show how deep sorrow gradually changes into resignation and on to exaltation as in Requiem . There can be great variety within some themes .  For example ,  Balanchine in his Four Temperaments   ( with music by Hindemith )  describes the moods of a melancholic ,  sanguine ,  phlegmatic and choleric man or woman .

Foreign lagers are welcomed by CAMRA ,  despite the fact that many of these are not real .  The Party Seven is a great British institution and its downfall merely a product of marketing mismanagement .  It is recognised universally as a free invitation to any <head>party</head> , and as a postmodern display of pop art in its most popular and utilitarian form . Fizzy keg beer it may be ,  but that is no reason to dismiss it out of hand without considering its appeal as a true classic beer .  With the strength of CAMRA as a consumer movement ,  I welcome the return of the Party Seven into the off - sales world ,  which is one of the largest sections of the industry ,  as the large breweries are forcing the 2 pint upon tenant landlords and others ,  and people turn elsewhere to seek their alcoholic enjoyment .

Poet and visionary climber Edwin Drummond is about to achieve his ambition of a United Nations Climb for the World ,  now sponsored by the Sheffield firm Fretwell - Downing Datasystems .  The big event is scheduled for 2122 September ,  its object the raising of funds for environmental projects worldwide .  The main climb by several <head>parties</head> on the North Face , West Flank , Mittellegi Ridge and South Ridge of the Eiger will see the meeting of an international team on the summit , televised live . Participants ,  who will carry symbolic lanterns and a flag of flags ,  include a blind person ,  a Czech grandmother ,  a black South African archaeologist ,  a Siberian and an Argentinian model .  The Eiger ,  Drummond hopes ,  having been claimed by Hitler after the Nordwand climb of 1936 ,  will thus become a world mountain .

The hostel even had its own fleet of camels on its regular Hillaby - style treks ,  used them to carry supplies or provide a mount for weary walkers .

Instead of accompanying us ,  he carried the Bulgarian bodily down to the refuge .  Three down ,  five to go .  In truth , a guide was n't really necessary for our <head>party</head> that good - weather day . The route was obvious ,  we were all experienced and we were not exactly alone .  But it was still comforting to have with us little Liena ,  our 19 - year - old interpreter who was a very competent rock climber and all - round mountaineer ,  for she had climbed Elbrus in the past and could give assurance that we were on the right course .

She held the lead and quietly plodded upward through the crisp snow that covered the long Baskan Glacier .

It was a world of pristine beauty and breathless calm  all the wind was beyond the ridge  and I revelled in it .

We turned and descended slowly to the tracks we had made on the ascent earlier that morning ,  then sloughed our way down. Twenty minutes later we met our guide ,  seated in the snow making radio contact with the hut .  Having delivered the injured Bulgarian to safety we had then returned to the ascent , hoping to catch our <head>party</head> . He and Liena conversed for a while before he announced his decision to wait there for the return of Tony and Ferdy  ( the Germans )  ,  and Dave the American ,  asking me to take care of Liena on the way down.

Perhaps unwittingly ,  the new statue hints at a deeper truth underpinning the hardline triumph :  the worker ,  the peasant and the intellectual gaze wistfully towards the Forbidden City ,  the grandest monument to the genius of Chinese civilisation ,  but the soldier has his eyes fixed in a different direction  down the Avenue of Eternal Peace towards Zhongnanhai ,  the walled compound where party leaders live and work .  For as Mao decreed , if power grows from the barrel of a gun , it is the <head>party</head> that must control , and if necessary use , that gun . Four months after the People 's  Liberation Army stormed central Peking with the loss of hundreds of lives ,  few can have any doubt about the party 's  determination to enforce this Maoist maxim .  As many as 100,000 soldiers are still encamped around Peking .

But if they are physically weak ,  the old guard remain politically strong .  Refighting the battles of their own youth ,  they have tried to fix China 's  eyes firmly on the past .  The <head>party</head> may claim to be in the vanguard of history , but its clock seems to have stopped in the 1950s . Propaganda campaigns ,  class struggle ,  the cult of the model worker and even the almost evangelical rhetoric of the cold war are all back with a vengeance .  Television and newspapers no longer praise model entrepreneurs but heroic labourers such as Zhang Fuxin ,  praised for throwing himself into a pit of polluted mud to retrieve a piece of equipment .

From ANDREW HIGGINS in Peking CHINA'S leaders celebrated the 40th anniversary of Communist rule yesterday ,  protected from their people by the biggest security operation undertaken in the capital since the People 's  Liberation Army stormed into Peking four months ago. Standing exactly where Mao Tse - tung proclaimed the People 's Republic of China on 1 October 1949 , paramount leader Deng Xiaoping joined other <head>party</head> leaders atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace to preside over a night of fireworks and martial music in Tiananmen Square . Fearful of protests or violence by citizens outraged by the army 's  brutal assault on Tiananmen on 4 June ,  armed troops cordoned off a large area of central Peking ,  admitting only hand - picked spectators into the square .  Among the guests were thousands of plain - clothes police and out - of - uniform soldiers ,  some of whom arrived in military trucks ,  dressed as clowns .

His faction has triumphed over the reformist elements of Christian Democracy ,  headed by the ousted leader and premier ,  Ciriaco De Mita .  In the sweetness of victory ,  Mr Andreotti 's  Roman cohorts have forgotten that they are mortal and ,  in the eyes of many churchmen ,  their greed and arrogance now risk bringing Catholic politics into disrepute .  The Pope 's Vicar of Rome , Cardinal Ugo Poletti , has taken to scolding the Christian Democrats for their divisions which may bring victory for the secular <head>parties</head> and the Communists in city elections on 29 October . A public rift in Catholic politics surfaced last week when the Communion and Liberation movement severed its ties with a powerful weekly magazine ,  Il Sabato ,  run by Andreotti supporters .  The magazine exploited popular Catholic themes ,  such as anti - abortion campaigning and family values to channel middle - class resentment into a political movement .

Tixier - Vignancour 's  success in retricting General Salan 's  punishment to life imprisonment in 1968 so angered President de Gaulle that he considered resignation .

Without any proper <head>party</head> organisation he fought a brilliant campaign in 1965 , canvassing the French throughout August on every beach from Dunkirk to Menton . He was eliminated in the first round ,  coming fourth behind de Gaulle ,  Mitterrand and Jean Lecanuet .

In many of them ,  particularly criminal cases ,  the interests of the client may be quite different from those of the public .

In the second category , general civil cases , <head>parties</head> should be able to choose their own lawyers because the interests of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's right of choice .

But Dr Runcie 's  ideas of a limited primacy  recognising the Pope as a central figure in the Christian Church ,  who would exercise a primacy for the sake of unity and mission  have been rejected as insufficient by the Pope .

Though Dr Runcie and his <head>party</head> could not take Holy Communion at the papal mass , he had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the Anglican church in Rome after three demonstrators rose from the congregation as he ascended the pulpit ; the visit has been dogged by protests from supporters of the Rev Ian Paisley . In his sermon ,  Dr Runcie said :  We should ever recognise the scandal that Anglicans and Roman Catholics must celebrate two eucharists to make one memorial of our redemption on the day of our Lord .  Dr Runcie has gone out of his way on this visit to concede many of the doctrinal points and practices which large elements of the Church of England have traditionally found offensive in Roman Catholicism .

His speechwriting aides confessed themselves stumped for a Kinnockism worthy of inclusion in a dictionary of modern political quotations .

His speechwriting aides confessed themselves stumped for a Kinnockism worthy of inclusion in a dictionary of modern political quotations .  The best they could recall was his one - liner to Derek Hatton ,  the Liverpool militant ,  at Bournemouth in 1985 :  You do n't play politics with people 's  jobs ,  Mr Kinnock told him. But that falls into the somewhat different category of intra - <head>party</head> polemic . I am talking about phrases which speak to the country by capturing its mood or its hopes .  Harold Wilson 's  words are remembered today ,  25 years after he led Labour back to power ,  from 13 wilderness years .

If it did not exist ,  would anyone trouble to invent it at a time when ,  from the Atlantic to the Urals ,  socialism in all its manifestations is losing the argument to liberal capitalism ?  For we should not become too carried away by Labour 's  changed face and tone of voice ,  nor too dazzled by the Peter Mandelson image - conjuring .  The <head>party</head> may have put on a collar and tie but it is still the Labour Party , prone to its old reflexes ( as it reminded us yesterday on defence spending ) , prisoner still of its anachronistic structure , its mind set in 100 years of working - class history . Listening to the first day 's  proceedings ,  I found myself not transported into the future so much as revisiting the past .  Here was the Labour Party reverting to its old self ,  a better self ,  yes ,  than the monster it became under the demonic spell of Tony Benn ;  here was a party responsive once more to its own people ,  the people it so shamefully betrayed at two successive general elections since 1979 ,  but a party  as somebody once said of the SDP  -  promising a better yesterday .

Much determination and hard work have gone into that attempt ,  but it is now seen to have failed .  Without reforms ,  failure will become more complete .  Yet if the GDR were to become a multi - <head>party</head> democracy , it would lose its identifying ideology and become a pallid shadow of the Federal Republic : less grossly consumerist , perhaps , but also less desirable . In Bonn it is hoped that there can be orderly change across the border ,  soon enough to convince more East Germans that life is worth living there .  Perhaps because to think about reform is to think about its purposes ,  Mr Honecker and his colleagues keep their minds closed to such challenges .

We naturally welcome Labour 's  existing promise to repeal Section 28 and to legislate against discrimination in the workplace .  And few would disagree that ,  given the fanaticism and sheer ferocity of tabloid prejudice ,  it would be unreasonable for gay people to expect that Labour should adopt our cause as an election issue .  However , the watering down of a basic and principled commitment , within Labour or any other libertarian <head>party</head> , especially in response to intimidation by newspapers of such a spurious morality , could prove deeply discrediting . It is with regard to this principle ,  but more importantly to the actual facts of persecution ,  that we urge the support of Labour 's  leaders and membership by restoring ,  this week ,  a policy commitment to full equality for lesbians and gay men .

It has not always been easy for those working class voters who see the Greens as an undisciplined bunch ,  inimical to the interests of industrial society ,  to keep up with the SPD 's  enthusiastic appetite for environmental matters .

Oskar Lafontaine ,  the SPD leader in the Saarland ,  has argued vociferously that a modern mass party like the SPD could not afford to have its policies confined to the narrow interests of employed industrial workers .  In the party 's  new programme ,  the trade unions have had to backtrack on their central demand ,  now accepting that a shorter working week will mean reduced wages .  But Mr Lafontaine , standard - bearer of the up - and - coming generation , and the second most important figure after Mr Vogel on the committee drafting the <head>party</head> programme for the next decade , has certainly not had things all his own way . His attempts to link reductions in working hours to more flexible work practices ,  for example ,  have run into powerful union resistance .  The SPD 's  candidate for Chancellor seems to be narrowing to a choice between Mr Vogel and Mr Lafontaine ,  between a cautious compromiser and an erratic reformer .

The party is far from sure which message it wants to send to voters ,  and is likely to leave the choice until the last minute .  Neither of these two men can control with any certainty ,  however ,  the factor that will perhaps exert the most influence on the SPD 's  election chances .  Whether the <head>party</head> likes it or not , its fortunes are hostage to the still youthful coalitions in Frankfurt and Berlin , and their notoriously unpredictable Green allies . If these coalitions fall apart ,  as an earlier version did in Hesse in 1987 amid much rancour ,  the repercussions could be disastrous ,  with the Christian Democrats poised to exploit any hint of red - green chaos .  If we are not successful in Berlin ,  then the chances of a red - green coaliion in Bonn are gone for five to ten years ,  says Walter Momper .

Despite his lack of political experience ,  Clouthier 's  20 - year leadership of business organisations stood him in good stead .  After the banks '  nationalisation he sold most of his interests in the dozen or so companies he had created and drawn his wealth from ,  and committed himself to combating the existing political system .  He quickly established himself within the PAN , challenging its professional politicians with the support of his business colleagues and unifying the fractious <head>party</head> . He took conservative ideas on privatisation and land reform ,  gave them a populist anti - government bent and managed to woo over many poorer voters  -  especially in northern Mexico  who previously feared that the PAN represented only business interests .

If that sounded a bit like the result of an army medical board it was appropriate enough :  the chief purpose of this year 's  conference is to signal that the Labour Party is ready once more for active service .  Indeed , Mr Kinnock called for a modest celebration at Labour 's recovery : it was an encouragement , an inspiration to see the <head>party</head> working together once more , he said . This was his way of declaring that the battle for the Labour Party was won and the Battle for Britain about to commence .

Not badly at all , given the immense difficulty of restoring credibility to Labour as a <head>party</head> of government . Mr Kinnock staggers under the additional handicap of having no ministerial experience which would equip him for the supreme office to which he aspires .

Today he has shed a good deal of that ideology  his speech yesterday was social democratic through and through  but he remains devoid of the work experience relevant to his next task which is to convince the country that he ,  and Labour ,  are qualified to form the next government .  The most successful feature of his speech was his recruitment of the future to Labour 's  cause .  All elections in two - <head>party</head> parliamentary systems are essentially about whether or not it is time for a change . Yesterday Mr Kinnock presented a picture of a world changing so rapidly around the present government that the Prime Minister had become out of touch ,  out of date and out of step with the British people .  As she enters her second decade in power ,  this promises to be an effective line of attack .

He was replying to demands that he should resign to pave the way for talks between the Pakistan - based mujahedin resistance and Kabul 's  ruling Peoples Democratic Party  ( PDPA )  on a peace settlement .  The President said that if the United States and Pakistan were really serious in wishing to settle the Afghan problem they should acknowledge the new reality in Afghanistan ,  where seven months after the departure of Soviet troops the PDPA had become more united and strengthened ,  while the guerrillas were in total disarray .

To carry out a wholesale purge of the party apparatus ,  Mao appointed Chen as head of the Cultural Revolution Group ,  a kitchen cabinet of loyal disciples ,  including Mao 's  wife Jiang Qing ,  that was to lead the assault on the party hierarchy .

Given a relatively lenient sentence of 18 years  ( Jiang Qing and others were given suspended death sentences )  ,  Chen was later released from jail in consideration of age and poor health .

Mr Livingstone argued that the move towards unity was merely the normal pre - election loyalty which the <head>party</head> usually showed ; the only difference this time was that it was happening 18 months earlier than normal . But the Labour Co - ordinating Committee said that there was clear evidence of a cultural change .  The oppositionist politics of the 1970s and early 1980s are over .

People want national executive members who are independent of the leadership ,  but not destructively critical ,  Mike Craven ,  its vice - chairman ,  said .  Between 30 and 50 per cent of constituency management committees voluntarily consulted their full membership before casting their votes .  The evidence showed , according to Mr Craven , that wherever individual <head>party</head> members were given the one member , one vote opportunity to voice their views , they rejected the hard left . There can be no doubt now that one member ,  one vote ballots will become compulsory .  Mr Livingstone agreed that the spread of individual ballots had undermined his vote .

Mr Livingstone agreed that the spread of individual ballots had undermined his vote .  I would have survived if one member ,  one vote had not been introduced in the constituency section ,  he said .  Its extension would now oblige the left to find new ways of campaigning among <head>party</head> members , because they tended to cast their votes according to what they saw on television . But the most convincing demonstration of the spread of change is that support was withdrawn from Mr Livingstone in every part of the country except London .  His vote was more than halved in the party 's  northern region ,  and nearly halved in both Yorkshire and the north - west .

In his keynote speech , the Labour leader said it was an inspiration to see the <head>party</head> working together in support of its policy objectives . It is not an empty claim to say that this conference is one of progress ,  indeed one of celebration ,  not of relaxation or complacency .

The <head>party</head> was not only telling itself , but exuding to the British public the feeling that we are fit to serve our country , he said . Its advances in the local and European elections this year had shown the tide was turning towards Labour .  Increasingly ,  the Prime Minister was seen by the public to be working against political trends ,  both at home and abroad .

It is the best way to serve the people we want to stand up for .  And we will keep on winning with no wheeling ,  no dealing ,  no horse - trading and no electoral pacts .  Labour would go on getting the public 's support by constructing strong unity of purpose and by its conduct as a serious , socialist , self - disciplined <head>party</head> , Mr Kinnock told delegates . The policy review had produced relevant and practical answers that offered the kind of socialism the British people understood and supported .  It was the kind of socialism that insisted the NHS was not split up or sold off ,  that resented the injustice of the poll tax ,  and opposed the centralisation ,  control and censorship which had eroded civil liberties over the last 10 years .

By COLIN BROWN ,  Political Correspondent A PROFOUND shift away from the Tory Party among women voters was taking place ,  but many women still believed the Labour Party was too male - dominated ,  Clare Short warned the conference yesterday .  Ms Short , the Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood , gave the warning as the conference agreed to give women a higher profile in the <head>party</head> with a 40 per cent quota for women on all <head>party</head> committees and local <head>party</head> delegations . Ms Short said the women 's  vote could help Labour to win the next general election provided more women could be persuaded that Labour was sensitive to women 's  demands .  She said a majority of women had voted Tory since they got the right to vote ,  but a profound shift was now taking place .

Women saw British society as too unequal ,  too competitive ,  too materialistic and too greedy .  Women wanted more equality ,  more social services ,  fewer weapons and less pollution .  But Ms Short added : Women share our values but we are seen by these women as male dominated and the most unsympathetic of all the <head>parties</head> . This debate should recognise our concern to put this right with more women at all levels .  But some women campaigners later protested that the debate ,  chaired by David Blunkett ,  had been rigged to silence their objections .

But if members of Labour 's  Philosophical Tendency ,  from Tony Benn to Bryan Gould ,  are choosing their words carefully it may be through fear of how they will look in each other 's  diaries .  Weary constituency and trade union delegates ,  queuing for a cup of tea and a sandwich ,  constantly risk ending up with a signed copy of someone 's  memoirs .  Around the Brighton Conference Centre , academic tracts on the <head>party</head> 's past and future course seem to proliferate daily . To a fevered imagination ,  it seems no one can turn a corner in the crowded conference complex without running into a mug shot of one or other high - theoretician leering pensively from a wall of hardback dust covers .  Their debate on Labour 's  plight rages far above the brawling oratory in the conference hall .

By ANTHONY BEVINS ,  Political Editor NEIL KINNOCK yesterday set investment in education and training as his top priority :  the commanding height to be scaled by the next Labour government .  In his address to the <head>party</head> conference at Brighton , Mr Kinnock said Labour was now ready , eager and able to take power from the Conservatives at the next election , and his confidence won him one of the most prolonged and enthusiastic ovations received by a Labour leader for many years . His attack on the Conservative government ,  given added impact by passages of scathing wit ,  also included an analysis of Margaret Thatcher 's  out - of - touch ,  out - of - date foreign policy .  Identifying her attitude to the emerging democracies of the Soviet bloc ,  disarmament ,  South Africa ,  the environment ,  Third World debt ,  and the EC ,  Mr Kinnock said :  Margaret Thatcher shows that she 's  from the Greta Garbo school of diplomacy .

I want to be alone .  That 's  the constant theme .  Colleagues said last night that the speech marked a change of gear as Mr Kinnock moved away from <head>party</head> organisation and policy and accelerated into the election campaign . Lord Callaghan ,  the last Labour prime minister ,  said :  What happened in the 1980s was a temporary aberration from what has always been the real position of the Labour Party ,  and Neil Kinnock has recaptured the traditional position .  But Mr Kinnock stressed in his speech that given the inevitable and unprecedented mess which would be left behind by Mrs Thatcher ,  a Labour government would have to set  and unflinchingly stick to  four basic priorities .

Warning that there was no single mechanism which would catapult Britain to economic strength ,  Mr Kinnock said :  Research and development ,  transport and communications ,  science ,  education and training ;  they are the priorities .  They are the productive base of our economy .  They were prerequisites an unparalleled priority for dealing with inflation , the balance of payments deficit , unemployment , and funding the <head>party</head> 's policies for social justice . Having delivered his tough message ,  Mr Kinnock turned to prime targets of the Conservative record  topped off with high interest rates ,  which he likened to a policy of assassination for mortgage - holders .  Even if the Conservatives took the brakes off in the run - up to the next election ,  people would not be deceived .
