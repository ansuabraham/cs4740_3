I 'm supposed to be an usher  or an usherette in my case ,  I suppose .  Forgive me .  I think I must be <head>missing</head> something . Why do n't you want to go back inside ,  where all the fun is ?  It went quiet again .

Green eyes .  Her eyes were also grey like stones through clear water .  Pre - Astrid , Jay had been in a dead job , art workshops with utterly disillusioned teenagers , every morning she coughed she rang in sick , malingering Mondays , rain seeped in the doors of the empty bus every morning , the bus to the High Street for the next bus , hoping to be early enough to <head>miss</head> the screaming leering sneering schoolgirls she had to face all day . She was a washed - out wash - out ,  Miss ,  why 're you such a div  ?  After she fell in love with Astrid ,  she became Dragonfly Moonchild ,  the world her oyster ,  and for the first time on the daily journey ,  she saw an adventure playground over the hoardings by the Elephant and Castle ,  and all the poles were painted like a carousel .

Charlie Chester obligingly broadcast the appeal on Radio 2 .  The IEE has tried to negotiate with Thomson ,  offering help with writing and publishing his biography in time for the fiftieth anniversary of Blumlein 's  death in June 1992 .  But Thomson has rejected the IEE 's offers and it now looks certain that the anniversary will be <head>missed</head> . Some members want the IEE now to use more muscle ,  with threats of expulsion from the Institution ,  if Thomson does not at least provide a catalogue of the material he has collected and give rock solid guarantees on its long term security ,  after his death .

The data in Table I  ( drawn from work published by B R McLeod and Abraham Liboff )  assumes that H is exclusively the geomagnetic field strength .  Doubling the frequency saves lives I am aware of the extensive experimental research which has focused on ion forms involving Ca++ Na+ etc2 , but what seems to have been <head>missed</head> in this prior research is the appreciation that water forms its own ion form in that it dissociates into hydroxyl and hydronium ions as listed on the table . It would seem that the prevalence of such ions and their rather special relationship to the 50Hz and 60Hz frequencies ,  both of which they encompass by their combined effect ,  and as illustrated in Table I ,  has to give the underlying basis for field induced activity in body fluids .  However ,  this is not a critical point .

Meanwhile riots continue to scar the Dutch League ;  one match was abandoned recently in Rotterdam .  The Ajax case emphasises the danger to players ,  especially goalkeepers .  Two years ago there was a similar , arguably worse , incident in Madrid when Real supporters threw sharp metal rods from behind a goal at the Bernabeu , narrowly <head>missing</head> Bayern Munich 's keeper , Jean - Marie Pfaff . He could have been killed .  Real 's  punishment was to play subsequent matches behind closed doors .

The League appear to be saying that the difference between scrapping and cynical wounding is just three matches .  The other club to fall foul of the disciplinary committee yesterday was St Helens ,  who travel to Wakefield tomorrow without Roy Haggerty and Stuart Evans ,  both banned for four matches .  They were dismissed against Oldham last week , Evans in the final minute of a 36 - 6 defeat , after <head>missing</head> the start of the season through injury . Evans ,  like Haggerty ,  is not in the Saints side for his cerebral contribution ,  though there was evidence against New Zealand last week that the giant prop is at last gaining an understanding of his league potential .  The Kiwi tour continues at Wigan ,  where after the Oldham upset ,  the home side need a confidence booster almost as badly as the visitors ,  whose efforts so far have been disjointed .

Becker and Graf won Wimbledon and the US Open and did not get their pictures on the front cover of any non - tennis magazines here .  Becker 's  photograph was in the German newspapers yesterday ,  accompanied by lamentations about his physical condition after a knee injury had caused him to abandon the Classic on Thursday .  They were not taking the hero for granted , but <head>missing</head> him madly and praying that he would be fit to return for the Davis Cup . The feeling was mutual .  The Davis Cup is definitely the biggest highlight of the rest of the year for me ,  Becker said .

That the party and unions should set the level of fines that recalcitrant unions would incur .  So it all comes down ,  two years before the election ,  to stating the level of fines .  He seems to have <head>missed</head> my statement three weeks ago that fines would be deterrent , sufficient to secure compliance with the law. He then argues that it is not sufficient  ( for me )  to tell the conference that there will be no return to mass picketing .  Actually ,  I never mentioned picketing ,  mass picketing or otherwise ,  in my speech ,  but let that pass .

Umberto Eco himself clearly sympathises .  Belbo 's  iffy relationship with the evasive Lorenza Pelegrini is is deftly touched in ,  and his reminiscences of a wartime childhood in Piedmont are the only passages to achieve any distinction or elegance of style ,  or any vestige of human interest .  It is worth skipping through the rest just to read them , but their bearing on the story proper Belbo is a man who <head>missed</head> his moment , and conspiracy theory is the refuge of the disappointed is specious . If Foucault 's  Pendulum fails as a novel ,  does it work as an intellectual game ?  The ancient manuscript which sparks it all off is ingeniously devised to yield two possible meanings ,  one mystic ,  one mundane .

He also birdied the 11th ,  but then dropped his only shot of the round at the 12th ,  after playing a poor bunker shot and missing from 15 feet .  He also missed three from inside six feet .  Davis Love III , the American , slipped from second place with a one - over - par 73 for 138 , and another American , Mark Calcavecchia , <head>missed</head> the cut for the second successive tournament .
