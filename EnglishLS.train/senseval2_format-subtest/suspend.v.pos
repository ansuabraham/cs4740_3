Lyricism can indeed be very like this description of it .  Poetry has often been a form of self - pity and a means of self - advancement ,  and it has often pretended otherwise :  Kundera 's  book rumbles such pretence ,  as in the comedy he stages of an embassy of poets to a college of policemen and a debate there about the aesthetic of the socialist love - poem .  But he does all this at the cost of <head>suspending</head> a due sense of the tendency there has also been for poets to see further than their noses , and to speak out , and to go to the wall for it . His Postscript evokes the aim of a white - coated Doctor Kundera to solve an aesthetic problem :  how to write a novel which would be a critique of poetry and yet at the same time would itself be poetry .  This aim has a sweepingness and a suspendingness which are apparent ,  too ,  in the novel to which it relates .

The British Theatre Association ,  mentioned in the first edition of this book ,  has for decades offered professional and all - embracing training courses for actors ,  directors ,  and young people .  It is currently ,  in 1990 ,  fighting for its life .  Due to lack of governmental or any other official support this unique and valuable organisation has had to <head>suspend</head> its training activities temporarily , whilst trying to secure for itself a sound and permanent financial basis for the future . It is hoped that courses on a limited basis may restart in the Autumn of 1990 .  Meanwhile ,  the BTA is still the custodian of the finest theatre library in Europe .

The market signals proved totally wrong as Dead Certain drifted out ominously in the betting and Chimes Of Freedom was backed as if defeat was not even a remote possibility .  Money cascaded on to Henry Cecil 's  filly ,  including one individual bet of 50,000 to 55,000 ,  but in the end she was even edged out of second place by Line Of Thunder .  The reason for the apparent lack of confidence was clearly the fact that Elsworth had <head>suspended</head> operations for some while because of coughing in his yard and had not had a winner for almost six weeks . Dead Certain had been as badly affected as any ,  but Elsworth simply would not run a horse of that class in such a race unless he believed it was capable of giving of its best .  I think she had done enough at the end and it was beginning to hurt ,  Elsworth said .

A more common problem in timber upper floors and <head>suspended</head> ground floors is the rotting of joist - ends above built - in wallplates . When untreated timber  ( ie ,  wood which has not been impregnated with preservative )  is built into solid walls ,  it has no protection from dampness in the wall and it is common for joist - ends to be shielded by a skin of brickwork only a half - a - brick thick  ( Fig 31 )  .  Such joist - ends will decay if their moisture content remains over 20 per cent for long periods .

Earlier yesterday ,  the Court of Appeal refused an application by Mr Goodwin 's  employers ,  the publishers Morgan Grampian ,  to revoke the order forcing him to hand over notes containing confidential financial information concerning a company ,  which cannot be named for legal reasons .

Throughout the late 1970s ,  tens of thousands of dolphins were killed by Turkish hunters each year .  In 1980 ,  the catch exceeded 54,000 animals ,  but in 1981 fell to about 10,000 ,  with harbour porpoises rather than dolphins comprising most of the catch .  The populations of dolphins and porpoises were finally on the verge of total collapse when the Turkish Government <head>suspended</head> the hunt in 1983 , and commissioned a report on the populations of dolphins and their effects on fish stocks . Although the report was due in 1987 ,  it has not yet been presented .  Turkey is a signatory to the Berne Convention ,  which prohibits indiscriminate killing of cetaceans .

So this is an odd time to let the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade wither ,  or to be thinking of dismantling the post - 1945 multilateral trading system in favour of a slide to managed trade and protection .  Of all the risks that face the world economy over the next few months ,  the most easily avoidable is this threat of trade war .  The European Community and America need to resume the GATT talks at once , patch up their quarrel over farm trade , and conclude the agreements on services and other issues that had seemed within reach when the talks were <head>suspended</head> . Then ,  equally important ,  George Bush must sell that deal to Congress with far more enthusiasm than his officials have lately shown for the multilateral approach to trade reform .  For the rest ,  the best advice for economic policy - makers is to recall two principles of sound central banking  one forgotten in the 1930s and the other in the 1970s .
