German art historians had begun much more systematically on this task than others .  Several art historians wrote syntheses of art historical information ,  which became standard works .  Histories of art <head>appeared</head> in sequences of volumes by different authors , there were several series of books about artists and on museum collections , besides which the most comprehensive biographical dictionary of artists by Ulrich Thieme and Felix Becker started its long publication process in 1907 . Roger Fry acknowledged German scholarship as a precursor of serious art historical studies in this century .  Fry was a connoisseur of Renaissance art ,  but also he defended Post - Impressionism  ( a term he invented )  ,  was a painter ,  and published a monograph on Czanne .

He asserted that a modern artist should be in tune with his times ,  careful to avoid hackneyed subjects .  Typically ,  a laudatory essay he wrote was called The Painter of Modern Life  on the subject of the illustrator Constantin Guys ;  this gifted if minor artist was accurately targeted by Baudelaire as being in the mainstream of contemporary social and political life .  Guys ' drawings <head>appeared</head> in such papers as the Illustrated London News , a very successful venture begun in 1842 , the decade which also saw the founding of satirical journals like Punch or Kladderadatsch . The illustrated periodical was a phenomenon of a world which Baudelaire saw as reborn on Guys '  paper :  Natural and more than natural ,  beautiful and more than beautiful ,  strange and endowed with an impulsive life like the soul of its creator

Giacometti was an artist with very different artistic aims ,  clearly expounded by Valerie J. Fletcher in a catalogue for an exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden ,  Washington ,  in 1988 .  Writing about a small bust on a column ,  a thin sculpture in a series of four busts of which the others were fuller in form ,  she comments that the extremely thin proportions of the head contrast with the solidity of the base .  So delicately modulated are the forms of the head that the human element <head>appears</head> ephemeral . This tenuous fragility contrasts with the three later busts on a stele ,  which have substantial anatomical forms .  The sculptor had decided that he wanted this bust to confront the observer .

These examples of catalogues containing helpful art criticism could be contrasted with many others which are limited to lists of exhibitions ,  details of the artist 's  career ,  and entries for the works displayed .  There are other hazards for the readers of catalogues .  Some publications are less impartial than they might <head>appear</head> , erring on the side of generosity . Museums with exhibitions of art from other countries are especially likely to be respectful in commentaries on works of art which have been borrowed .  All the same ,  museum curators will have carried out a critical task in selecting the exhibition ,  in some instances having fended off proposals for inclusions with a political or a particular cultural bias .

The affair seems to him to belong to the town ,  to have no future ,  and they are parted when the town comes under fear and hazard .  He finds himself considering the idea of flight ,  and the idea of defeat :  1 suppose that ,  thinking of my own harassment and Raymond 's  defeat ,  I had begun to consider Yvette a defeated person as well ,  trapped in the town ,  as sick of herself and the wasting asset of her body as I was sick of myself and my anxieties .  But the fit of jealousy in which he beats her would <head>appear</head> to mean something more than these words of explanation enable one to understand . This jealousy may be felt to be like Othello 's  in having more to do with difference of race ,  and with the jealousies of race ,  than  the jealous man ,  or than the work he belongs to ,  seems disposed to state .  Three of literature 's  myths underlie the narrative .

Here and elsewhere ,  the method ,  for all that Amis would hate to hear it ,  is dialectical .

He can <head>appear</head> in so doing to have his opinions and to eat them too . And he can also appear to place the novel in a state of suspension .

And it is a condition which can be recognised in the reception of his work .  There are readers whom ,  as Zuckerman is the first  ( or second )  to acknowledge ,  he can drive to the complaint that he has sex ,  and family matters ,  and Jewish matters ,  on the brain :  I want him to take his manuscript and mail it to his mother ,  as I have heard them cry .

In The Facts  he examines his own vexed state with reference to the vexed question of whether it is better to make things up ,  and to distort them ,  and by contemplating his earlier re - invention of the time - honoured dualistic account of literature and human nature .

It is important to note that in 191214 the protestant  loyalist group saw their right to violence as prior to that of the official state .  It is also important to note that they saw the taking of law into their own hands as temporary ,  and pending the recognition by that state of its mistaken attitude towards them and their right to a degree of autonomy .  It <head>appears</head> to be increasingly the case that there are two major traditions of identity perception among protestant loyalists . One tradition is the covenant one and is antagonistic to a straightforward nationalist sentiment .  It is adhered to by increasing numbers who have become disillusioned with British identity and have seen Paisley 's  words about the traitorous nature of British governments become reality as protestant  loyalist domination in Ulster has been continuously eroded .

The key event in the history of Ireland which appears to encapsulate Ulster protestant faith in God through Christ and the destiny of Ulster protestants as a people ,  is the war of 168991 .  William of Orange is seen to have worked the decisive victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 .  However , that myth is not quite the one which <head>appears</head> to have penetrated everyday life , perhaps because the place of the victory is located within the borders of the Southern state . The most powerful myth affecting everyday life narrates the less decisive defence of the city of Londonderry in 1689 .  The protestant refugees ,  inhabitants ,  and garrison of the city ,  which was built deliberately with a wall lest a catholic rebellion should ever occur ,  held the city for fifteen weeks against a poorly equipped catholic Irish army led by James II ,  the exiled king .

Later the hierarchy made it clear that the basis for their objections was the increase in power by the state vis -  - vis  the liberty and self - reliance of its citizens which such legislation would entail .  Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the whole affair is the way Dr Browne handled it .  The members of his party <head>appeared</head> to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the earlier Bill , and Dr Browne only found out in October/November 1950 . When he was told of the hierarchy 's  opposition to any bill of this kind ,  Dr Browne ,  himself secularly inclined ,  submitted his proposals and arguments to the hierarchy for approval ,  just as a previous Health Minister ,  Dr Walsh ,  had consulted Archbishop McQuaid on a similar matter in 1946 .

But where other churches have owned their own schools ,  as does the Church of Ireland in the South ,  a similar position has been adopted ,  though the reasons for the position have been on different grounds .  A proposal before the Church of Ireland synod in May 1979 to support interdenominational education was defeated ,  despite pressure from its ecumenical lobby .  The main grounds <head>appeared</head> to be the danger which it might pose to the small Southern protestant minority by encouraging mixed marriages . However ,  no evidence favouring such a contention has ever been produced .  Harry MacAdoo ,  then the Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin ,  on several occasions put forward the argument that Southern protestants were a minority group with their own culture and traditions ,  and thus deserved to have schools for themselves in order to hand on their own traditions .

A recent DSS Housing Benefit/Community Charge Benefit circular has given guidance about the treatment of income which is paid at intervals other than one week .  Where income such as an occupational pension or Retirement Pension is paid into a bank or building society account on ,  for example ,  a monthly or four - weekly basis ,  in some cases this has been treated as capital resulting in a possible reduction of benefit .  In effect it <head>appears</head> that the pension has been assessed both as income and capital . The circular states that income to cover a certain period should be ignored as capital for that period .  For example if a person who has 3,000 capital receives a monthly pension of 200 paid into their bank account ,  this should not be assessed as an increase in savings unless it remains unspent at the time the next payment is due .

This <head>appears</head> to make the concept of locally - available core services a rather uncertain one . As time goes on ,  the Government envisages more and more hospitals becoming NHS Trusts ,  with powers to negotiate what services they will provide .

But this was only innovative in so far as classical ballet was concerned as there are many 5/4 Slav folk dances .  Ashton makes brilliant use of this in his version of the solo ,  phrasing the steps so that a jump upwards can last three beats followed by two short steps or two beats followed by a long and then a short step .  Taking time in the air makes leaps <head>appear</head> higher and more sustained than is usual . Music should ,  however ,  not be used merely as a time - keeper as the above remarks may suggest .

That is ,  the choreographer must understand from which part of the body impetus is to be given so that the step achieves its full purpose at the proper moment  usually in some gesture and its musical emphasis .  The moment can be as the dancer pauses momentarily in a pose ,  as a comma in the middle or as a full stop at the end of a sentence .  Or the moment can be an important point in an overall design to fill space , such as the moment in a grand jet en avant when the dancer 's two legs are at an equal height from the ground and he or she <head>appears</head> to travel onwards effortlessly through space . It can also be the moment when a dancer moves into a pirouette  and spins before holding a pose .  However ,  more important is the third meaning of impetus which has also to do with physical performance .

Nor does it resemble the bravura footing of Kitri in the Don Quixote pas de deux or the passages in Ashton 's Ondine where his ballerina <head>appears</head> to be floating through water . Nor can it be compared with the ballerina 's  dance in Rhapsodie  where she wafts to and fro as if in a dream before breaking into her solo .  The spacing of such steps on pointe  is so minute and so fast that it is not possible to see the change of feet as one succeeds the other.

They ride ,  fence and parry with swords ,  and sing a song with a lute .  The gestures they make are at one with their interesting footwork .  The footwork <head>appears</head> again and again in different enchanements during their other appearances , notably in the short solo for Mercutio when he dances in a more tragic vein just before he dies .

3 In order to display particular native features ,  the traditional circle ,  chain and couple dance formations must be broken up and opened outwards so that the steps are seen clearly by the audience .  This is after all what the first balletmasters did when professionals <head>appeared</head> on stage and were no longer surrounded by the court where all eyes were focused on the king ( see page 76 ) . 4 The very particular relationship of the accenting and phrasing of the steps with the overall and short phrase rhythms and accents of the music must be maintained .

( See page 95 for other characteristics .  )  Polish The boy 's way of <head>appearing</head> to guide his girl just in front of him in all travelling steps affects the carrige of both himself and his partner . The constant use of what is called the feminine cadence is a particular rhythmic feature .  This is when a phrase finishes on the second  ( or weak )  and not on the first or third beat of a final bar .

This action is ,  of course ,  in direct contravention of the BMC 's  much vaunted policy on where and how bolts may be placed ,  which places an absolute ban on bolting on any gritstone crag .  While many of the bolts were placed prior to the issue of the BMC policy document ,  they still break the tradition against placing bolts or pegs on grit for any reason .  In this case it <head>appears</head> that the bolts have been placed , not for the purpose of protection , but to create an artificial gangway . Equally worrying to the BMC is that the centre negotiated its own private access agreement without consulting or even informing the council or its access officer Bill Wright .  The BMC 's  management committee ,  faced with what appears to be a fait accompli ,  must now decide what action ,  if any ,  can be taken .

And He shall say :  I receive them ,  O ye wise ones ,  I receive them ,  O ye men of learning ,  inasmuch as not one of these has deemed himself worthy .  And He will stretch forth His arms to us ,  and we shall fall down before Him ad weep ,  and we shall understand all things .  So the swine swine in God 's eyes too will <head>appear</head> on judgment Day immortal souls capable of penitence and knowledge . This tirade ,  carried on vodka - laden breath ,  is a classic instance of Dostoevsky 's  apocalyptic naturalism working on two levels at once .  Marmeladov projects the Christian Revelation on the church - slavonic plane of his and every Russian 's  Bible and liturgy ,  remoter from everyday usage than the English Authorized Version ;  and he indulges a maundering drunken account of himself .

The task is to follow lead car ,  which also appears on the screen ,  and travels at a varying rate .  The subject is told to keep the lead car at a constant ,  safe distance .  Alarm messages <head>appear</head> on the screen if the chase car gets too close to , or too far from , the lead car . System state is recorded three times a second ,  the data being preprocessed on the Archimedes before being passed to the college VAX cluster for statistical analysis .  Although drivers cannot steer the car in the current simulation ,  they do get a convincing impression of speed and distance ,  as well as  a scene recorded from real life .

Feminist criticism ,  like Marxist ,  is avowedly evaluative ,  which sharply distinguishes it from the generality of current academic criticism ,  of whatever school .  This is desirable in itself ,  though I do not warm to the feminist MacCarthyism which subjects texts to a close ,  hostile interrogation in a search for sexist attitudes .  I have attempted to take a rapid view of developments in critical theory , or criticism with a theoretical consciousness , as they have <head>appeared</head> in British culture in the past twenty years . There is an immediate contrast with the literary criticism and theory of the early twentieth century ,  in that most recent work begins and ends in the academy ,  and has little contact with current literary practice .  Both the New Criticism and Scrutiny  were products of the modernist literary revolution ,  and drew on it for their methods and their assumptions .
