Tear Fund Support Ugandan Work Anthony Kasozi 's  work as ACET 's  Director in uganda has recently received financial support form Tear Fund which has enabled him ,  together with ACET General Manager ,  Maurice Adams ,  to identify a number of church - based projects for the coming year .  These include : pedal cycles for a clinic allowing nurses to get out to outlying villages ; health care kits to help with the care of patients in their own homes ; training for <head>different</head> agencies ; and a variety of education initiatives . Returning from a visit to Uganda ,  where he met with patients in the villages and with other agencies ,  Maurice Adams said ,  It is a beautiful country which is being devastated by a disease which can be stopped .  The population in general is very well educated about AIDS ,  says Anthony Kasozi ,  thanks to the commitment of the Ugandan Government who have done well in raising awareness .

In April AI called on the Mauritanian Government to investigate reports that up to 200 political prisoners had died or been killed in military or police custody  some executed without trial and many others as a result of torture .  The victims were among some 3,000 black Mauritanians arrested late last year .  The authorities claimed they were conspiring to overthrow the government , which is dominated by a <head>different</head> community , the Moors , but offered no evidence to substantiate this claim . It took AI several months to compile details of the killings ,  but prisoners released in March 1991 provided information and themselves bore scars from torture .  In a few cases ,  prisoners are reported to have been deliberately executed without trial .

Do art historians write about the past ,  while art critics write about the present ?  Things are not so simple ,  as some art historians write well about the present ,  with a generosity of feeling and approach enriching to contemporary culture .  They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms , partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite <head>different</head> terms . Meyer Schapiro ,  who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,  was an open - minded historian of this sort .  He wrote enthusiastically about the later work of Arshile Gorky :  Gorky 's  atmosphere ,  veiling the hard opaque wall of the canvas ,  evokes a nocturnal void or the vague ,  unstable image - space of the day - dreaming mind .

German art historians had begun much more systematically on this task than others .  Several art historians wrote syntheses of art historical information ,  which became standard works .  Histories of art appeared in sequences of volumes by <head>different</head> authors , there were several series of books about artists and on museum collections , besides which the most comprehensive biographical dictionary of artists by Ulrich Thieme and Felix Becker started its long publication process in 1907 . Roger Fry acknowledged German scholarship as a precursor of serious art historical studies in this century .  Fry was a connoisseur of Renaissance art ,  but also he defended Post - Impressionism  ( a term he invented )  ,  was a painter ,  and published a monograph on Czanne .

Bridget Riley came to prominence as an artist in the 1960s ,  when her dazzling patterned paintings were a clear success in British Op Art .  Her National Gallery choices of pictures were examples of problems posed to artists by colour ,  and in a video talk she demonstrated how these artistic problems had been solved .  Connections with her own practice as a painter were evident , even though her abstract compositions were very <head>different</head> in subject from the works of her chosen artists , who included Veronese and Poussin . Her argument was that the subjects of the old master paintings could be disregarded by a painter who wished to find lessons for the present in the artistic practice of the past .  Bridget Riley had no intention of either presenting an account of Poussin 's  aims and procedures ,  or of demonstrating Veronese 's  debts to his predecessors in Venetian art ,  as a historian would have felt a duty to do .

Nor will a history of art criticism be attempted .  The stress of the book falls on a viewer 's  encounter with a work of art ,  and how a prior reading of a piece of art criticism can improve that encounter .  To put the matter in a slightly <head>different</head> way , reading art criticism is a preparation for an aesthetic event . James S. Ackerman ,  the architectural scholar ,  makes use of this phrase in writing about art and communication :  What a work of art communicates can be described only in terms of an interaction between  an object and a subject ;  it communicates nothing at all unless someone is there to look at it .  In other words ,  there are no aesthetic objects ,  only physical objects ,  which ,  when observed ,  are capable of stimulating an aesthetic event .

Unlike old - fashioned narrative history ,  art has no decisive battles ,  no international treaties ,  and no changes of government .  This is perhaps a more useful analogy than might at first sight appear .  Newer approaches to history can give accounts which do not have landmark events and which tell us about <head>different</head> aspects of the past , such as social conditions . Deciding where is the beginning can be a trouble for an art historian .  In Europe ,  classical times are a beginning for historians ,  but not for archaeologists .

It is perhaps more the stuff of epigrams than analysis .  The idea that there is such a thing as the spirit of a time can be awkwardly challenged by asking ,  Whose time ?  No prizes can be offered for pointing out that at a given moment there are artists of several generations working and in very <head>different</head> ways . A further ,  and rather extreme way of dealing with a chronological survey of art is to eliminate the artists .  Art history without names was a phrase used by Heinrich Wlflinn ,  in his introduction to The Principles of Art History  first published in 1915 .

There are many choices of arrangement and treatment available to a monographer .  An art historian may choose to elucidate the social context of the art ,  or trace its sources in the work of other artists ;  these choices will be reflected in the illustrations as well as the text ,  while sketches ,  other versions of pictures and related material will be available for the reader to make comparisons .  Roger Fry , in writing about Czanne , took a <head>different</head> route . A painter himself ,  he was attracted to the problems he believed that Czanne had faced and solved in composition and technique .  Fry 's  opening words are :  Those artists among us whose formation took place before the war recognise Czanne as their tribal deity ,  and their totem .

The authors are Rudolph and Margot Wittkower ,  and their theme is that while some artists succeed in financial and social circumstances without strain ,  other artists tend to Saturnine temperaments .  Saturn is the planet of melancholics ,  and Renaissance philosophers discovered that the emancipated artists of their time should have the characteristics of the Saturnine temperament ;  they were contemplative ,  meditating ,  brooding ,  solitary ,  creative .  Comparable ideas about artists can be discovered in other cultures , but also very <head>different</head> views . Even in Europe ,  Saturn is not the only planet under whose influence it is possible to be born .  Mercury is the patron of cheerful ,  lively men of action .

Occasionally the challenge is too daunting ,  and teams of writers combine forces rather than one author attempting to rival the knowledge and skills of a Leonardo .

Sometimes subjects require considerable explanation or interpretation ,  and in these cases the museum catalogue can give definitive help .  Interpretation of iconography ,  the historical context of works ,  or personal information about sitters for portraits are only a few of the varied topics which can be spelt out in catalogues .  The level of detail may seem much the same as in a catalogue raisonn , but the stress falls in a <head>different</head> way . In  a catalogue raisonn an individual work is related primarily to other works by the artist ,  while a museum catalogue entry will extend to other contextual information and comparisons .  Some of the work for a museum catalogue may have already been done before the acquisition of a picture .

In a few hours I felt reborn and replete with new powers ,  washed clean and cured of a long sickness ,  finally ready to enter life with joy and vigour ;  equally cured was suddenly the world around me ,  and  exorcised the name and face of the woman who had gone down into the lower depths with me and had not returned .

No drama school panel is looking for the ultimate in audition technique but candidates  should possess a noticeable degree of competence and self - awareness .  Not all auditions have just two speeches ,  classical and modern .

In some schools you will be asked to participate with other students in basic class work over a weekend  ( as happens at the Bristol Old Vic drama school )  and in some you may find yourself being judged partly by senior students of the school who will be sitting with the faculty panel  ( which is something that happens at Drama Centre )  .  The point of preparation is to be well tuned and at the same time flexible to new interpretations and ideas .

But predicates are essentially general .  Consider the sentence John is tall .

If this were not so ,  and all statements simply joined names that referred to individuals ,  nothing would be said about  those individuals .

The argument transposes ,  however .  Since merely knowing the brain state does not reveal what the experience is like ,  and since what the experience is like  ,  if it is a reality at all  ( which Tye does not dispute )  ,  must be a fact about the experience  ( or a feature or aspect of the experience ,  which will do just as well )  ,  it follows that the experience is not a brain state .  There is one well - known materialist account of <head>different</head> modes of knowledge that might seem to be useful here in preserving the mode of knowledge approach against the need for the more drastic behaviouristic alternative . Physicalists of the 1950s and 1960s were worried by the following problem .  Experiences ,  they argued ,  are identical with brain states ;  but when someone is conscious of his experiences he is not conscious of his brain as such :  it takes modern science to tell us that consciousness is a state of the brain .

There would be no distinction between the thinker and the reality he was thinking about .

In this case , the reality of ( say ) of an orange being behind the breadboard is <head>different</head> from the appearance which is that of a breadboard leaning against the kitchen wall . And what of the unseen portions of the wall behind the board ?  The appearance is of the wall stopping just as it reaches the board ;  but do not the input systems deliver up the information that the wall continues behind the occluder ?

This is ,  I would argue ,  a powerful idea which makes the phenomena of mental development more intelligible to us .  What I shall do now is try to back up this last statement by sketching some of the characteristics of childish thought ,  showing how they can be explained in constructivist terms .  They all concern , in <head>different</head> ways , the appearance - reality distinction , because cognisance must be understood in terms of our drawing this distinction in every area of our mental life . An infant at eight months who retrieves a completely - occluded object has made a major advance in understanding the appearance - reality distinction ,  at least on the plane of action ,  because he now knows that ,  although the perceptual input at one time tells him that there is no rattle in his reachable space ,  really there is .  This also means that the infant can now understand a kind of ambiguity :  the rattle is both absent and present at the same time .

The neutral question is interpreted phenomenally ,  where an older child  ( around seven years )  interprets it in a realist fashion .  Maybe the reader 's  first thought an experiment of my own showed that this is not misinterpretation in any simple sense .  We tested children in pairs so that each child in the pair observed visual illusions from <head>different</head> angles such that one child saw one kind of illusory view and the partner saw an opposite but equally conflicting view . For example both children knew that bricks A and B were the same size ,  but ,  when viewed through portholes in a box ,  A looked bigger to one child and B looked bigger to the partner .  They were free to look over the top of the box to see what size the bricks really were ,  and they were quite aware that their own view was distorted because one of the portholes contained a magnifying lens .

It began to seem a possibility that an external observer would be able to predict whether or not an apparently relaxed subject was forming visual images .  Another exciting window on the mind seemed to open up in Chicago in the 1950s when Nathaniel Kleitman and Bill Dement  began using the techniques of electroencephalography to investigate sleep .  Sleep could be divided into a number of <head>different</head> phases which recurred at regular intervals throughout the night . One of these phases was known as paradoxical or rapid eye - movement  ( REM )  sleep .  It was paradoxical because although the subject was very deeply asleep ,  being completely relaxed and more difficult to wake than at any other time during the night ,  the EEG pattern was that of alert wakefulness .

So again ,  laboratory techniques were affording scientists a glimpse of their subjects '  mental lives .  The brain is not only an electrical machine ,  it also has a physical and chemical structure and these too are now being monitored in the living brain .  By using computers to integrate the information from a large number of <head>different</head> viewpoints round the skull , it is possible to visualize the appearance of a slice through the brain and build up a full three - dimensional image . The viewing medium can be X - rays ,  as in computerized tomographic  ( CT )  scans ;  magnetic resonance of atomic nuclei ,  as in nuclear magnetic resonance  ( NMR )  scans ;  or emission from radioactively labelled substances incorporated into the structure of nerve cells as in positron emission tomographic  ( PET )  scans .  These obviously have considerable clinical value for localizing and identifying areas of brain abnormality ,  but they also enable areas of activity in the normally functioning brain to be pictured .

All these EEG and scanning techniques are ,  so far ,  giving us only very rough correlations between brain structure and function and mental processes .  More important ,  the mental processes being studied are still only crudely defined .  A <head>different</head> and apparently much more specific line of research , however , developed from another of Adrian 's electrophysiological experiments . While studying the relationship between visual stimuli and the EEG ,  Adrian found  that if a regular series of bright flashes was presented to the subject 's  eyes there was an equally regular series of blips in the EEG recorded from electrodes on the scalp over the visual areas at the back of the skull .  These little potential shifts ,  known as either evoked potentials  ( EPs )  or event related potentials  ( ERPs )  ,  are normally buried in the random background activity of the EEG .

It is these internally generated or endogenous components ,  lasting sometimes as long as a second after the triggering stimulus ,  which offer the most potential for investigating mental activities .  ERPs are very slippery customers .  Even those who most strongly advocate their use as research tools would admit that we do not know exactly what neural processes generate them and that any particular fluctuation will be the result of a multiplicity of <head>different</head> kinds of changes occurring in several <head>different</head> and possibly independent systems . Some of these changes will be related to neural processes that have little psychological relevance .  Nor is there any reason to suppose that the peaks and valleys of the fluctuations have greater neural or psychological significance than any other intermediate point .

So this damping down of the sensory input when attention moves elsewhere can occur very early in the pathway from the sense organ to the brain .  These early experiments were sometimes difficult to interpret ,  but the general finding that the form of the ERP is affected by shifts in attention has proved very reliable .  Recent experiments on the psychophysiology of selective attention by , for example , Steven Hillyard at San Diego and Emanuel Donchin at Illinois have successfully related <head>different</head> endogenous components in the ERP to <head>different</head> stages in the process of selective attention . Suppose a subject is listening to different sequences of sounds played independently to each ear through a pair of headphones in order to pick out and respond to a particular target sound .  If the subject is instructed to attend to one ear and ignore the sounds coming into  the other ear ,  all the sounds in the attended ear will produce an enhanced N100 component in the ERP .

As Bauer put it in a recent BBC television discussion of covert recognition ,  Our normal experience of perception ,  of seeing objects or faces as an all or none process ,  is a trick that the brain plays on us .  It is a trick that should no longer fool anyone except phenomenologists .  Finally , as in the discussion of reading , I could point to other patients who have a wide variety of <head>different</head> face processing problems . For example ,  some have difficulties in retrieving semantic information about people  ( for example their occupation )  ,  some have difficulties specific to the retrieval of people 's  names ,  and some can remember old faces but cannot learn new ones .  The problems which these and other patients suffer can mostly be explained in terms of detailed functional models of face processing such as that proposed by Bruce and Young  ( 1986 )  ,  in the same way that patients '  different reading problems could be explained by Coltheart  ( 1985 )  .

Colour refers to the actual wavelengths of the light rays concerned and determines the hue  ( redness ,  blueness ,  etc )  ,  which can be bright or dull ,  muted or full .  Most timber colours are of somewhat muted hues and generally very subtle  ( though not often dull )  ,  but can vary enormously from one another in tone value .  Much of the judgement used in choosing your veneers is instinctive , based on comparing <head>different</head> samples ; it comes from familiarity with woods and an innate colour sense . I suggest two points to bear in mind .  The first is to try to achieve a combination in which the tones of the different parts of the design are sufficiently distinct to read clearly one from another but do not display too violent tonal contrasts ,  unless a particularly dramatic effect is part of your aim !

The demand for elegance carries with it the requirement to fit in with existing furniture and although talking points can be useful ,  a table surrounded by a set of such chairs could be a positive eyesore .
