The scope or character of a piece of criticism is naturally related to the magazine or newspaper in which it appears ,  as we noticed in the case of Dore Ashton 's  dismissal from the New York Times  because it was asserted that her work could not be understood by the paper 's  readers .  The first rule for a reader of articles is thus to find a sympathetic publication .  Some trial and error should eliminate the laziest <head>papers</head> , whose critics do no more than pillage catalogue introductions , or even press releases . Some latitude can be allowed to serious critics who write for periodicals which go to press a long time before a show is on view ;  these critics will not be able to comment on how the exhibition actually looks ,  as their articles will have been written before the show 's  installation .  They  nevertheless will have seen some ,  perhaps all the works included ,  and can thus comment usefully on the artist 's  standing ,  aims and achievements .

According to the Guardian  ,  the New Year 's  Honours list of 1988 in Britain contained a knighthood for Professor Albert Maillard ,  the Oxford historian .  Two of the several names owned by another recipient had strayed into someone 's  word - processor to create a further deserving don ,  the knowing reference to whom must have ruined the new year for more than one senior scholar .  I feel that Albert Maillard , if he existed , would have no time for Kapuscinski 's impressionism , for his absence of dates , figures and state <head>papers</head> , and that Albert Maillard would be wrong . There is history in the  accounts Kapuscinski gives of the confusions and uncertainties which he has experienced and which he has tried to interpret .  All is not dark in these accounts ,  and indeed they can be said to gleam with a quality of reflected light .

Inspectors can no longer hide behind a <head>paper</head> managing a desk ( quote from a Chief Superintendent ) . Then again for reasons of established cultural preference we had to go back to the Audit Commission and ask them to translate 6.358 million into real men ,  for we had difficulty in trying to sell such an alien concept to the police mind .  In effect their fiscal mandate meant their version of reality failed to synchronize with the police world view .

Certainly the social sciences are seen to be the arbiters of revolutionary change which might somehow dismantle the police institution and its processes ,  and this has led it to negate the reforming social scientists ,  keeping them as outsiders beyond the system .  A further example from the Police Foundation Oxford Conference gives some indication of the different perspectives which exist for the analytic researcher and the practical policeman :  Barrie Irving , the Police Foundation director has presented a <head>paper</head> today outlining research into the Police and Criminal Evidence Act ( PACE ) . Having some 1979 data on custody practices and prisoner interviews he sought to replicate the study in 1986/7 to assess the influence of the legislation on police practice .  Claiming significant differences in post - PACE activities he suggested these showed the need for legal measures to impact upon police practice and influence change .

Although rarely defined ,  it is often on the lips of the members ,  so that the phrase ,  I do n't want to seem disloyal ,  but will often preface even the mildest internal criticism of any of the systems of policing .  This total reverence to the group binds ideas of silence ,  loyalty ,  and reticence together to create a positive category for belief and action and ,  in turn ,  links silence to other concepts of respect for the order of the institution .  In consequence , even the publication of an academic seminar <head>paper</head> carried out without formal approval could form a breach in the regulated structures of police existence and be subject to disciplinary control . In such a world ,  the easy resolution of the ethical dilemma remains problematic ,  for as Anne Akeroyd  ( 1984 :  134 )  recognizes there is not ,  nor ever likely to be any definitive agreement about the nature of either the problems or solutions facing the social scientist and the question of ethics .  I have never completely resolved my own dilemma ,  for I do not think it has a simple resolution .

Any criteria for defining privileged information ,  or what the dangers are in revealing such matters as dispositions  ( of manpower )  are so vaguely incorporated as to  ensure that few will risk submitting an essay without approval ,  which might later be assessed as an improper disclosure .  The creation of this order at the time a new Official Secrets Bill was being pushed through Parliament by an increasingly interventionist government is significant ,  and the idea of a senior officer 's  having first read of any essay to maintain the integrity of the institution manifests the importance of the legalized surveillance of allegedly dangerous material and enhances the separation of the world of control from that academic enquiry ;  although its implementation is only randomly applied .

The Staff College should be a place where serving officers have the opportunity to contemplate society as a whole and in particular to study and consider those liberal and humane values which are central to our society .  The college should have as its prime concern the nurture of ethics and integrity ;  they are the core of any professions .  Such a proposal is now of another era , however , and I was present when an ex - Dean of Academic Studies at the college presented a <head>paper</head> ( Stead 1980 ) attacking the trend to expensive , amalgamated police units which had grown up in the previous two decades . The appetite for power these immense forces display worried Stead ,  and he argued their style could only lead to an autocratic national system with a minister of central government at the apex .  His fears seem to be well founded ,  for a move towards regionalization is now occurring ,  with a proposal that the forty - three forces disappear into perhaps eight or nine giant regional units .

And even if an uncommissioned but critical ethnography is not considered to be in breach of the Official Secrets Act ,  it will most likely be construed as structural espionage and lie in breach of the Police Discipline Code as set out in Police Regulations .  Any internal disciplinary measure to contain such an account is much less likely to become of public concern in the way that the Clive Ponting or the Cathy Massiter prosecutions became notorious causes clbres  .  As a result of this all pervading desire for reticence it is possible to suggest that the presentation of research <head>papers</head> in seminars , the creation of an undirected thesis , not to mention the production of a book , could easily have placed me in breach of Regulation 6 , which outlines the disciplinary offence of Improper disclosure of information ,  which offence is committed where a member of a police force  ( a )  without proper authority communicates to any person ,  any information which he has in his possession as a member of a police force That I avoided such a course of action is because of my own understanding of what the institution would allow before it swung into action .

Our lists contained the names of the family prigs we knew were professional thieves and burglars ;  and of whom I was advised on my arrival in the department by an old detective :  you only get one chance a year to nail these bastards if you are lucky ,  so when you do ,  its got to be watertight .  Again the litism in the department is largely symbolic ,  for although  detectives talk continuously of their special knowledge of the world of prigs ,  and despise the uniform branch as wollies ,  often it is the uniform polis who responds to a call and effects the capture ,  after which the detective moves in to squeeze him dry .  The detective has therefore moved away from the centrally important activity of seizing the villains into a manipulated world where the <head>paper</head> exercise of statistical detections is used to assuage politicians , the media , and a public obsessed with the moral panic of increasing crime rates . Furthermore ,  the detectives are no longer in that basic symbol of police identity  the uniform .  They are less constrained and have more individuality in their civvy clothes ,  although there are strict ,  but unwritten rules about what is acceptable dress  ( sombre suits and ties )  and what is disordered and undisciplined  ( jeans ,  T - shirts ,  training shoes ,  and the like )  .

Ours was now a multiple reality and our structural ambivalence can be illustrated by one example when one of the squad created a blazer badge in heraldic style  ( although we could never have been seen in a blazer at this time when faded denim was the order of the day )  .  This badge had crossed hypodermic syringes and a Latin motto which when translated ,  read :  Bodies in the cells ,  names in the papers .  The blazer badge reinforced the capture of bodies philosophy which had sustained our earlier lives , but was created at the same time that I was compiling a <head>paper</head> for presentation at the national BMA police surgeons ' conference .

The blazer badge reinforced the capture of bodies philosophy which had sustained our earlier lives ,  but was created at the same time that I was compiling a paper for presentation at the national BMA police surgeons '  conference .  I believe they came to hear jolly conference stories about drug fiends and acid heads , but the <head>paper</head> concluded : it would seem that the economics of the socially approved tobacco and alcohol industries means that we have to accept 42,000 deaths annually from cigarettes ,  and the cost to society of 50,000 alcoholics .  These drug casualties are the price of minimal control and an accepted licence to use some drugs .

James bowed ironically and offered them the document ;  Alexander Menzies pretended to think about it for a full five minutes and signed it with  extraordinary flourishes that made the pen splutter and seemed to say ,  Very well ,  I will humour your ridiculous ritual .

The young man scanned the <head>paper</head> , held it out , and as James 's fingers reached for it , dropped it , eyed him , and said in a carrying voice , I see you are mad , but does even a lunatic suppose that one of His Majesty 's officers would bind himself to oppose the law and refrain from arresting criminals ? They went for him then ,  Alexander and Donald McLaggan ,  the Duke 's  two sons ,  dragged him from his father 's  side so that his head bounced on the steps ,  lifted him bleeding ,  like foresters keeping a dying deer clear of the hounds ,  and started to carry him down to the river just to cool him off but Cameron ran and gripped Donald 's  shoulder and shouted ,  If you injure an officer it is treason on top of sedition ,  so they carried him back and laid him carefully at his father 's  feet .

The review  focusses  on management structures ,  budgets and monitoring their use ,  securing value for money ,  and directing money to those hospitals which treat most patients .  The working papers develop some of the organisational and management implications of proposals in the Review .  Age Concern has prepared a Briefing <head>Paper</head> which summarises the White - <head>Paper</head> and the working papers , and which is available from the Information and Policy Department . This discussion paper considers points made in the Review and in the working papers .  It is difficult to relate the proposals in the review to prospects for services for elderly people ,  as although it is entitled Working for Patients ,  the Review makes little mention of health care for individuals or particular client groups .

The instructions supplied with the tool recommend pre - bending the <head>paper</head> to help in fitting it tightly , but we found this unnecessary . The machine can be used without the dust frame cover which simply snaps on to the decking ,  but in this case you will lose the benefits of dust extraction ;  to this end ,  a dust bag is supplied and this very simply pushes into a part of the side of the machine .  There is a small spring catch to hold the dust bag in place and at the correct alignment .

A Title :   PAPER PEOPLE ,  which survives as a phrase in Shatov 's  mouth ,  tossed up twice by the polemical flood .

He belongs to a <head>paper</head> society which goes through the motions of life , in the air , notionally . Many a reader of The Possessed  will have smiled at Von Lemke 's  paper cut - outs  the conductor waving his baton ,  the bustling railway porter ,  the hell - fire gesticulating preacher  and at the same time he will have wondered why the microcosmic animated toys feel so supremely right for this novel .

Peter tried to rouse his countrymen from their aboriginal stupor and turn them into Europeans ;  but a Russian is n't and ca n't be a German or a Frenchman ,  and the result of Peter 's  efforts was to produce an educated class who ca n't be Russians either .  They can of course call themselves Slavophils ,  but that is to try and wish away Peter ,  to perform an act of mental regression ,  not to be a Russian .  It is a <head>paper</head> act in a <head>paper</head> situation , inflammable and precarious . The dangerous consequences of Peter are much canvassed in the notebooks :  the social unsteadiness  (  shatost  )  ,  as Shatov says .  Thus the cappy man has become the shaky man ,  the waverer .

But he has published nothing ,  refuses third parties access to his collection and will not catalogue what he has .

A printed DXF file is quickly recognisable by consisting mainly of a narrow strip of short lines down the left hand margin of each page ,  usually a large number of pages ,  and a great deal of white paper .  It needs to be remembered that the format is not primarily designed for printing on paper ;  this is just a handy feature .

This too would retain its pre - eminent position as an insulator until replaced around 1933 by Polyethylene developed by ICI .  Thomson 's  siphon recorder An operation , a moving coil D'Arsonval galvanometer connected to the line was arranged so that coil deflections , brought about by an incoming signal , controlled movement of a writing head across a moving <head>paper</head> tape . The tape was driven by either an electric or clockwork motor and the writing head was supplied with ink from a reservoir by siphon action ,  as the tape was being driven .  Writing head deflections were proportional to the received signal current ,  and so the graph produced indicated magnitude of the line current .

There is the further consideration that universities may not indefinitely be secure havens for literary criticism ,  in the cold economic climate and rampant anti - intellectualism of Thatcherite Britain ,  and of many other parts of the world .   When English was established in British universities criticism played at best a minor part in it .  There was a critical <head>paper</head> in the Oxford degree , but the emphasis was substantially on scholarship of a tough traditional kind , without much concession to the Arnoldian free play of mind . For a long time Oxford English was directed towards scholarship and was suspicious of criticism ,  and this attitude was reflected in its house organ ,  The Review of English Studies  .  Helen Gardner ,  for many years an Oxford luminary ,  did not believe that the purpose of English was to turn out critics ,  any more than it was to produce poets and novelists .

It is here that research <head>papers</head> are generated and read and discussed , and where the academic superstars go through their paces and inspire their dedicated students . As early as 1921 ,  the Newbolt Report ,  summarizing the evidence of  Professor Ernest de Slincourt ,  expressed deep unease about the American approach to literary research :  Many of the elaborate theses on English Literature produced by American students for their Doctorate ,  and afterwards published ,  were monuments of misdirected effort ;  in short ,  a true sense of literature as a living thing was lost ,  and in its place was substituted an investigation after the worse pattern of German research ,  deadening alike to those who wrote and those who read it .

The task of the academic is to teach and engage in research ,  and ,  if required ,  to take on administrative duties .  Although there is parity of esteem among academic subjects ,  and dog is careful not to eat dog ,  at least in public ,  a scientific model of knowledge has ,  I believe ,  come to dominate the modern academy ,  and to affect attitudes to and within humanistic learning .  Such knowledge is progressive , rendering earlier versions of itself obsolete , and it circulates quickly and visibly through the accepted professional channels , like journals and conference - <head>papers</head> . It is also subject to quantifiable assessment ,  in terms of volume of publication ,  frequency of citation ,  amounts of research funding ,  and the calibre of referees .

AN INCOMING Labour government would turn large areas of Whitehall upside down  but the party 's  policy review barely considers the implications of its plans for restructuring government departments .  Scattered through the policy review are proposals to :  Drastically alter the status and organisation of the Department of Trade and Industry ;  Create two departments  a Department of Consumer Affairs ,  and a Department for Legal Administration ;  Create a Department of Environmental Protection within the existing Department of the Environment ;  Set up a plethora of new commissions and executive agencies ;  Set up a Women 's  Ministry .  Those are only the most overt changes advocated in the review <head>papers</head> . The only department which explicitly escapes unscathed is the one which Conservatives would most like to abolish :  the Department of Energy .  In virtually every case the aim of causing upheaval is explicitly declared ,  because Labour 's  aim would be to upset the bureaucratic order it inherits .

He did not actually handle or take possession of any documents , and is unable to substantiate the detail or authenticity of <head>papers</head> of which he had some sight . The existence of Inner Circle was immediately questioned by loyalists .  Nonetheless ,  the fact that there have been up to a score of document leaks in the past month means the report is being given widespread credence .

King lost a leg during war service in Italy ,  an event which makes his thorough surveys of castles ,  notably those in Wales ,  even more remarkable .  He made teaching his career and taught history and mathematics in preparatory schools in Somerset .  His spare time was devoted to the study of the castle , in which he was ably assisted by Clifford Perks , his former collaborator on several <head>papers</head> , and later by Mark Cheshire , a former pupil . In the 1950s and 1960s the royal castles were examined in detail by various authorities ,  but it was the great baronial buildings in Wales that attracted King .  From the 1950s through to the early 1980s he published an important series of papers ,  the majority in the Cambrian Archaeological Association 's  Archaeologia Cambrensis ,  notably on the Pembrokeshire castles of Carew ,  Manorbier and Pembroke ,  and the native Welsh castles of Dinas Bran and Caergwrle in the north of the principality .

At the same time as he was working on individual buildings ,  King produced his lists of all the castles in Wales and the Marches ,  as well as more detailed papers on the counties of Breconshire and Cardiganshire .  His fieldwork in England and Wales led him to visit virtually every castle with visible remains ,  from humble earthwork upwards ,  culminating in the publication of his Castellarium Anglicanum  ( 1983 )  .

This two - volume work details all the castles built in England and Wales ,  and reference will always be made to it as long as castles are studied .  However ,  it is King 's  work in Wales that is his great legacy .  He was a frequent attender of the Chateau Gaillard European Castle Studies conferences , and contributed several <head>papers</head> to the published proceedings . He always had a deep interest in siege engines and the construction of scale working models of these machines ;  one of the memorable events of the Chateau Gaillard conference at Durham University was witnessing David 's  experiments with his machines on the campus lawns ,  using marbles for ammunition .  In 1962 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and later ,  from 1976 to 1977 ,  he served as President of the Cambrian Archaelogical Association .

That view is presented in a classical French ,  rarely illustrated ,  and then only with the smallest photographs or the occasional line drawing .  It follows an editorial policy that believes foreign news should lead the first three pages ,  that matters of national interest should be philosophically debated in the newspaper 's  columns ,  and that half a page of sport either side of the weekend is enough .

Le Monde ,  one of the country 's  most profitable publishing concerns producing special supplements and books while printing other publications ,  has invested a sum conservatively estimated at not less than Fr350m in a state - of - the - art printing press .  The press ,  at Ivry ,  a suburb south - east of Paris ,  is the most technologically advanced in Europe and will enable Le Monde to print in colour and to produce 64 - page newspaper ,  a third as much again .  With so many pages , the decision to divide the <head>paper</head> into separate sections : home and foreign news , society and culture , economics and business news with special supplements , books and ideas on Friday , arts and listings on Thursday and a radio/television guide at the weekend , has been dictated by the problems of readability as much as anything else . The paper was just getting too unwieldly ,  we needed to give our readers some help in finding their way around the paper ,  says Mr Fontaine .  He also hopes the new format will attract new readers ,  both those who do not regularly read a daily newspaper and converts from the rival Liberation  -  which has won an extraordinary success among younger readers with its mix of lively writing ,  news features and bold use of photography and design .

But there are two other ,  less obvious laws as well .  Prints ,  to be valuable ,  must be good impressions on good quality paper .  Edvard Munch , whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print - makers of the century , fails to qualify as blue - chip , despite occasional high prices at auction , because he often used poor quality <head>paper</head> and the impressions are not always of the best quality . The final qualification is that a print - maker ,  to reach the very top of the tree ,  must be known and appreciated by the Japanese .

The Berkeley Square Gallery ,  for example ,  maintains a second outlet in Tokyo ,  as a vital part of its operations .

They do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on <head>paper</head> which seems so obvious indeed axiomatic to Europeans . They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists  Hokusai ,  for instance ,  and Hiroshige  made print - making a primary creating medium .  Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image  to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing .

The scuffling over Patrick 's  soul may soon move to a more prosaic level ,  that of his modest estate and ,  in particular ,  the Irish copyright to his writings .  Dr Kavanagh ,  Patrick 's  Sacred Keeper ,  has already published The Complete Poems ,  first in America and then ,  in 1984 ,  in Ireland through the Goldsmith Press ,  whose proprietor is the Kildare poet Desmond Egan .  Dr Kavanagh sold his brother 's <head>papers</head> , including letters from Katherine to Patrick , to University College , Dublin , three years ago for 100,000 . Royalties remain a dynamic issue in the wake of the great funeral fiasco .  In July ,  a few weeks before she died ,  Katherine started High Court proceedings against Mr Egan and his publishing house for breach of copyright .

Sir :  In his report on the seminar on the Rushdie affair organised jointly by the Commission for Racial Equality and the Policy Studies Institute  ( 3 October )  ,  John Torode says that the proceedings were dominated by pragmatist liberals  those who believe in restricting freedom of speech in order to protect the religious sensibilities of fundamentalists .  But there was no such domination .  Two of the five <head>papers</head> presented at the seminar disapproved of such censorship . The participants represented a wide variety of views and tended on the whole to disapprove of state - imposed censorship .  Mr Torode says he was told that those supporting the Government 's  views on blasphemy were excluded .

Hostels Researchers at The Policy Studies Institute were commissioned by the then Department of Health and Social Security to study the extent to which hostels for the needy provided care as well as accommodation and food ,  to enable the department to decide if ,  how ,  and by whom they should be funded .  Its report published in July last year ,  The Cost of Care in Hostels ,  concluded :  Even hostels offering relatively low care were still offering some care ,  and had to spend more than could be explained simply in terms of the costs of accommodation .  On the same day the DHSS published a consultation <head>paper</head> proposing changes which would deprive many of income . The report called Help with Hostel Charges ,  Proposals for Change cited the PSI study and stated :  Many hostels provided little or no care to their residents .  Where care is provided ,  it is far more often in the form of advice than of assistance with physical care.

The British Market Research Bureau had examined how the sexual habits of homosexuals had changed between 1986 and 1989 .  Its paper was to be presented to a Market Research Society seminar last March when ,  with three days '  notice ,  the health department instructed the authors to withdraw it .  It was cut out of conference papers and replaced with a notice slipped into the file saying : The proposed <head>paper</head> on the Aids monitor has unfortunately had to be withdrawn , since it has not been possible to synchronise the publication with the Health Education Authority 's own report on the 1988 data , expected in the near future . The paper has still not been published .  Fears that the Government was putting constraints on research it commissions were fuelled when ,  last year ,  the then DHSS inserted a new clause in its contract with outside researchers .

And at the moment you are reading a typeface called Dutch ,  a sharper version of Times New Roman .

Apart from a page 9 reference to hooligans in Neues Deutschland ,  only the youth paper ,  Junge Welt ,  referred to the unprecedented protests over the weekend ,  which saw tens of thousands of young East Germans on the streets ,  and an estimated 1,000 still in jail in East Berlin alone .  Junge Welt printed a photograph of some demonstrators .  The most high - level discontent appeared in an extraordinary open letter to the same <head>paper</head> , the organ of the Free German Youth ( SDJ ) . The president of the Writer 's  Association ,  Hermann Kant ,  a central committee member ,  said the exodus of almost 50,000 refugees could not be blamed on the wicked class enemy in West Germany :  A defeat is a defeat even if it comes on the eve of a glorious celebration .  He attacked the smug self glorification of the official press ,  the pervasive bossiness of the system ,  and said that social understanding was imperative through criticism and self - criticism  openly ,  not bleating ,  but by being hard and patient .

The UK was not alone in thinking that the original proposal was too rigid and paid insufficient regard to market forces .

Last week , she outraged her Commission colleagues by suggesting that the government 's <head>paper</head> , which has unanimous backing , might prove irresistible . It may not be long before her view is upheld .  Any decision on taxation has to be taken by the member states unanimously and there now seems little hope that the Commission can deflect them from the course they set out upon yesterday .

Ministers will decide in January exactly how council performance should be measured and they want assessments to begin in April .  A consultation <head>paper</head> published yesterday suggested the proportion of rent collected , the amount of rent arrears , the number of empty properties and the average cost and waiting time for repairs must be included . The minister also said a framework for securing the future of shared ownership schemes in rural areas ,  offering part - rent ,  part - purchase deals ,  had been agreed with the Housing Corporation .  During the housing debate ,  Kevin Johnston ,  from Eastbourne ,  East Sussex ,  was cheered as he said :  The homelessness problem is even more acute now than in 1985 .

Later Eichmann ,  faced with a lack of rail transport ,  began a programme of deportations by foot  death marches along a 120 - mile route from Budapest to the Austrian border at Hegyeshalom .  Ignoring attempts on his life ,  and constant threats ,  Wallenberg used every means possible to outwit the executioners ,  bribing Hungarian and German officials ,  threatening the Gestapo and issuing Swedish passports which ,  surprisingly ,  offered some protection in a period hardly renowned for respect for the law. He began by giving official passports to Jews who could claim some vague connection with Sweden , and ended by thrusting , in defiance of the Gestapo , cyclostyled <head>papers</head> bearing his signature into the hands of anyone he could reach , in the cattle trucks in railway sidings or along the road as the tragic columns struggled by . Gideon Hausner ,  the Israeli lawyer who prosecuted Eichmann in 1961 ,  estimates that Wallenberg personally saved 30,000 Jews in Budapest .  Others claim that some 100,000 owe their lives to his efforts .

The White Paper on changes to the Scottish legal profession published yesterday by Malcolm Rifkind ,  the Secretary of State for Scotland ,  says that once trained ,  Scottish solicitors should have unrestricted rights of audience in the higher courts ,  with the standard of performance achieved in training as the sole test .  Any rule directly or indirectly restricting solicitors '  freedom to undertake all the actions necessary for the preparation and presentation of cases will need the approval of both the Secretary of State and the Lord President of the Court of Session .  But in what the Law Society also interpreted yesterday as a clear shift in emphasis from the English proposals , the <head>paper</head> makes it clear that the role of the Lord President would be no different from the one he currently exercises when approving training and professional rules . Under the English White Paper ,  rights of audience rules drawn up by the Law Society in conjunction with an advisory committee will be subject to the concurrence of four senior judges .  The society fears that the Bar and judges will exert subtle pressure to build in case separation requirements .

Both BBC viewers and those who did not watch the BBC were agreed on balance that it was biased towards the Conservatives though those who actually watched it were more evenly divided on the direction of BBC bias than those who did not  ( Table 6.1 again )  .  ( For corroborative figures see IBA ,  1987 ,  p. 17 .  )    In sharp contrast , three quarters of all newspaper readers said that the <head>papers</head> they had read on the day of the interview were biased in their coverage of the Conservative and Labour parties , though less than half said their <head>papers</head> gave biased coverage of the Alliance . ( For earlier findings on public perceptions of press bias see Kellner and Worcester ,  1982 ;  Butler and Stokes ,  1969 .  )  The direction of bias varied from paper to paper .

They asserted ,  rather than denied ,  the bias in their own preferred papers .  No doubt they chose their <head>paper</head> partly with that bias in mind . The correlation between being Conservative and alleging anti -     Conservative bias on the BBC rose from 24 per cent in the first fortnight of the campaign to 32 per cent in the second .
