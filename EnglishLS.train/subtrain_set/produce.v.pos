The authorities said that Hong Song - dam was not imprisoned merely for sending his paintings to North Korea and books to Koreans in Germany ,  but because his paintings and contributions to a magazine Art Movement  were aimed at promoting a Marxist - Leninist revolution .

In January 1991 Hong Song - dam was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment for <head>producing</head> material benefiting North Korea . Chang Ui - gyun continues to serve an eight - year sentence for espionage .

Wlflinn himself describes the Bernini statues at some length but at no point does he ever mention the subject Wlflinn was trying to isolate a visual denominator which ,  he claimed ,  was common to all works produced at the same time .  The history of forms in art has had some distinguished advocates , some of whom have been concerned with the transformation over time of one form to another ; others have been more attracted to problems of values , arguing either that styles in art change and decay , or that in a particular period there is an artistic will to <head>produce</head> work in a style of its own . These are matters which border on philosophy .  Eternal values can also be sought in art ,  as they were by the French art historian &Eacute ; lie Faure ,  whose open mind accepted disparate arts ,  a view which he expressed like this :  It is  not paradoxical at all to affirm that an Ivory Coast mask and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel express the same need to manifest a harmonious rapport which exists between mankind and the universe .

The second sentence of the issue of May 1988 refers to the first twenty years of the state :  Threatening to push the Jews into the sea ,  the Arab world reformulated the Nazi theory of Lebensraum  in Mediterranean terms :  there was no room in the region for a Jewish homeland .  Arabs who had been expelled from their land and thrust into the condition of Jewish refugees are hereby reformulated as imperialist aggressors and as Nazis .  This is reminiscent of the sort of inversion a fault - finding literary criticism can <head>produce</head> which is not to deny , which is indeed to admit , that the Arab leaders and polemicists of the region have had their faults , including some of those which have been identified over the years by Commentary . The magazine 's  line on such matters would also appear to be remote from ,  and distinctly harder than ,  that taken in its dying days by the Reagan Administration .  George Schultz travelled to the Middle East in the summer of 1988 to spread the word that the continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the frustration of Palestinian rights is a dead - end street .

Because such religious orders are themselves controlled from Rome ,  Roman discipline is conveyed via a route other than by the bishops .  Even so ,  some orders still remain slightly independent from Rome ,  particularly the religious orders of solemn vows ,  whose existence preceded the reformation .  Their numbers include the Augustinians and Dominicans , both of whom have been influential in Ireland and have <head>produced</head> theologians of liberal or left persuasion . Despite their dependency on Rome ,  the jesuits too have been important innovators on the contemporary scene in Ireland ,  particularly in the areas of education for ecumenism and industrial relations .

Roman catholic theologians teach at Trinity College ,  former bastion of protestant Ireland ,  and Roman catholic writers ,  including clergy ,  question the agreed wisdom of the Irish catholic hierarchy .  But ,  as will be seen ,  such liberal theologians have yet to achieve power within the political religious establishment .  Criticism of the Irish constitution itself from both clergy and laity <head>produced</head> one first change in the constitution . The famous paragraph of Article 42 intending to give pride of place to the Roman catholic church in the state was removed by referendum in 1972 ,  along with the accompanying paragraph recognizing other existing religious groups .  The Roman catholic hierarchy declared that they had no opposition to this particular change ,  but one wonders how the vote would have gone if they had .

A proposal before the Church of Ireland synod in May 1979 to support interdenominational education was defeated ,  despite pressure from its ecumenical lobby .  The main grounds appeared to be  the danger which it might pose to the small Southern protestant minority by encouraging mixed marriages .  However , no evidence favouring such a contention has ever been <head>produced</head> . Harry MacAdoo ,  then the Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin ,  on several occasions put forward the argument that Southern protestants were a minority group with their own culture and traditions ,  and thus deserved to have schools for themselves in order to hand on their own traditions .  When considering the merit of this argument ,  one does have to bear in mind the particularly precarious nature of the Southern protestant grouping .

It has been argued that catholic schools do not do the job for which they were set up ,  that is educate Roman catholics sufficiently to keep them in the church .  Irish bishops have been well aware of Spencer 's   ( 1968 )  research .  Using traditional measures of religiosity , he has pointed out the apparent failure of English catholic schools to <head>produce</head> better catholics and fewer ex - catholics than state or other schools , and has inferred the likelihood of the same for Irish schools . Spencer 's  argument has been banded about from time to time .  This is not unnatural ,  as in the 1970s and early 1980s Spencer was at the Queen 's  University ,  Belfast ,  and an active member of the All Children Together Movement .

In the light of W. McCready 's  findings in another study that the religious behaviour of the father had a greater impact on children ,  Greeley considered the fact that catholic schools were having an increasing influence on men to be of significant importance for the future of Roman catholicism in the USA  ( 1976 :  1735 )  .  Clearly ,  the follow - up study was more favourable to the defenders of catholic schools than to opponents .  However , Greeley and Rossi 's work also has been used to uphold the defenders ' argument that , though Roman catholic schools varied in their efficiency , they were certainly better than any possible alternative in terms of <head>producing</head> good Roman catholics . Thus ,  both sides have tended to use social scientific research to make statements in general about catholic schools which have been drawn from other countries and ,  therefore ,  beyond the cultural confines within which Irish catholic schools exist .  This is something  for which surveys ,  including that of Greeley and Rossi ,  are not and cannot be intended .

As the roots begin to break out of the grains the barley is transferred to a vast hall heated with warm air and turned by large malt shovels .  When the maltster is satisfied that germination has unlocked the rich natural sugars in the barley ,  the grains are taken to a kiln room where heat stops germination .  The temperature of the kilning process determines the type of malt <head>produced</head> : the higher the temperature the darker the malt . The malt is now ready for brewing .  In the brewery it is milled into a powder called grist and then mixed with hot water  ( known as liquor in breweries )  in a vessel called a mash tun .

Keg ,  which includes lager ,  is known in the industry as brewery conditioned beer .  Instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to add a full ,  mature palate ,  keg beers are killed off in the brewery by a number of unnatural processes that affect the taste and quality of the product .  The aim is to <head>produce</head> beers quickly which , because they are sterile and have a long shelf life , are also highly profitable . Where keg milds and bitters are concerned ,  when fermentation is complete they are conditioned for a short period in tanks under a heavy blanket of carbon dioxide .  They are then chilled and filtered to remove the remaining yeast and are usually pasteurised as well to ensure that death is complete .

Much of this is due to the face that ,  following the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on pub ownership ,  many breweries are actually moving out of brewing itself and concentrating instead on pub management  an area where they believe they stand to make the greatest profits .  At the end of the 80s the famous Manchester firm of Boddingtons sold its brewing operation to Whitbread ;  yet during 1988 alone ,  Claire Hunt has noted ,  Boddingtons undertook the refurbishment of 50 of their tied houses .  More recently , at the end of 1990 the regional brewing giant Greenall Whitley announced that it was closing both its breweries at Warrington and Nottingham ( formerly the independent Shipstone 's brewery ) to concentrate solely on running pubs contracting out its beer to be <head>produced</head> by former rivals Allied Breweries . The principal victims or beneficiaries of this change of direction are the historic tied houses .  And the principal problem facing them today is the replacement of genuine and much - loved historical features by bogus period fittings  which are invariably couched in a vaguely Victorian or Edwardian sham - historical style .

William Harrison noted in 1587 that :  In all our inns we have plenty of ale ,  beer and sundry kinds of wine and such is the capacity of some of these that they are able to lodge two hundred or three hundred persons and their horses .  In the medieval period the church was also involved in the brewing of its own church - ales , which were made on an occasional basis and <head>produced</head> a useful income supplement ; in late medieval times these were often served in the Church House that frequently adjoined the churchyard . The church - ales provided competition for the secular supply of beverages from the taverns and alehouses .  Both these establishments seem to have had an architectural form very similar to the ordinary domestic buildings of their area ,  and the hall provided the communal eating and drinking space .

For these reasons ,  when tackling the problem of gardening in the shade it is important to choose plants proficient at extracting energy from limited sunlight .  Mere tolerance of shade is not enough .  Some species may be receiving sufficient light to grow plenty of healthy foliage , but will always lack that little extra needed to <head>produce</head> flowering shoots . Variegated plants will start to make more chlorophyll in their leaves in response to restricted sunlight ,  and so tend to turn green in the shade .  Others need precise daily rations of sunlight that change with the seasons if they are to start flowering at a particular time .

Later ,  when the wind has picked up ,  the gliders weathercock round and can be free to tip over so that the into - wind wing is upwards .  Another hazard is the wind swinging and increasing during the day so that the glider ends up parked facing directly into the wind .  If the glider is facing across the wind with the into - wind wing held down , the wind will be blowing on to its top surface , <head>producing</head> an extra down - load . However ,  in a strong wind several tyres are required to stop the into - wind wing lifting up. The upper tip will be high in the air where the wind is stronger ,  while the lower wing will be close to the ground where the wind is much lighter .

It is a frightening experience ,  and I have never heard of anyone doing it a second time .  With a trailer that you have not towed before ,  your first priority should be to explore its stability carefully .  You can do this by driving on a quiet , wide road with no traffic about , gradually increasing your speed and moving the steering slightly to <head>produce</head> a very slight weave . As the speed is increased ,  the damping  becomes less and you will be able to decide on a reasonable limit to keep to for the first half hour .  By then you will have become tuned in to the driving and will be better able to judge if it is safe to go a little faster .

In flight ,  the directional or weathercock stability is maintained by the fin and rudder ,  which provide extra side area behind the c.g .  Thus with the aileron and rudder held in a central position ,  a glider will always weathercock into line with the relative airflow ,  just as the wind vane on a church steeple will always swing into the wind .  When rudder is applied , the nose of the glider yaws to the side until the force <head>produced</head> by the rudder is balanced by the tendency for the aircraft to swing back into line with the airflow . ( In the air this is nothing to do with the actual wind .  The aircraft is flying in a mass of air which may be stationary or moving .  )

In windy weather ,  the effects of the wind gradient near the ground accentuate any movement up or down of the towplane and glider .  If the towplane gains speed by flying close to the ground ,  when it noses up to start climbing ,  the effect of the wind gradient accentuates the climb so that the glider may easily be left flying close to the ground ,  in or near the wake and below the tug .  Then , when the glider pilot recognises he is far too low , any quick movement to regain position takes the glider up through the same wind gradient , causing a sudden surge of speed and <head>producing</head> an unexpected and possibly uncontrollable gain of height . At the same time ,  the extra load in the tow rope accentuates the nose - up pitching movement on the glider  ( as in a winch launch )  .  This slows down the towplane ,  leaving it at low speed below the glider and having its tail pulled up out of control .

Never having shown the same propensity as the French for violent revolution ,  the dispossessed have entered into a complex ritual of action within the processes of the criminal justice system ,  and in doing so have encouraged those tasked with their containment to consider them as being less than human and therefore needing further control and discipline .  As Wilson  ( 1981 )  ,  Reiner  ( 1985 )  ,  and others have clearly identified ,  policing is basically a socio - political tool of the state and government .  It is sustained by an intimate knowledge of its enemy the underclass of society and exemplary use is made of this knowledge to <head>produce</head> the technological and structural means for the continuity of this system of power . As we shall see ,  there is now a specifically created police culture of the dramatic ,  which incorporates illusion ,  praxis ,  and imagery as part of a well - directed social production .  It rejoices in an enhanced belief in Manichaean and mythological archetypes of good and evil which are made manifest in exaggerated games of cops and robbers .

Such a mood of concern has existed now for more than a decade and seems to mirror uncertainties of role occurring elsewhere in society .  For example ,  it can be argued the expansion into amalgamated police units has enlarged the organization to a point where it is no longer accessible to the man in the street ;  alternatively ,  it may be that the use of a centralized computer and complex technical aids has alienated the public even at the same time they are increasingly fed a diet of violent news snippets which reinforce a fear of crime and generate another folk devil of criminal menace ,  which demands the impossible :  a policeman on every corner .  In nightly theatrical TV rituals of social order and chaos , a stream of hero - policemen stand at the symbolic crossroads between peace and mayhem , and the detective and the chief officer now operate at the point where once the church and its priests declaimed on categories of good and evil and the resulting binary codes they <head>produce</head> . Inevitably ,  as a secular interpretation of morality has superseded that of established religion ,  so the  activities of the social controller have become increasingly important in the drama .  It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have remained the province of the archbishop and his clergy .

This attack was repeated again in 1987 in the Federation magazine ,  for the report had obviously hit a very raw nerve .

Furthermore ,  as these college - based insiders stress ,  their essays do not represent police college views or those of the Home Office ;  and both Thackrah  ( 1985 )  and his publisher ,  James Tindall ,  take pains to ensure from the outset that we are aware than any views expressed in the book are those of individual contributors ,  and not those of the college ,  the Home Office ,  or even the police service .  One might suggest then that the major project Holdaway recognized was missing from the college inventory is still to come !  Indeed the anonymous reviewer of the Pope and Weiner edition went on to propose that if the police staff college is to fulfil its task of <head>producing</head> a major project with any credibility , it must encourage its academic staff to go out into the field to study policing at first hand . Other challenges to social researchers to pursue a form of participant observation are to be occasionally found in the journals :  questions were being raised about what the police were doing ,  what they ought to be doing and how they ought to be organised and accountable .

He dismissed this as irrelevant and his use of metaphor ,  in what  turned out to be an eighty - minute interview ,  was most revealing .  I later recorded he invariably used the idea of an escape from real work to describe any research secondment ;  in doing so he embodied the common institutional fear of uncontrolled social movement across a divide or boundary into another society such as academia .  This is part of the ideological pedagogy which the institution uses to create and maintain defensive boundaries against the outsider or those who might <head>produce</head> a critical analysis of its systems ; it is one major strength of the organization . Again ,  as I recorded in a fieldnote ,  this assistant chief exhibited aspects of what I could only then describe as institutional paranoia ,  when he went on to deride an unnamed social scientist who had been allowed research facilities inside a police force  ( unspecified )  .  He dismissively described how this man had come in ,  taken the material provided ,  and then had written a childish and critical book on the police ,  out of which he got a Ph.D .

To have advanced within the job and achieved rank means he is likely to have followed and supported institutional precedents without question ,  and to have unwittingly accepted and been involved in the reproduction of the narrow modes of thought and practice demanded by the culture .  It is this special knowledge ,  or gnosis ,  which hopefully can make the inside ethnography so different and illuminating .  Burridge ( 1969 ) has written most persuasively about the effects which fieldwork can have on the anthropologist , describing the prophetic experience this can <head>produce</head> . He links this to the act of consciousness raising ,  which I consider presents the greatest problem for the insider who cannot leave the field or return to academia .  The insider/ethnographer can turn his understanding of an interpretive methodology to an assessment of his own actions ,  and see connections as if scales had been removed from his eyes .

Once the semantics of police experience were revealed ,  I had to live with the problems experienced by both Castenada and Favret - Saada ,  although I demur from casting myself into their intellectual companionship .

For personal transitions made across physical and psychic boundaries during the subjectivity of the field situation can <head>produce</head> disjunction ; indeed they can paralyse . In such a situation it is therefore all the more necessary to recognize the unique place the ethnographer holds and to capitalize on it .  During this time of subjective observing participation ,   the policeman/insider moves to the margins ,  to a point where analysis negates automatic approval or predisposition for a world of known categories and classifications .

By  defining  this insider fieldwork  ( and the university experience which generated it )  as a liminal situation ,  I am extending the Turnerian concept  ( 1969 ,  1974 )  in which the individual moves temporarily into an unstructured and somewhat ambiguous state ,  during the initial process of passing through a rite de passage  before returning to structure .  Here the marginality is less transitory and occurs in the post - tribal situation where the concept of liminality is less familiar to the discipline ,  even though transitions across spatial and temporal boundaries still create epistemological changes of the kind Turner describes .  In my own case , the model of transition through liminality might still <head>produce</head> a recognizable replication of the move through a rite de passage : policeman  student  new policeman But there seems more to it than that !

I suspect it is no  accident the politics of the times seems to parallel the growing toughness of the police image ,  or that the police have taken on an increasing resemblance to the black - clothed enemies of goodness who sprinkle the popular science fantasy films such as Star Wars ,  Superman  ,  and the like .  In these mass cultural replays of the eternal dichotomy between good and evil ,  the use of highly symbolic black uniforms as an indicator of anonymous evil predominates .  Within the separate police forces , the nuances of uniform difference were always embroidered by real polises to <head>produce</head> symbolic boundaries from which to assess other uniform wearers . Thus our contacts with firemen ,  St John Ambulance men ,  special constables ,  and the like were all used to define them as being somewhat unreal and therefore slightly less than human .  Such groups were said to be like the foreigners in the adjacent forces ,  for it was constantly repeated that many wanted to join us but failed because of some inadequacy .

This undermined any pre - ordained police logic we might have employed to define them , so that pressures to <head>produce</head> a unidimensional model of polis prig were simply unable to be maintained , although we did home in on such facets as their long hair and frequently unwashed state to polarize them as binary animals , in contrast to our human status . And so although they were still the opposition ,  they could rarely be classified as real prigs .  We therefore became aberrant policemen simply because what we were now living was not programmed by previous organizational knowledge and habit .

When this picture was fully developed ,  even space was represented not as being qualitatively the way it is in vision ,  but as a structural isomorph of visual and tactile space .  By this point ,  every knowable quality was confined to the mind .  But the modern behaviourist and functionalist analyses of mind treat mental states as mere powers to <head>produce</head> behaviour : that is , they abolish the intrinsic qualitative content of mental states , replacing it by causal , hence relational , properties . We have then reached the absurd position that nothing in the world possesses a knowable intrinsic or qualitative nature ,  for all properties are essentially relational .  This predicament arises out of the demise of consciousness ,  when only consciousness ,  understood in a traditional way ,  can bring us face to face with ,  and hence give us any grasp on ,  the qualitative ,  as opposed to relational ,  properties .

Nevertheless ,  they have demonstrated activity in the visual areas during an imaging task ,  in the language areas during a verbal task and even ,  on one  -  occasion ,  in the higher visual areas of a schizophrenic patient who subsequently reported that he had been hallucinating .

Recent experiments on the psychophysiology of selective attention by ,  for example ,  Steven Hillyard at San Diego and Emanuel Donchin at Illinois have successfully related different endogenous components in the ERP to different stages in the process of selective attention .  Suppose a subject is listening to different sequences of sounds played independently to each ear through a pair of headphones in order to pick out and respond to a particular target sound .  If the subject is instructed to attend to one ear and ignore the sounds coming into the other ear , all the sounds in the attended ear will <head>produce</head> an enhanced N100 component in the ERP . ( The name N100 indicates a systematically occurring negative shift in the ERP which peaks about 100 msec after the stimulus .  )  This enhancement is thought to be associated with the extraction of additional information about the stimuli in the attended ear .

Finally , the phonemes are blended together to <head>produce</head> the spoken response . The alternative pronunciation route ,  which involves addressed phonology ,  employs the lexical system .  Initially ,  an entry in a reading lexicon which matches the sequence of letters that one has detected is located .

I have gone into such detail about individual patients to try to convince you first ,  that it can be misleading to categorize patients too narrowly into groups ,  and second ,  that the dual - route model I described can accommodate a wide variety of data from different individual cases .  There is an equally important additional point that I want to make .  Since brain damage can <head>produce</head> these very precise differences between patients , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there is one part of the brain that has the precise function of carrying out each piece of information processing that is specified within the cognitive model . It seems to me to be perverse in the extreme to attempt to resist the claim that the brain is literally carrying out these functions .  Cognitive neuropsychology thus provides powerful evidence that the level of analysis which functionalists use to describe brain processes is the correct one .

Muller 's  nineteenth - century  doctrine of specific energies  formalized the ordinary observation that different sense organs are sensitive to different physical properties of the world and that when they are stimulated ,  sensations specific to those organs are experienced .  It was proposed that there are endings  ( or receptors )  within the nervous system which are attuned to specific types of energy ,  For example ,  retinal receptors in the eye respond to light energy ,  cochlear endings in the ear to vibrations in the air ,  and so on .  Of course , high energy stimulation even of the wrong kind may stimulate a sensory ending ; for example , excessive pressure on the eyeball will <head>produce</head> a sensation of light . Contrariwise ,  over - intense stimulation of the appropriate kind will evoke pain .  These are ,  however ,  abnormal situations ;  for ordinary perception ,  the doctrine of specific energies holds .

Intentionality is usually overlooked by causal theorists who tend to see their job as being to sort out the afferent limb .  It is therefore especially ironical that the neurophysiological CTP ,  which locates the basis of perception literally in the head ,  at a particular place away from the perceived object ,  actually sharpens the mystery of intentionality .  For nature , after all , offers no other examples of causal chains in which events causally downstream refer back to the objects that are involved in <head>producing</head> their causal ancestors . The intentionality of perceptions  and indeed of other mental phenomena  makes them non - analogous to material phenomena outside of the nervous system .  And nothing that takes place within the nervous system can explain why this property of intentionality should emerge there .

Slightly shorter in length ,  and with a 90sq in headsize rather than the 95 and 105 which are currently the norm ,  the Challenge 26 is also lighter and specially balanced to suit female and junior players .  It features a highly aerodynamic wide - body graphite frame for easy manoeuvrability and greater power and includes Slazenger 's  Optimum Mass System at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions on the frame to extend the sweet spot and so improve playability and ball control .

Who indeed could have forecast that the Provincial sector would be announcing such an improvement in their financial situation resulting from rapid but targeted investment in new trains ,  with the prime objective of cost reduction ?

It was intended as a high - performance set which could inherit the reliability associated with previous BR  ( SR )  DEMUs ,  thus beating the older ,  inherently unreliable diesel - mechanical multiple units hands down. Its problem ,  when analysed by the new Provincial sector was its price :  it would cost too much to enable a financial case to be made for the 210 breed to replace existing DMUs even taking asbestos removal into account .  The other design in the offing was the two - axle railbus which had started life as a Research Division project aimed at combining high - speed freightvehicle technology with that of the standard Leyland road bus in order to <head>produce</head> a low cost diesel train . This was certainly a cheap option ,  and there were some short -  or medium - distance routes where such a basic vehicle was considered acceptable .

No better example can be given than by citing the careers of Tamara Karsavina and Margot Fonteyn ,  both of whom worked with many different choreographers as well as submitting themselves to the severely classical discipline of the older Petipa repertoire .  A general view  There is a third type of choreographer who <head>produces</head> ballets which give audiences great pleasure through the sheer variety of their virtuoso designs . Because of the interesting ,  usually technical ,  demands made on the performers ,  their ballets often become testing grounds for future soloists .  Variations from such ballets as Petipa 's  Don Quixote ,  Raymonda  and La Bayadre  and Bournonville 's  Napoli  are still considered by most classical dancers to be more technically demanding than the more complex twistings and turnings of modern choreographers who mix their styles .

Today there are many ballets which are created in the generally accepted styles from which choreographers can borrow :  classical ,  demi - caractre  ,  romantic ,  character and/or national ,  and modern  ( see pages 75138 )  .  However ,  when necessary ,   choreographers can and should create a particular style that is perhaps based on a mixture of the above but that is ,  in the final analysis ,  a style suitable for one ballet only .  Such choreographers as Ashton , MacMillan and Robbins have <head>produced</head> some ballets which have an exclusive style of their own . The most outstanding are possibly Monotones ,  Gloria  and Afternoon of a Faun  .  Although the movements in all three are classically based ,  they would look out of place in older classical ballets or danced to other music .

By 1717 these gestures were accepted practice by actors to reinforce the meaning of the words spoken and particularly by members of the commedia dell'arte travelling troupes who <head>produced</head> mime plays . In these the expert gestures and extemporised playing of easily recognised characters in certain stock situations were understood by audiences everywhere no matter what the native language because the gestures were so explicit .  These gestures were first listed by monks in the tenth century .

The rest of the world drinks mainly lager beers and even in countries such as Belgium where ale - type beers are produced they come to fruition in the bottle rather than in the cask .  The British drink most of their beer in draught rather than bottled form .  A cask ale is brewed from the finest malting barley , <head>produced</head> in the main in East Anglia , with the addition of English hop varieties . Before barley can be used in a brewery it must be turned into malt .  This requires great skill in encouraging the barley to germinate ,  producing the natural starches that will provide sugar for fermentation .

Before barley can be used in a brewery it must be turned into malt .

When the hopped wort has been cooled it is run to fermenting vessels where it meets its destiny with yeast .  The type of yeast strain used for ale is known as top fermenting .  It works at a warm temperature and vigorously turns the sugars in the wort into alcohol and carbon dioxide , <head>producing</head> at the same time ripe fruity aromas that add to the pleasure of ale drinking . The great head of yeast created during fermentation is cropped off and after a week the remaining yeast is overcome by the alcohol it has produced and sinks to the bottom of the fermenter .  The liquid is now officially called beer but it needs a few days further conditioning in the brewery ,  to purge some of the rough alcohols ,  before it is ready to leave for the pub .

With little promotional support ,  cask ale sales are rising and now account for 20 per cent of the total beer market .

A range of these exist from simple compressed hop pellets to Pre - Isomerised Kettle Extracts ,  more affectionately known as PIKE .

The resulting pellets are termed Type 90 reflecting the high percentage of hop material present compared to water and foreign matters .

The pickup coil remains a single winding over the toroid  ( Fig. 8 )  .  By these modifications the sought - after simplicity is achieved ,  coupled with the virtual elimination of all high - level signals .  As an additional benefit , the closed magnetic circuit of a toroidal core greatly reduces the drive requirements to <head>produce</head> saturation levels , simplifying the circuitry need by the system . It may be felt that replacing two straight cores with a ring structure is too drastic a change to gloss over ,  but the mechanism is not too different in the two cases .  Figure 9 represents the way in which the lines of force are concentrated from the immediate vicinity and makes plausible the idea that an overwound coil would not see much difference in the flux changes it experiences from either system .

This radiation may increase the depth of the D layer due to ionisation and <head>produce</head> the all too well known Dellinger face out when long - distance HF communication ceases abruptly . Corpuscular or particulate radiation appears in the form of protons and neutrons which take longer to reach the earth 's  upper atmosphere than the higher energy radiations .
