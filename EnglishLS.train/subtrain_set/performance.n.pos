Is it criticism  ?  There is a massive amount of writing about art ,  only some of which can immediately be identified by a reader as criticism .  Writing by the art critic of a newspaper is self - evidently criticism , in parallel with the writing of music and theatre critics ; an exhibition can be treated almost in the same way as a <head>performance</head> . Articles in magazines are less certainly described as criticism ,  for their main topics may be personalities or history ,  and art may be only a small part of the writers '  account .  Books and catalogues may contain criticism ;  but their writers may think of themselves as art historians ,  philosophers ,  aestheticians ,  anthropologists ,  historians or biographers ,  and there are many other possibilities ;  their books may never be identified as art criticism .

Let us walk with a visitor through the city ,  a veteran of the Second World War who values it as one which was almost unscathed from the bombing which devastated so many European cities .  He starts at a medieval Gothic window ,  a remnant of the first university in central Europe  ( founded 1348 )  ;  he pauses at the rebuilt Bethlehem Chapel ,  the site of where the Mass was first allowed in Czech ,  and Jan Hus preached before being burnt for heresy in 1413 ;  he pays respects to the relics of the Jewish quarter with its ancient and crowded graveyard ;  to cross the river he uses the Charles Bridge ,  lined with Baroque statues  ( many between 1700 and 1720 )  ,  and climbs the hill to the Castle where art and architecture of all periods again further embellish the golden city of central Europe .  In the evening our friend has supper in the art nouveau interior of the Hotel Europe , before going to a <head>performance</head> at the National Theatre , built in the 1880s as a monument to the Czech national spirit , pinioned under the Austro - Hungarian Empire . As he has enjoyed his day ,  he sleeps soundly without a nightmare about what was specifically Czechoslovak in the sights .  The truth is that nationality in art has limited importance .

Historians can point to the philosophical views which underlay this ambition ,  and artists and sculptors were in various ways affected by the demonstration of its realisation in the theatre built for the composer at Bayreuth .  The collaboration of artists with the stage was also brought to a high point by Serge Diaghilev ,  in his commissions to artists for the Russian Ballet .  This connection between painting and the theatre was important to earlier European art in religious as well as secular <head>performances</head> . Critics no less than artists have wide interests in the arts ,  and may introduce comparisons in their interpretations .

Clearly artists working in several media have a wide range of references .  The art critic is thus bound to consider with care what standards of comparison should be used .  In the late twentieth century artists working in <head>performance</head> pose difficulties for the critic , though some observers find it refreshing rather than troublesome to consider work beyond the easel picture and the individual sculpture . In sum ,  then ,  the monograph is a major site for art critical writing ,  and ,  moreover ,  the place where the most extended criticism is likely to appear .  The reader may be disappointed by the standard of what is written ,  but unlike other sites of criticism ,  this cannot be attributed to the form of publication ,  only to the limitations of the author .

When we turn to the theatre the question of scale is also significant .  The theatre is larger than life ,  not in terms of physical scale ,  but because movements and speech are comparatively emphatic and intense ,  even when a play simulates everyday natural surroundings .  Some people find this makes theatre less believable less true to their own experience and therefore less convincing than the more restrained <head>performances</head> seen on television and cinema . Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage  the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the audience are vitally connected to what is going on .  As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself ,  and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for .

What you will eventually be working towards is a fusion of instinct and technique ,  and training is very largely to do with improving technical skills .  At drama school ,  there is constant attention to a student 's  control of both voice and movement ,  and the different departments work at developing a student 's  overall acting technique .  The emphasis will be on developing an actor 's mental and physical concentration , and giving him/her sufficient craftsmanship to sustain a <head>performance</head> .

The piece tests the actor 's  awareness and imagination to the full ,  but nevertheless makes precise demands on him :  he must follow exactly what the author says .  Throughout drama school there will be continuous work on acting solo pieces ,  and both singing and acting tutorials are usually conducted on a one to one basis  ( more on tutorials in chapter 7 )  .  Of course the student also needs to learn how to co - ordinate dialogue with all of the necessary actions and movements which are part of the natural traffic of <head>performance</head> , and learn about prop handling . Classes help the actor to gain confidence in dealing with many things happening at the same time ,  and this is an important part of student work .  Radio ,  television and film classes

Unfortunately ,  it is often difficult to get agents to attend these productions .

In the West End there seems at the moment a tendency to rely too much on the goodwill of actors which is often accompanied by a failure to maintain a true interest in what is going on for the actor .

After a launch failure of any kind above two or three hundred feet ,  once the speed has been checked ,  it is best to turn off 90 or so in order to avoid going further from the field .  In this position ,  the glider is on a base leg for any available field upwind and it is easy to look back and decide whether returning to the field is practical .  On a normal tow , except for very low <head>performance</head> machines , the climbing angle of the towplane and glider is much steeper than the glider 's gliding angle when flying downwind . So ,  in theory ,  the glider should be within easy reach of the gliding site .  However ,  in turbulent and windy conditions it is always better to play safe and land into wind in another field ,  rather than to make a downwind landing .

It is alarming to hear how many relatively inexperienced pilots seem completely unaware of the risks they take when pitting their skills against the forces of nature .  They often think that if their flying is good enough ,  it is safe for them to press on in any weather conditions .  The <head>performance</head> of modern gliders makes it much easier and more likely for a pilot to fly himself into a potential death trap unless he uses his imagination or has already learned to have a healthy respect for the elements . The result has been a noticeable increase in the number of pilots who suddenly find themselves faced with a situation far beyond their control ,  usually a situation that they had not even considered at the start of the flight .  In most respects ,  using wave lift is far safer than cloud flying for attempts at Gold and Diamond heights .

In cases of phonological dyslexia ,  the patient finds it almost impossible to read any word with which he or she was unfamiliar prior to brain injury .  However they can still read a very high percentage of pre - morbidly familiar words accurately ,  regardless of their spelling .  This pattern of <head>performance</head> suggests that these patients find it difficult to assemble a pronunciation , but they can continue to read familiar words because the lexical system , utilizing addressed phonology , is still working effectively . This means that they are able to retrieve the appropriate pronunciation of a word as a whole from the speech output lexicon .  The dual - route model of reading is thus able not only to explain an existing set of data within a simple theoretical model ,  it also successfully pinpointed the existence of an entirely new type of acquired dyslexia .

In the 1970s there were only two types of potential replacement DMU being considered by BR 's  passenger marketing people and the engineers .  The Class 210 diesel - electric design of three - car or four - car unit had actually been produced to a business specification developed in conjunction with the board 's  passenger commercial managers .  It was intended as a high - <head>performance</head> set which could inherit the reliability associated with previous BR ( SR ) DEMUs , thus beating the older , inherently unreliable diesel - mechanical multiple units hands down. Its problem ,  when analysed by the new Provincial sector was its price :  it would cost too much to enable a financial case to be made for the 210 breed to replace existing DMUs even taking asbestos removal into account .  The other design in the offing was the two - axle railbus which had started life as a Research Division project aimed at combining high - speed freightvehicle technology with that of the standard Leyland road bus in order to produce a low cost diesel train .

But the new two - axle units were actually responsible for part of the upsurge in traffic on their routes and were certainly no worse than the buses with which they were successfully competing .  Meanwhile ,  however ,  it had become clear that there had to be a replacement DMU which was placed midway in size and cost between the railbuses and the 210 units .  But , if underfloor engines and transmissions were to be used , they had to be in a different league of reliability and <head>performance</head> from the DMUs which BR had been running since the 1950s . Fortunately ,  some experience had been building up on the European continent ,  in Holland in particular ,  with DMUs which had very reliable and  cost - effective engines and transmissions .  The Nederlands Railways 3100 and 3200 Class units employ Cummins diesel engines with Voith hydraulic transmission driving through permanently engaged final drives on the axles .

There have even been attempts to stage biographies ,  one of the first being Loring 's  Billy the Kid   ( see page 30 )  .  Choreographers who are inspired to interpret music can do so in many ways ,  all of which can be successful ,  but only if they remember that its overall rhythm is not merely a mechanical guide to the timing of the steps within the dance design  ( see page 68 )  .  The second meaning of the word impetus should be applied to the actual <head>performance</head> of any step or pose in the purely technical sense . That is ,  the choreographer must understand from which part of the body impetus is to be given so that the step achieves its full purpose at the proper moment  usually in some gesture and its musical emphasis .  The moment can be as the dancer pauses momentarily in a pose ,  as a comma in the middle or as a full stop at the end of a sentence .

Or the moment can be an important point in an overall design to fill space ,  such as the moment in a grand jet en avant  when the dancer 's  two legs are at an equal height from the ground and he or she appears to travel onwards effortlessly through space .  It can also be the moment when a dancer moves into a pirouette  and spins before holding a pose .  However , more important is the third meaning of impetus which has also to do with physical <head>performance</head> . Impetus is again needed ,  particularly in a story ballet ,  when it has to be given to emphasise the significance of a step .  This always used to happen in older ballets when the hero would take a step forward with a slight stamp before he swore to marry the heroine .

The above definition may at first seem to have little to do with a choreographer 's  work .  But if the choreographer does not understand all the details which go to make the total presentation of a ballet ,  it can all too easily fail in some way or other. Merely to count all the details that it is necessary to accumulate from the preparation of a scenario and score through rehearsal to public <head>performance</head> should make it clear that co - operation from other artists as well as from dancers is required . There must be a librettist  if the choreographer does not plan out the plot  a composer or arranger of music ,  a designer for set and costumes and all those associated with sets and props ,  painting stage - managing ,  lighting and everything else needed to get the curtain up. An understanding of mass in choreographic terms only means how to organise and manipulate the dancers within that mass of objects .

In every enchanement  each step an/or pose must be given its appropriate value by way of beginning ,  climax and end so that its place is justified by its importance to the whole sentence .  This does not mean that today 's  choreographers need follow the conventions laid down by the Renaissance scholars who were more interested in the physical ability and behaviour of courtiers .  They were not creative artists but they were and still remain for the most part arbiters of technique and the niceties of perfect <head>performance</head> . The originality of so much of   Ashton 's  and MacMillan 's  choreography fur classical ballets lies in the way they follow the basic principles and rules in order to create an infinite variety of enchanements  from the traditional vocabulary of steps ,  and yet discard the conventions .

So explicit are the tiny gestures and the perfect timing of exits and entrances that the audience is forced to recognise the personal tragedy of a love that spoke no words .  Although MacMillan 's  choreography fur both the above ballets is based on classical technique ,  it in no way conforms to the old school of dance or conventional mime .  To portray specific characters , whether imagined or real ( some were known to members of the audience at the first <head>performance</head> of Enigma Variations and Isadora ) , the would - be choreographer can use classical dance as a firm base but must pay more attention to his characters as particular individuals . They live and work in a more varied ,  often plebeian ,  environment than that of courtiers in the palace of a prince .  The latter ,  after all ,  was the stereotype setting fur all classical ballet until 1789 ,  the year of the french Revolution .

Petipa attempted this in The Daughter of Pharaoh  .  This type of choreography was taken up by later music - hall acts whose very eccentric soft shoe ,  sand dances before a background of pyramids and palm trees aroused much laughter .

He started by sketching numerous frescoes and statuettes he found in the Hermitage Museum ,  Leningrad .  From such ideas he formed dances which did away with pointes  but retained much of the classical footwork which he co - ordinated with the less familiar action of the arms and hands .

She later shows her mettle as a clog dancer abetted by four pretty girls ,  tries to set her cap at Father Thomas ,  but finally realises she cannot frustrate true love and dances out happily with the rest .  This English pantomime tradition Ashton also exploited earlier in his choreography for the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella  where he followed the tradition that one is always a somewhat modest violet bossed about by her dragon of a sister .  This double characterisation was made more hilarious at the first <head>performances</head> when the bossy one was danced by Helpmann , and later the taller MacMillan , with wonderfully extended dvelopps , and the shyer one by Ashton with dainty attempts to be correct at all costs . A similar incongruous matching of the very tall girl with one of the shortest boys in MacMillan 's  Elite Syncopations  reveals that he ,  too ,  understands that old music - hall and pantomime practices are a wonderful source of inspiration if a British audience is to laugh and enjoy the occasion as the dancers do .  Another commedia dell'arte character whose play has influenced too few choreographers is that of Harlequin ,  a maker of mischief ,  a magicker of spells ,  an animal impersonator and always a great dancer .

Patio doors are made in timber ,  aluminium and plastic  ( unplasticised polyvinyl chloride ,  or upvc for short )  .  These materials are sometimes used in combination  aluminium doors may be set in a timber sub - frame ,  for example ,  and upvc doors usually have steel reinforcement inside their box sections for extra strength .  Timber doors are usually made either from preservativetreated softwood , or a rot - resistant hardwood such as mahogany , and many have high - <head>performance</head> specifications that include integral weather - stripping and sealed - unit double glazing .

Wood generally ,  and wooden windows in particular ,  are prone to rotting .  Test the surface for sponginess by probing it with a screwdriver and renew rotten timber either by replacing complete sections with new preservative - treated wood ,  or by cutting - in new sections of wood ,  or if the area of rot is not too extensive ,  by replacing the decay using a modern wood repair system as made by Ronseal and Cuprinol .  The basis of both these systems is a wood hardener which strengthens the decayed wood fibres , and a two - part high <head>performance</head> wood filler . In both cases ,  the wood should be as dry as possible when the wood hardener is applied ,  and when this is dry ,  the two - part epoxy - resin wood filler is pressed into the cavity to give a noncrack ,  non - shrink repair .  A sander will be required to remove excess filler and shape it to match the existing timber .

a 640 by 480 pixel 16 colour screen has 307,200 pixels ,  each described by four bits ,  thus requiring 153.6 Kbyte of storage .  So bit image files frequently use data compression .

When the new version of the C compiler is released ,  I sincerely hope that Motorola does not charge for the update ,  I also hope it provides an adequate manual not like the scant document which accompanied version 1.233 .

Also driving the phase detectors is the reference oscillator chain ,  which consists of a crystal oscillator with an external crystal resonating at up to 16.8MHz and a reference divider in two sections .  The first section is programmed to give an output at 1.2MHz and the second to produce 12.5kHz or 15kHz output to the phase detectors ,  a wide choice of frequency input thereby being possible .  Two phase detectors , analogue and digital , work together to produce good noise <head>performance</head> and fast locking . When lock is achieved ,  the digital detector is switched out of circuit to avoid noise denigration in the analogue circuit .

This must seem a promising start for RDS for which first receivers appeared only in 1987 .  Consumers wary of poor performance Broadcasters have been none too happy with <head>performance</head> of some of the earlier sets . Mark Saunders  ( BBC Radio )  in a personal review of design requirements for RDS car radios points out that one of the problems that RDS poses for both broadcaster and receiver manufacturer is that ,  with the exception of obvious features such as the display of the programme service name ,  an RDS receiver is not apparently different in performance ,  or looks ,  when observed in the static environment of the dealer 's  showroom .  So from the point of view of the consumer ,  there are few tests that can be done prior to purchase ,  to ascertain how well a product will perform when fitted into the car .

So from the point of view of the consumer ,  there are few tests that can be done prior to purchase ,  to ascertain how well a product will perform when fitted into the car .  He says that it is a sad fact that many early RDS receivers failed to perform even basic tasks adequately ,  and many people have been put off RDS for life because of :  experiences with receivers that performed inadequately and which failed to live up to the promises the broadcasters made for them .  Mr Saunders goes on to admit that broadcasters are not entirely blameless in this respect : More should no doubt have been done at an earlier stage in development of RDS to give the receiver manufacturing industry some guidelines setting out the minimum levels of RDS <head>performance</head> that should be achieved . His belief is that it is preferable if the RF tuner and RDS processing stages of the receiver are continuously active whenever the vehicle ignition is switched on .  The on/off switch on the front panel should only control the power amplifiers and display functions .

Admittedly ,  conditions in the American academy are a little tighter than they once were ,  but what looks like stringency by American standards is still lavishness by British ones .  Britain can never hope to compete with all this .

In this climate ,  the academic in English and other subjects in the humanities ,  who is busy ,  who publishes a lot ,  who goes to conferences ,  cannot but be preferred to the quiet scholar ,  who keeps a low profile ,  even seems rather idle ,  but is taking his time over a major piece of scholarly writing that may involve many years '  work and which he does not intend to give to the world until he is ready .

Academics in English are loners reluctant to engage in team projects or pull together in research centres .  They can be irritatingly slow to publish ,  and it is often difficult to know how they spend their time .  On the brighter side , there are those younger and more active lecturers who do their duty and generate <head>performance</head> - indicators in the form of books and articles . It is true that in some cases these publications may be of extreme radical tendency ,  attacking the established  practices of academic English teaching ,  but that is no objection ,  since it is the fact of publication that counts ,  not its content .  The real problem is that the writers of such texts may make political difficulties within a department ,  or teach in ways difficult for students to understand .

OPERA NORTH 's  Tosca ,  first produced last year ,  is revived with a new conductor and two new principals ,  once again headed by the flame - haired Tosca of Mary Jane Johnson .  If its dramatic focus seems different ,  it is because Carlo Rizzi 's  tempi are rather faster than those adopted by Clive Timms ;  the action progresses less with inexorability than by abrupt shifts of mood .  Perhaps not every chord was quite in place , but this remains orchestrally an exciting <head>performance</head> ; occasional poor balance between voice and stage emanates , I think , from the acoustic properties of the set . Johnson remains nearly ideal as the jealous ,  mercurial prima donna .  Her powerful and eloquent singing really does not need to be supplemented by low - register Sprechstimme ;  one can see the point ,  but Puccini is near enough to raw melodrama without such mannerism .

As a young doctor in Leiden he paid a seminal visit to the neuroanatomist WJH Nauta ,  at that time developing a revolutionary anatomical technique for investigating the nervous system by staining degenerating fibres cut off from their parent cell - bodies .  Kuypers was the first to use this technique in studies of the brain and over the next 10 years ,  now in the United States ,  he charted at a new level of detail the connections made by the cerebral cortex with nervous elements in the brain - stem and spinal cord that control movement in a number of higher mammals .  Kuypers then started a long series of collaborative studies in which injuries to some of these connections in the monkey 's brain were correlated with the defects they produced in <head>performance</head> of movements ; the poising of an arm , for instance , to carry out an operation with the fingers could be dissociated from the ability to use the fingers skilfully . These studies continued ,  with increasing sophistication ,  after his return to Europe in 1966 as Professor of Anatomy at the new Erasmus University in Rotterdam .  He showed that injury to connections within the cerebral cortex could cause the dissociation of hand movements guided by vision from those guided by touch .

We wanted revenge and I think we all felt the pressure because we wanted to win so badly ,  said Wood ,  who looked more like she was enjoying herself .  In contrast ,  at times Durie looked ready to scream ,  especially when the errors started creeping in during the second set of her 6 - 2 ,  7 - 6 win over the promising Yayuk Basuki .  Indeed , it was something of a typically topsy - turvy but none the less gritty <head>performance</head> from Durie , who missed a match point at 5 - 3 and then had to wait an hour to complete the encounter after rain fell at the end of the ninth game . She completed victory by taking the tiebreak 7 - 5 but not before she lost her serve to 5 - 5 and then saved a set point at 5 - 6 .  Such was the importance placed on the result by the players themselves that team manager Sue Mappin felt she was able to describe the win as a huge boost .

He was in the Lilian Baylis 1937 season at the Old Vic and returned to the Westminster for Pygmalion ,  Richard III ,  and more O'Neill ,  including a memorable portrayal of the old Ephraim Cabot in Desire Under The Elms in 1940 .

In the last minute ,  Bernie Gallacher ,  the Villa full - back ,  denied Wolves the chance of extra time when he headed Shane Westley 's  header from under the bar .  Wolves have now failed to progress beyond the second round since they won the then League Cup in 1980 .  If the result was not one for Graham Turner to celebrate on the third anniversary of his takeover at Wolves , the manner of their <head>performance</head> should certainly cheer him on his 42nd birthday today . It took Wolves 15 seconds to bring a Black Country barrage from the stands with their first ,  booming aerial pass for Bull to pursue ;  a further 30 seconds for Villa to concede a corner ;  and two minutes for Nigel Spink to be forced into a sprawling save by Mark Venus .  A pass from Venus sounds like the definitive long - ball game ,  and Villa 's  central defenders ,  Paul McGrath and Mountfield ,  did well to defend a series of attacks that came out of the night sky .

Islamey was followed by a rather quirky <head>performance</head> of Beethoven 's Third Piano Concerto , in which the soloist was the 22 - year - old Olli Mustonen , a compatriot of the conductor . Comparisons are sometimes drawn between this work and Mozart 's  great K491 Concerto in the same key ,  which Beethoven is known to have played and admired .  The similarities ,  however ,  are mostly in matters of device  ( the piano arpeggios in the first movement Coda ,  for example ,  and the six - eight ending of the Rondo ,  tragic in Mozart ,  brilliant in Beethoven )  .

Overheating and loose valvegear chains ,  both of which can abruptly extinguish all mechanical life ,  are its  ( avoidable )  weaknesses .  With the wisdom of hindsight ,  it is easy to see now that the Stag 's  troublesome V8 ,  designed and inadequately developed in - house by Triumph before it merged with Leyland ,  should have been ditched and replaced by Rover 's  proven ex - Buick 3.5 - litre V8  ( still used by Land - Rover ,  Morgan ,  TVR and others )  that was already on the shelf .  In the interests of dependability , many Stags have subsequently been converted to Rover V8 power , gaining in reliability ( and quite possibly in <head>performance</head> ) what they lose in originality and nose heaviness . A Rover - engine Stag may well be a better car than one with Triumph power ,  but as a hybrid it will never be so valuable .  Ford V6 conversions are intrinsically even less desirable  though worth considering as a cheap and reliable engine .

Still owned by its employees ,  Meiko has broken into the American and Japanese supercomputer markets ,  and now has offices across the US and in Europe .  The largest of its Computing Surface machines is at the University of Edinburgh .  Faced with the loss of their previous high - <head>performance</head> computer in 1987 , the university got backing from the Science and Engineering Research Council and the Department of Trade and Industry to purchase a large Computing Surface to serve both as a research vehicle and a flagship site for Meiko . The Edinburgh Concurrent Supercomputer Project  ( ECSP )  ,  under Professor David Wallace ,  now has the largest parallel computer in Europe ,  with 400 processors which can perform 400 million arithmetical calculations a second .  The example of the installation at Edinburgh has led to several million dollars '  worth of business which ,  according to Meiko ,  would have been much harder to obtain without a such a proof of cost - effectiveness .

The winner may now become Glover 's  first runner in a Group race .  His mission had been planned two years ago when he worked well with stablemate Balthus ,  the 1987 Cambridgeshire winner ,  and Glover promises he has something else in the yard to continue the trend in two years .  For the successful jockey , Dean McKeown , it was some compensation for the dismal <head>performance</head> of 2,000 Guineas hope Message Pad on Friday . McKeown has not given up on the north 's  hope for next year 's  Classic ,  who was found to have a temperature after finishing last in the Somerville Tattersall Stakes .  He 's  got a real motor ,  but that day the engine fell out ,  said the jockey .

When you are always trying to make your best shots you sometimes miss .  In a long match like this it is really difficult to play your best for three and a half hours .  Lendl 's concern that Mecir 's shrewder shots would pass him in mid - court made for a characteristic back - court <head>performance</head> and a 6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 victory for a 100,000 ( 62,500 ) prize . While it would be a mistake to regard such matches too seriously when they lack the edge of grand prix conditions ,  Lendl 's  tactical reticence was interesting .  Mecir could not envisage his fellow Czechoslovak changing a successful routine .

England 0 Australia .  .  0 STEVE TAYLOR probably established himself as the rightful successor to his more famous namesake ,  Ian ,  when he gave an outstanding performance of goalkeeping in England 's  final game in the Lada Classic at Luton yesterday  -  a goalless draw with the world champions .  The result was enough ,  however ,  to give Australia the trophy .  Following their disappointing <head>performance</head> against the Dutch on Saturday when they lost 5 - 1 , England made a number of changes , including dropping captain Richard Leman and introducing a young right - wing triangle of Chris Mayer , Russell Garcia and Rob Hill . It was Mayer who gave the experienced Michael York a torrid afternoon and created a string of opportunities with penetrating crosses .  Only sound keeping by Lachlan Dreher in the Australian goal and poor finishing denied England a victory they fully deserved .

It was the champions '  first defeat since losing to Hull in the First Division at the start of April  a run of 13 successive victories .  Jeff Hardy led the Sheffield spree with two tries ;  the others came from Bruce McGuire ,  Warren Smiles and Sonny Nickle ,  with Mark Aston kicking five goals .  The Eagles ' manager , Gary Hetherington , said afterwards : It was a tremendous <head>performance</head> and a great day for us . What made it more significant was that over 7,000 Sheffield fans were following us .  A year ago ,  the Eagles were drawing three - figure crowds to Owlerton greyhound stadium .
