Interest was expressed in all of the organisational aspects of home care including nursing ,  equipment loans and the volunteer programme .  Like ACET ,  CAH will give both medical and practical help to AIDS patients in the home .

What should you do if you do n't live in London ,  and find that it is financially difficult to pay for such courses ?  The best way to find out about what is available to you more locally is to contact your County Drama Adviser and also the Regional Arts Association for your area ,  who will have details about part - time training for young actors  ( see Appendix A )  .  Amateur theatre flourishes almost everywhere , and when you 're <head>beginning</head> it cannot be stressed too strongly that it is desirable to obtain some actual stage experience before jumping into the big pool of drama school , or even summer school . Once again ,  the Regional Arts Association will know the leading amateur companies in your area ,  and this should certainly help you in looking for the kind of group to which you are best suited .  The British Theatre Association ,  mentioned in the first edition of this book ,  has for decades offered professional and all - embracing training courses for actors ,  directors ,  and young people .

Eighty years does n't seem a very long time when you consider the art of acting has been prospering in Europe over the last four hundred or so years ,  quite apart from the great traditions of ancient Greek drama .  But it is certainly true that in the last sixty years the various schools and academies of acting have had a significant effect on the climate of acting .

But the British government was still involved in the reproduction of antagonisms in the Ulster statelet ,  rather than passively accepting the perpetuation of inequalities and discrimination against the catholic  nationalist minority .  O'Dowd ,  Rolston ,  and Tomlinson  ( 1980 )  point out that when the centralized state comes in simply to administer and maintain law and order ,  it tends to reproduce relationships which pre - exist its intervention .  When the British state <head>began</head> its policies of social interventionism from 1945 , it succeeded in fragmenting the local power base of unionism by centralizing the sources of welfare and making them at least in part available across the sectarian divide . There was thus some impact on discrimination .  However ,  when Stormont was abolished in 1972 and central government took over entirely the responsibility for local administration ,  it adopted the technocratic ,  non - policy making approach to its new role .

Testing the Alliance 2 :  The Mother and Child Scheme Controversy The second case reveals even more the extent to which the legitimation of the state was a Roman catholic affair ,  at least as one of the two principal sources of power in the alliance .  From the early 1940s , the Irish government <head>began</head> to work towards the introduction of a comprehensive health service for mothers and children in line with other legislative developments in Western countries . There can be no doubt that the lack of such a programme bore heavily upon the poor ,  and that poor health and mortalities were a consequence .  In 1946 there were already signs of clerical opposition to any socialization of welfare in queries about Fianna Fil 's  proposals from Archbishop McQuaid and the Confederation of Convent Schools .

When the next government under de Valera introduced a very limited scheme of public health assistance in 1952 ,  the hierarchy still opposed its introduction ,  and by direct methods as well .  Only de Valera 's  personal intervention convinced them of their lack of perception and judgement .  It was the 1960s before the bishops <head>began</head> to distance themselves from direct relationships with the government of the day . It could be argued that such a strategy was in any case unnecessary .  However ,  it was not simply a strategy ,  but  embodied a particular ideology :  the belief that the bishops were the church above all ,  and that they ,  not the laity ,  were the ones to communicate with the state .

Similar remarks were made by Senator Mary Robinson ,  who also challenged the hierarchy 's  intent in their statement to the New Ireland Forum that the civil rights of Northerners would not be infringed by any pressure from the Roman catholic church in an eventual united Ireland .

Religious education in these schools is officially non - denominational or biblically based and loyalist sentiments are promoted .  But religious education has been known to be fundamentalist and in some cases anti - catholic ,  depending on the teacher .  It is important to note that , since the system <head>began</head> in the late 1920s , there has never been a significant move to split up the schools for use by the separate denominations , something which would have been feasible in the larger towns . The Northern public - sector schools come from the partly voluntary system of pre - Partition .  In 1928 ,  these schools entered the system of maintained schools ,  whereby ,  in exchange for full payment of current costs and 65 per cent of capital expenditure ,  the former owners and managers ,  usually churches ,  were allowed two - thirds representation  on the local board of management ,  with the other third coming from the local authority .

Until recently ,  catholics in the North were practically forbidden by their clergy to attend state schools ,  exceptions being made in certain outlying areas .  Bishop Edward Daly in Derry liberally interpreted the needs of his Roman catholic pupils from the mid - 1970s ,  allowing greater freedom and seeing to it that some alternative religious education was provided .  At the same time , the late Bishop Philbin <head>began</head> to refuse the sacrament of Confirmation to Roman catholic children attending state schools . A number of clergy in his diocese refused religious instruction to these children .  The reason given was that children would not be religiously and  educationally prepared for the reception of Holy Communion and Confirmation because they had not been educated at a catholic school ,  irrespective of their parents '  alternative provisions :  in one area ,  parents had set up their own Sunday schools as an alternative .

There is of course no logical reason why things should be different this time ,  wrote Harsnet ,  why this too should not be an illusion ,  the illusion of imagining that I know not only what step to take first but also what step to take second and even what step to take third .

The system used in Britain to produce mild ,  bitter ,  stout and strong ales is called warm fermentation ,  using a special type of top fermenting yeast .  This means that the yeast ,  encouraged by the warmth of the wort and the temperature of the brewery ,  works quickly and vigorously on top of the wort to produce alcohol .  After 47 days most of the sugars have been turned into alcohol and the yeast <head>begins</head> to sink to the bottom of the vessel . The excess yeast is saved for future use .  So much yeast is produced during fermentation that large amounts are sold to companies such as Marmite to be turned into yeast extract .

She was rediscovered as a film - maker in the early 80 's  ,  and a series of retrospectives and tributes culminated in 1990 at the International Festival of Women 's  Films in Creteil ,  where a programme of her work was feted by capacity audiences .  Her first husband was Sydney Box ,  the writer - director who became head of production at Gainsborough Studios ;  and her sister - in - law was the Miss Box Office who produced the wildly successful DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE films over two decades .  But Muriel 's climb to film direction was slow and gradual , and she <head>began</head> her apprenticeship as a typist and then continuity girl , rising throughout the studio hierarchy . She wrote theatre plays ,  often for all women casts ,  which anticipated her work on Gainsborough films ,  with their dominant roles for women stars and strong appeal to women audiences .  After directing the Verity films ,  the company she and Sydney formed during the Second World War ,  she moved into independent feature production .

As I have read his writings , often in photocopies lent to me by friends , or in the book on his work published in 1982 , in India , I have not only come to appreciate his films in a more informed way , but I have also realized that his outlook on film - making is one which has <head>begun</head> to affect my own thinking .

Ghatak was a committed Marxist , who <head>began</head> his career working in a political theatre company . But his work is always marked by elements of his own life ,  culminating in his final film ,  JUKTKI TAKKO AR GAPPO ,  which is virtually a self - portrait ,  depicting his own problems with alcoholism .  Ghatak wanted to combine insights from Marxism with elements from India thought ,  as well as the work of Jung ,  with which he became increasingly fascinated .

A common mistake is to try to use lift on the way back instead of gliding on through it at a sensible speed .  This nearly always results in drifting further back without much gain of height and ending up in a worse situation than before .  If it <head>begins</head> to look doubtful that the site can be reached and the glider is down to 1,000 feet , it is time to select the best possible field within easy reach and to make a safe landing in it . If you glide back any lower ,  the choice of landing area becomes very limited ,  until finally there is no choice at all .  Be decisive .

Snaking Glider trailers can be stable or unstable ,  depending on the car and the trailer combination .  If a trailer <head>begins</head> to snake , the swinging often develops so quickly that within seconds there is no way of stopping it and avoiding going right off the road . Even a fairly stable trailer will start to swing if it overtakes or is overtaken by a large truck .  The pressure wave from an overtaking truck strikes the rear of the trailer first ,  setting up a swing .

Accidental stalls seldom happen when the glider is being flown straight ,  and most result in one wing stalling before the other ,  causing a wing - drop .  Incipient spins Any time that a wing <head>begins</head> to drop at a stall it is the beginning of a possible spin , but the spin can only develop if the wing is kept stalled and the glider is allowed to continue to yaw . In the UK there has been much discussion about teaching stall recoveries with a view to making it all easier for the beginner to understand and  remember .  It has been suggested that incipient is an unfamiliar word ,  that associating the stall with a spin might get the student worried ,  and that to simplify things we should only talk about stalls and spins .

Unless this is quickly controlled ,  in a few seconds the glider can be far too high above the towplane .  The effect is accentuated if the c.g .  is near the aft limit and ,  in some cases ,  it is doubtful whether there is sufficient elevator authority to stop the pitching once it has gone beyond the early stages .  The only safeguard is to maintain the correct position carefully and to release at once if the glider is <head>beginning</head> to get too high in relation to the towplane . A number of accidents and incidents have occurred with gliders such as the Olympia 463 ,  K6 and K18 ,  flown by relatively inexperienced pilots .  These machines have lower stick forces than most training two - seaters and are not generally fitted with a nose hook for aerotowing .

So ,  to be safe it would be wise to use it at any time flying above 10,000 feet .  There is a very real risk that even at 15,000 feet the pilot may become unconscious ,  or at least incapable ,  from the combination of cold and lack of oxygen .  If the flight gets really exciting , there is also the possibility the pilot will become so frightened that he will <head>begin</head> to hyperventilate , and this can bring on hypoxia and unconsciousness very quickly . Landing In ideal weather conditions a field landing should present no difficulties and even in poor visibility ,  with a known wind direction ,  the risks are acceptable .

If the philosophical discontinuity Foucault describes is truly occurring ,  then an inside or reflexive exploration of police practice should reveal the strength of these divisive classificatory techniques ,  for any binary separation of man by his contemporaries into the non - human categories suggested by Leach  ( 1982 )  is the very stuff of anthropology .  And if such a classificatory system is a major feature of the way the police control their fellow citizens ,  then it seems essential it should be identified ,  assessed ,  and described .  Foucault ( 1980 ) , like Thompson ( 1980 ) , asserts that the criminal justice system is increasingly becoming an arm of the state apparatus , with the institution of policing <head>beginning</head> to wield expanding socio - political power . In a liberal democracy this needs to be scrutinized constantly ,  and herein lies the first problem for the researcher .  For how can one really study a system of state control without acknowledging that such an activity itself is antithetical to  the direction of power ?

It is really one of the foundations of any executive power group that it maintains secrecy about its activities and avoids the possibility for its antagonists to subsume that power .  As Arendt  ( 1958 )  indicated ,  the more public a group ,  the less power it is likely to have .  Real power , she clearly demonstrates , <head>begins</head> where secrecy exists . It should come as no surprise ,  therefore ,  to find that detailed ethnography of police social practice is antithetical to the philosophies of control by which they operate .  Yet in a liberal democracy ,  such a declaration cannot easily be made ;  indeed the opposite must be proclaimed .

Sarsby ,   ( 1984 :  1301 )  echoing Cheater ,  points out that anthropologists have tended to study people whose values and life - styles are different ,  even in their own society seeking the unfamiliar at home as well as abroad .  An assumption remains inherent in the literature that anthropology is academically based ,  funded by some research organization ,  presented in seminar ,  taught to students ,  and then written up and published .  It exists largely as a product of the institutions of higher education ( Sarsby 1984 : 132 ) and has only recently <head>begun</head> to surface in policy and practice . As Okely  ( 1987 :  67 )  observes ,  the urge to create publications is not always as crucial to others as it is to the academic .  Indeed for those insiders living in Cheater 's  metaphorical front room  such as in the police  the need to obscure and seek a degree of anonymity from the analytic gaze can be described as a major principle in the preservation of power ,  ranking highly in the structures of significance .

They get far more than they bargain for .  ( Grillo 1980 :  3 )  In effect , the insider who reveals the structural formations of a system of power inverts that power and the revelation creates a situation where elements of anti - structure ( Turner 1969 , 1974 ) now present a version of how things might be constituted ; and what has been seen as solid reality <head>begins</head> to be identified as only one social possibility . In this observing participation ,  the thick description which Geertz  ( 1975 )  argued for comes hurtling at the ethnographer ,  so that the classic use of an anthropological informant is hardly necessary .  Rather it will be a case of the researcher finding a means of recording and sorting the mass of detail which continuously bombards him and presents him with the lateral possibilities which make the discipline potentially dangerous .

Silence continues to sustain the hegemony ,  and social change only occurs when irresistible and more powerful forces are brought to bear from outside  ( see Adams 1988 )  .  Furthermore ,  such pressures are limited ,  thus creating a situation where there has been hardly any research on the police compared with the large output of critical scholarship on industry , commerce , the civil service , the health service and education what little direct research there has been on the police has scarcely <head>begun</head> to ask such fundamental questions as what is the police force and what is it doing . This point  ( Wojtas 1982 )  occurs in a description of a new research centre for Police Studies at Strathclyde University ,  which is to ask whether anyone is doing research on the police ,  what degree of co - operation they have met and to encourage research by the police themselves .  Once again ,  however ,  defensiveness won the day and when the Strathclyde Centre circulated forces asking them to co - operate in the venture ,  a decision was taken to withhold co - operation and a circular went round to this effect ,  suggesting the existing Home Office funded PRSU  ( Police Research Services  Unit )  and the Home Office Research and Planning Unit were adequate for the needs of the service .

Such material clearly illustrates the new modes of thought we were developing .  Our new semantic understanding was therefore linked to the changing epiphenomena of dress ,  hair ,  clothing ,  and the other symbols of the body I have mentioned ;  but it was also manifest in an irrepressible need to reinterpret and question the social condition ,  for I had journeyed beyond the norms of the police system ,  where action to control is preferably a simple  matter of enforcing the rules and regulations as they stand .  Yet this move into anti - structure was merely <head>beginning</head> .

Blocking Kicks Of all the kicks used in competition the high roundhouse kick is perhaps the easiest to see ,  though there are ways of disguising this .

Then turn your hips behind a long reverse punch to hit the opponent square in the chest ,  just as his knee is rising to its full height .

However ,  all the time your shoulder leads ,  your centre - line is not facing the opponent ,  so you are vulnerable to a strong counter - attack .  Lean in behind the strike in order to get the maximum range ,  and raise your other hand as a guard .  Unfortunately , the cocking action that <head>begins</head> a back fist movement presents an unmistakable cue to the opponent . The punching elbow must be flexed before it can be extended fully ,  and any attempt to strike with a semi - extended arm is sure to fail because of the obvious weakness of the technique .  The question is ,  how do you disguise the elbow flexion ?

It follows that if you can deliver an effective and continuous attack ,  your chances of scoring are higher than when you throw a single technique .  When putting a combination together ,  take account of the distance you are from the opponent and whether this will alter as the combination progresses .  Thus , if you <head>begin</head> with a kick and land in a forward position , a second kick will be inadvisable unless the opponent has maintained a constant distance from you . Similarly ,  if you advance with a rapid sequence of punches ,  there is little point in throwing a kick unless the opponent has back - pedalled faster than you have advanced .  You may find that distance closes quickly during a combination sequence and you and your opponent end up facing each other within reverse punch range .

Chronic knee injury can be managed by means of leg extension exercises on a multigym .  This builds up the muscles which locate the knee joint ,  helping to stop it moving above and grinding up bits of cartilage .  If your training routine has played up a chronic injury , then apply a light pressure bandage to the knee before <head>beginning</head> the day 's competition . Bandage the knee in a slightly flexed position and allow plenty of turns ,  especially below the kneecap .  If the joint begins to give trouble late in the day and you have a chance of a placing ,  then consider reapplying the bandage ,  only this time slightly tighter .

He dreamed ,  each time ,  of his plantation in Jamaica  banana palms leafed like green fountains ,  bright orange papaws clustered at the top of their naked stems ,  a noise of surf quickened the air with its rustling freshness .

In an interview with Mark Paytress in 1988 Leonard stated that by the age of six he was already acquainted with rudimentary Judaism and recalled being deeply touched by the stirring language and imagery of the Bible  -  in English and Hebrew .  Each day after school he would wend his way to the synagogue for instruction in the sacred scriptures ,  the stories and history of his people ,  which reached its climax in 1946 ,  when Leonard was made A son of the law. All hell rules over the man who is angry , says the Talmud , and by September 1939 , when Leonard was <head>beginning</head> to come to terms with the thresholds of life 's reality , hell was ruling the world , or at least appeared to be . War had been declared ,  and the fate of Czechoslovakia ,  Austria and Poland was sealed ,  as it would be for several other countries .  It would be six years before that anger would begin to subside ,  six years of unspeakable anguish for those of Hebrew persuasion ,  when unbelievable monstrosities would be inflicted on them ,  by the end of which half of the world 's  Jewry had been murdered .

And so <head>began</head> this friendship of 35 years , between the older and the younger man ( Layton is 20 years senior to Leonard ) ; between the master and the apprentice . Whenever Layton had a promotional tour or appearance ,  a poetry reading or a workshop  ( poetry - reading in Canada predated Ginsberg 's  sensation with Howl that set in motion the beat - poetry style ,  despite Scobie arguing it as an influence on Leonard 's  background )  ,  he would take Leonard along ,  acquaint him with the nuts and bolts of the business and get him to read some of his own poetry .

Having registered ,  he set about ordering his life as he saw it developing ,  by giving himself over to the muse ,  by associating with those whose lives found proper space for literary reflection and endeavour ,  by getting close to that bohemian existence which he loved and from which all modern art seemed to spring .  Most of all ,  by writing poetry and seeking to enhance his skills at it .  The Quiet Revolution which was <head>beginning</head> to take place in Canada was now seizing Leonard himself ; he would be a poet - writer , and be would find a place for his music alongside it . And there was much encouragement around him to do so .  Layton 's  ebullience was on a par with Ezra Pound 's  showmanship ,  and Leonard now found himself not so very far from where the great revolutionary poet  ( of Imagism ,  Vortism etc. )  was actually incarcerated .

Like any form of art ,  music has an intrinsic ability to revitalise itself ;  but when this is stimulated by external factors ,  for example ,  those that become operative in the wake of the industrial revolution ,  the Darwinian ferment and the resurgence of nationalism in the 19th century ,  not least a species of war - mongering ,  then wholly new genres may emerge .  Such had happened in Scotland and Ireland in its employment of folk - themes for late 19th century classical music .  And in England in the shape of Cecil Sharp and company it too <head>began</head> to assert its own folk - music ( over Continental , largely Teutonic forms ) in the opening decades of the present century . Many of these had found their way across America and Canada with the early settlers ,  along with psalm versions and hymnody .  The wave of interest in the rediscovery of Celtic music is particularly important ,  and not merely because of the Celtic - Scottish influence on Leonard 's  family  ( an aspect that the  Montreal Gazette  highlighted regarding Lyon Cohen 's  Gaelic accent recently )  and American eclecticism  often little more than a slavish following of European forms  which found itself in the development of pop music ,  notably of ragtime around 1900 and jazz around 1918 .

Leonard was but 21 when it was first published ,  though the poems were culled from his output from 15 to 20 years of age ,  according to an interview he gave to Andrew Tyler of Disc  in 1972 .  It was not ,  however ,  the luxuriance of his style or language which his former mentor ,  Louis Dudek ,  focused on in 1958 ,  but the total negation ,  the high condition .  Professor Dudek , who had <head>begun</head> to express criticism rather than encouragement for the young poet , went on to speak of an intellectual disorder ( not only in politics , but in morality and religion ) which leads to a primitive mythological effort to organise chaos ( it ) proceeds from a state of mind fundamentally disturbed , and bordering on the deeply neurotic or worse . Mythological or not ,  it has to be emphasised that he was speaking here of a group of poets  Ellenborgen ,  Hine ,  Mandel ,  Purdy ,  Macpherson ,  Layton and Cohen  not just Leonard himself .  But he clearly places Leonard within this group which ,  he held ,  grasps at a confusion of symbolic images ,  often a ragbag of classical mythology ,  in the effort to organise a chaos too large for them to deal with in the light of reason ,  which in turn causes them to express a sardonic bitterness in their social criticism ,  a realism without any utopian idealism to support it .

But we should also note  ( as the critics largely did not )  the positive values he inculcates in such reflections ,  with which he concludes his piece :  Must we find all work prosaic ?  It is typical of him to assert ,  as Judaism does roundly ,  that all work is honourable ;  and deny that the reliance on special work and destiny  ( God 's  work )  elevates a man per se  .

In earlier work ,  he and others had established that the cortical - evoked potential ,  and also direct cortical stimulation ,  had to persist for several hundred milliseconds  before subjects reported feeling anything .  Then in the 1979 paper he found that subjects placed the time of occurrence of this sensation only a few milliseconds after the peripheral stimulus which evoked it .  So although the ERP had to persist for several hundred milliseconds before the subject felt anything , they nevertheless reported that the sensation had occurred at the moment when the ERP was <head>beginning</head> . Libet concluded from this that the subjective experience was occurring before the neural events which bought it about .  This apparently backward causality ,  if true ,  would cause problems for identity theories of mind and has been used by dualists like John Eccles to support their position ,  with the backward step in time made by a non - physical mind .

This apparently backward causality ,  if true ,  would cause problems for identity theories of mind and has been used by dualists like John Eccles to support their position ,  with the backward step in time made by a non - physical mind .  Libet 's  second set of experiments ,  described in 1985 ,  is even more striking .  About a second before a subject moves a part of his body , a slow negative shift in the electrical potential generated by the brain <head>begins</head> . This effect ,  which is strongest over the frontal lobes ,  was first observed in 1964 by Grey Walter ,  who called it the Contingent Negative Variation .  More recently ,  and perhaps begging the question of its mental significance ,  it has come to be known as the Readiness Potential  ( RP )  .

At the same time ,  Libet set up a procedure for allowing subjects to report the time at which they first experienced the conscious intention to act .  This was done by asking them to report the position of a dot moving round an oscilloscope screen at the moment of the experience .  Knowing the time the dot was in any particular position , Libet was able to calculate that on average the experience of the conscious intention to act was reported as beginning about 200 msec before the movement <head>began</head> . Subtracting these 200 msec from the 550 msec by which the RP preceded the movement ,  Libet concluded that the neural activity associated with an apparently voluntary act began some 350 msec before  the first moment at which the subject was aware of his intention to act .  So ,  he argued ,  the cerebral initiation of a spontaneous voluntary act begins unconsciously  ( Libet ,  1985 )  .

This was done by asking them to report the position of a dot moving round an oscilloscope screen at the moment of the experience .  Knowing the time the dot was in any particular position ,  Libet was able to calculate that on average the experience of the conscious intention to act was reported as beginning about 200 msec before the movement began .  Subtracting these 200 msec from the 550 msec by which the RP preceded the movement , Libet concluded that the neural activity associated with an apparently voluntary act <head>began</head> some 350 msec before the first moment at which the subject was aware of his intention to act . So ,  he argued ,  the cerebral initiation of a spontaneous voluntary act begins unconsciously  ( Libet ,  1985 )  .  If accepted ,  this somewhat paradoxical suggestion leaves the problem of finding a role for consciousness in voluntary acts .
