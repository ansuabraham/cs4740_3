It is possible for such sentiments of approval of this past to coexist with abhorrence for most current acts of violence .  But the political significance of this culture is that where opinion counts and where the catholic  nationalist remnant actually experiences the coercive power of protestant loyalists and the British army in the Northern statelet ,  there violence has all the more support .  When it does , it tends to be a reaction to perceived injustice , such as internment without trial , or the conviction of a son by a sole judge in a trial held in total secrecy and on the evidence of unseen witnesses , or a simple case of one 's house being badly mauled by careless soldiers searching for <head>arms</head> . This reactive violence is thus justified by its subjects and the justification subsists  in consciousness along with their Roman catholic profession of faith and identity .  The provisional IRA 's  commitment to violence against the British and against the protestant  loyalist alliance ,  which the provisionals rhetorically and conveniently subsume under the term the British ,  is frequently assumed to be based on either Marxist or nationalist principles and in both cases to be secularist or areligious .

It is important to practise adjusting the airbrakes during the float and to kick yourself hard if you ever land short of your point with brake still applied .  It simply means that you have frozen on the airbrake lever and have undershot when you could have saved the situation .  This is the same as throttle <head>arm</head> paralysis on a powered aircraft when the pilot undershoots and crashes his aircraft . He could have pushed the throttle forwards and avoided the accident by using the engine .  It is also worthwhile attempting the occasional no airbrake touch down to get a better idea of how far your glider will float .

In their own research departments the police continuously attempt to measure aspects of their activity ,  largely to demonstrate cost effectiveness in line with criteria imposed by the limits on public spending  ( HO Circular 114/83 )  and the prevalent socio - economic world view of society .  This has meant that many studies tend to concentrate on the objective assessment of a fiscally quantifiable reality .  For example , the Audit Commission ( an <head>arm</head> of the treasury ) spent some time in 1987/8 with myself and others in a police research department assessing an OSU ( Operational Support Unit ) administrative system which they claimed had revolutionized police decision making and released manpower for patrol equal to 6.358 million . However ,  a colleague looking at these OSUs in relation to their cultural impact ,  saw there were many aspects of a qualitative nature which could not easily be expressed in fiscal terms  ( Adams 1988 :  11 )  :  direct submission of reports to the 0 .

If he extends his <head>arms</head> with the fingers together it is an award . Finally ,  if the referee brings both fists together in the middle of the chest ,  this means that both contestants scored at the same time ,  so no awards will be made .

Even during flurries of techniques ,  both hands remain on their respective sides of the centre - line .  Arm movement Economy of <head>arm</head> movement is important since the more you flail them about , the longer it takes to cock them for an effective punch . Move your arms as little as is necessary to achieve your purpose ,  and always move them together so that if the front hand is knocking down an incoming punch ,  the rear is executing a counter - punch .  You simply do not have the time for the one  pause  two sequences so beloved in basic training .

Follow the opponent 's  shape ,  not his attacking limb ,  because although an individual technique may have been successfully evaded ,  the opponent still remains potentially dangerous .

The third example uses a short but wide diagonal movement of the front foot to take you clear of the opponent 's  incoming reverse punch .  Use a long ,  thrusting snap punch to the opponent 's  face and if the chance presents itself ,  follow up quickly with a reverse punch .  If the opponent 's attack is a face punch , then hit his extended <head>arm</head> with your forearm , glancing your punch over the top of his and into the target .

The second requirement is that of good timing .  Some competitors just are n't quick enough off the mark ,  or they hold back instead of thrusting in strongly .  Either of these faults means that the attacking technique is well developed before you move into it , and so your front barring <head>arm</head> or groin suffer accordingly . Move directly into a high roundhouse kick and stop - punch it Stop a front kick by barring down with your leading guard whilst reverse - punching to the opponent 's  chest

To do this you slide back your rear foot so that the stance lengthens  ( this makes it more stable in a longitudinal direction )  and your centre of gravity drops .  If the action is sharp enough your opponent 's  punch will graze over the top of your head ,  helped on its way by a fast rising block .  As well as dealing with the punch , the rising block travels diagonally up and forwards into the opponent , catching him high on the attacking <head>arm</head> . Do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring your chin close to the opponent 's  other fist .  There is no need to withdraw your blocking arm fully as you reverse punch ;  you probably wo n't have enough time to anyway !

Even if the slide is not feasible ,  you can still throw your centre of gravity forward ,  so that weight increases on the leading leg .  The fifth attention - grabber is the exaggerated hip action which should accompany every punch .  This shows that the punch is not merely an <head>arm</head> movement , but a powerful , co - ordinated body action . The punching hip ,  be it the leading hip of a front punch or the trailing hip of a reverse punch ,  must swivel forwards ,  so that your centre - line directly faces the opponent .  You may well decide to twist even further when using the front punch ,  but beware that your situation is weakened should the opponent immediately counter  attack .

The back fist This punch is not a linear strike like the previous two but a circular one .  The back fist unrolls from the shoulder , propelled as much by the body turning away as by the <head>arm</head> action itself . Many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the arm action .  A back fist will out - range a reverse punch performed by an opponent of equal height but it is not often scored because many referees do not consider it powerful enough .

Lean in behind the strike in order to get the maximum range ,  and raise your other hand as a guard .  Unfortunately ,  the cocking action that begins a back fist movement presents an unmistakable cue to the opponent .  The punching elbow must be flexed before it can be extended fully , and any attempt to strike with a semi - extended <head>arm</head> is sure to fail because of the obvious weakness of the technique . The question is ,  how do you disguise the elbow flexion ?  One answer is to open with a reverse punch to the mid - section .

Also ,  the opponent may fall in an unexpected direction ,  so that you have to spin around and perhaps take a step to reach him. By that time ,  of course ,  the element of surprise is lost and his guard is ready and waiting .  The remainder of the sequence then degenerates into a mle of pumping <head>arms</head> and legs .

The little army was stirring to its feet ,  movement ran from front to back of the broad crowd like hackles rising .  Let me see your hands .  Hundreds of <head>arms</head> were standing up stiffly now like bristling branches . Let us bind ourselves now by this oath  say it with me .  We do swear  He paused ,  and a murmur followed him with some clearer ,  harsher voices audible amongst it :  We do swear  He went on :  Never to swerve ,  and they said it together ,  Never to swerve  from our present path  till we have cleansed the country  or this oppressive Act .

They tramped along to Ballechin among the ferns and sheltering oaks ,  smelling the cheesey smell of cows among the mist .  Hope Steuart had felled a tree across the track ,  two men with cudgels were standing sentry behind it ,  they dropped the clubs and ran when the whole wood came at them ,  the darkness between the trees turned into people ,  people everywhere ,  herds and thickets of them surrounding the low tower - house .  Hope Steuart had leaned two loaded muskets against the doorjambs ; he turned to pick one up but the Duke 's two sons were on him , twisting his <head>arms</head> behind him. He struggled and roared out ,  I see you ,  James Menzies ,  I charge you with sedition ,  and the Duke roared back ,  We charge you  with tyranny ,  trail him round the house ,   lads ,  show his servants who is the master now .  They carted him like a scarecrow ,  his heels scoring the gravel ,  but he was as stubborn as a pig in a cart ,  he would never squeal without a hard prod ;  Donald Stewart the blacksmith had to grip his wrist to make him sign the paper .

The main function of pecs is to adduct the <head>arms</head> ( adduction is a movement towards the centre - line of the body ) , that is they move the upper <head>arms</head> across the body as in dumb - bell flyes . Other movements brought about by the pecs are shoulder flexion ,  which draws the arm forwards and upwards ,  and shoulder extension ,  which draws the arm down and forwards .  By working the pecs from different angles it is possible to direct the work - load to different parts of the muscle .

The heads form a cap which covers the shoulder joint , and they are attached at one end to the upper <head>arm</head> and at the other end to 3 points to the front , top and back of the shoulder . The function of the deltoids is to raise the arm to the front ,  the side and the rear .

At risk of seeming a killjoy ,  I would urge readers to think through the implications of all home - made safety devices which set out to resolve some well - acknowledged safety problem only to create others of a less obvious by more hazardous nature .  Remembering that anything that bodes to threaten concentration in wood - machining is a prime risk ,  let us consider a router cutter revolving at anything up to 24,000rpm sitting midway between 12 highly unstably - sprung devices whose proper purpose in life is the support of wet laundry on a clothes line .  It takes little imagination to foretell the likely consequences of just one peg disintegrating and flinging its spring or its free <head>arm</head> into the cutter gap during a pass ; or the possible knock - on effect ( s ) on the rest of the makeshift assembly and the astonished operator if this should happen . There have been better hold - down devices of a home - made nature in Woodworker  in the past  the best of them doubtless designed after some careful thoughts about an acceptable specification .  Mr Wiseman does n't only have the safety of his hands to consider :  in this case he might stand to lose his sight or sustain laceration from bits of flying clothespegs ,  blocks and cramps into the bargain .

In following Stravinsky 's  guidelines ,  Ashton found many new ,  sometimes frivolous ,  ways of performing class - room steps .  The corps de ballet  neglect the turn - out and step forwards sur les pointes  ,  raising the working knee and resting the toe on the calf of the other leg ,  before moving forwards .  They travel forwards instead of en place in chapp relevs after breaking the rule that the <head>arms</head> never cross the centre line of the body and are always ( except in arabesque ) rounded . If Ashton 's  Scnes de Ballet  is compared with Balanchine 's  Ballet Imperial  ,  it will be seen that Balanchine rarely breaks away from the classical technique as practised in petipa 's  day when Tchaikovsky wrote the music .  Ashton ,  like Stravinsky ,  took into account the technical developments which had taken place .

In Symphonic  Variations  ,  the dancers perform pas de bourre piqus sur les pointes  very gently because they are marking the rhythmic beat as the soloist dances to the melodic phrase .  This is an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythms are explicitly brought to life by the dance design  ( see page 68 )  .  One of the most beautiful uses of pas de bourre courus is when Ashton places his danseuse in her partner 's <head>arms</head> as she floats over the surface of the floor as if in a dream like ecstasy . It is a movement he has used many times and which is perhaps seen at its best in the pas de deux  to the Meditation  from Thai - s  created for Anthony Dowell and Antoinette Sibley ;  in A Month in the Country  when Natalia dances with the Tutor to express her emotions ;  and in Les Deux Pigeons  in the final pas de deux  ,  when the Young Man has returned to The Girl and tenderly dances with her in his arms  ( see page 83 )  .  It was this ability to display a ballerina 's  apparent weightlessness and sheer joy in dance that was so impressive when the Spirits of the Air danced in Homage to the  Queen  ,  Ashton 's  exquisite celebration of the 1952 Coronation which was danced by Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes .

But such jumps can also travel some way forwards ,  backwards or sideways and can become sparklingly light when the knees are sharply bent upwards at the height of the jump .  This is required of the Four Fairies ,  the Fairy Godmother and the Stars in Ashton 's  Cinderella  .  However if this way of jumping from two feet to two feet had not been combined with well picked - up pas de bourre piqus and relevs retirs as well as extremely accurate , quick ports de bras with straighter and more angled than rounded <head>arms</head> , they would have seemed out of place . When moving dancers from two feet to one in both open and closed sissonnes  ,  the choreographer can make the movements dart over the floor as Aurora does in her final solo in The Sleeping Beauty  .  In Les Patineurs  and Les Rendezvous  Ashton makes his dancers travel upwards as well in an effort to show off their abilities to keep up with the music and beat each other to the exit .

It can be that magic moment in such dances as the Rose Adage in The  Sleeping Beauty  when Aurora triumphantly raises her hand from the fourth Prince 's  grasp and holds the final attitude  for several seconds revealing her complete command over the forces of gravity .  There are hundreds of instances of this kind of pose created by many different choreographers .  There is the moment in the Act II pas de deux or Swan Lake where Odette appears to fly away in an arabesque before Siegfried seizes her <head>arms</head> and draws her body close to his in an embrace . There are also the exciting poses that come at the end of some of Ashton 's  pas de deux  as the two characters declare their love ,  for example ,  when Oberon cradles Titania in his arms at the end of The Dream  and ,  even more excitingly ,  when Colas lifts Lise high on one arm it the end of their dance in Act II of La Fille Mai Garde  as if to crown her queen of the harvest In some modern classical ballets too little attention is paid to the momentary holding of a pose as the focus of a picture to sum up  as it were  what has gone before .

For example  :  in Choros  he focuses attention on many ancient Greek dance rituals and accents the playful use of movement whilst at the same time showing that such warlike ,  athletic courtship and other activities are a wonderful game to be played by the performers .  In Consort Lessons  these quick changes of aulement  give much greater variety and dimension to the overall design particularly where the solo girl dances with four boys .  More recently , in his The Sons of Horus he has found ways of incorporating the profiled attitudes and poses seen in ancient Egyptian designs with straight turned - in legs , elongated lines and angled <head>arms</head> , all in contrast to the turnedout legs and curving bodies of classical dance . As Ashton and MacMillan in many of their ballets ,  he has created a style appropriate to one particular ballet .

Petipa 's  remark that without ports de bras  the dancer is dumb is only one of the wise comments he made when working on his choreographic designs .  Fokine echoed this remark when he said every step and pose is a gesture  ( see page 58 )  .  De Valois summed up the ideas of these two great choreographers by saying : Only synchronisation of <head>arms</head> and legs will give symmetry to step and pose , strength to the jump , speed to the pirouettes , calm to the adage and spaciousness to the dance . To ensure that his audience would appreciate each sentence in his dance ,  petipa usually repeated each at least twice and usually four times .  But towards the end of the second or fourth repeat he made some small alteration in the ports de bras  so that the dancer could move easily into the next sentence .

This is particularly noticeable in his variations for the Six fairies in The Sleeping Beauty  .  Petipa clearly reflects in dance the gift that each fairy brings to the Christening .  The first Fairy is slow and gracious to denote Beauty ; she encircles her face with her hand and displays the line of her <head>arm</head> ( the traditional gesture for beauty ) . The Second Fairy brings Grace and dances slightly faster in such a way that she shows off the lines of her body as it faces forwards and then backwards  ( the traditional gesture )  .  The Third Fairy dances slowly sur les pointes  and uses conventional hand movements to show she brings the gift of Plenty ,  just as the godmother at a Russian christening scatters breadcrumbs over the cradle .

But if Ashton had not made these very distinctive changes in his ports de bras  ,  the seasonal differences would not have been so notable .  The above examples are only a few of those showing how conventional ports de  bras  can be changed .  A study of Ashton 's ways of using them , or of MacMillan 's , reveal how unnecessary it is to keep passing the <head>arms</head> through 1st position . Nor is it necessary always to keep the arms rounded except in arabesque  .  Examples taken from both choreographers '  works describe the particular feelings ,  moods and emotions of the characters their dancers are portraying .

The demi - caractre  style has its roots in classical technique ,  but must be coloured by more clearly defined and individual movements which allow the dancers to show they are playing the part of some character who has some claim to live in the real world and therefore can be recognised as such .  In other words they usually ,  dance classically from their feet to the waist and above that are free to express themselves as people of more definite behaviour ,  work ,  play and age  ( de Valois in a lecture to teachers ,  1947 )  .  The head , body and <head>arms</head> of the characters portrayed should show the status they have in the society to which they belong whether it is rural , urban or fantastic , as well as their behaviour , customs , work or play . Dauberval 's  La Fille Mal Gard   ( 1789 )  was the first ballet in this style .  Dauberval 's  exclusion from the Acadmie Royale  ( later the Paris Opera )  was justified by those in charge because they felt his idea of making farmers ,  peasants and the like the heroes and heroines of his ballets was beneath the dignity of an opera house whose stage had hitherto been occupied with the deeds of noble heroes ,  heroines and courts .

Bournonville coloured his ballets with movements characteristic of many different personalities and nationalities .  In his particular style of demi - caractre dance he used classical footwork for most of the time but , from the waist upwards through the body , <head>arms</head> and head , he tried to convey how his performers worked and played in the environment to which they belonged . for example :  in Napoli  they were Italian ,  in Far from Denmark  they were Danes influenced by the dance of South America .  This way of creating more plebeian characters is fully demonstrated in Ashton 's  comic masterpiece La Fille Mal Garde  ,  where this style of dance is shown in two different aspects ,  the light - hearted yet technically highly expert dancing of Lise and Colas and the comically eccentric work of Alain and the Cock and Hens .

As traditional Italian dances are often sung ,  the performers pose solemnly fur a second or two at the end of each phrase .  This was a feature widely used by nineteenth - century Italian balletmasters and by Bournonville .  But the latter 's pause was often to hold the dancers in perfect 5th positions of both <head>arms</head> and feet . Spanish style  The stereotyped Spanish style is possibly seen at its best in Petipa 's  Don Quixote  ,  most particularly in the famous pas de deux  fur the ballerina and her partner .

Spanish style  The stereotyped Spanish style is possibly seen at its best in Petipa 's  Don Quixote  ,  most particularly in the famous pas de deux  fur the ballerina and her partner .  The tone is set by the continual use of the pose with head held high , back slightly arched , <head>arms</head> in closed 4th or a stretch fully upwards in 5th sur les pointes for Kitri or on demi - pointes for Basil . The brilliant bravura variation when Kitri springs lightly forwards sur les  pointes  whilst fanning herself and Basil attempts to make his zapateado  ( heel - tapping )  appear authentic by the slightly crouching pose of his body ,  add even greater panache to their efforts .  Swanhilda strikes similar poses with her mantilla and fan in Copplia  and so do the Spanish dancers in Swan Lake  .

The working leg is thrust outwards on the first beat of a bar ,  heels click and stamp to accent the appropriate beats .  Although the solo danseuses  perform sur les pointes  ,  they still mark the appropriate beats by stabbing their toes into the floor ,  i.e. they dance a series of retirs passs  forwards or backwards without descending and use typical Hungarian ports de bras  .  These are also strongly accented as the <head>arms</head> straighten into 2nd position before being bent , with hands sometimes clasped behind the head , sometimes placed akimbo on the waist or sometimes with one on the waist and the other behind the large bow at the back of the head - dress . The danseuses  perform some of the traditional steps such as the sideways moving pas de bourre  danced sur les pointes  and the sideways cabrioie  rarely used in classical ballet .   The unusual feature of traditional Hungarian style is the strong distinction made between the two parts of most folk dances .

This made the dancers appear as if they were a moving frieze .  Something that David Bintley was also to achieve later in his Sons of Horus   ( 1985 )  .  Ashton too has created two oriental styled ballets in which the delicacy of the hands and <head>arms</head> drew attention to the way such subtle movements can take the place of words . His interest in ports de bras  nearly always produces something new to say ,  whether it is to tell a story ,  describe the characters and/or create a style exclusive to one work .  Japanese  The first of Ashton 's  ballets in oriental style was Madame Chrysanthme  ,  in which he utilised many traditional japanese gestures made more fascinating by emphasis of his dainty ballerina 's  footwork .

The latter 's  vicious slap on the child 's  face explains more than any other gesture Natalia 's  selfishness .

Ashton 's careful build - up to this climax makes Vera 's discovery of them in each other 's <head>arms</head> all the more poignant because she shows a child - like petulance at losing one she so longed to have for her own . It is so unlike Natalia 's  reaction when finding the Tutor and Vera together .

If choreographers study the above works of Ashton and MacMillan ,  they will understand how far the art of choreography has developed since Fokine changed its structure and texture .  They will perhaps understand even better if they pay particular attention to the fine details of every movement .  It is no longer the case that the romantic style means dancing classically from the feet to the waist and above that allowing the body , <head>arms</head> and head to express themselves to describe the moods , emotions and actions of the characters . It is well known that only a great dancer - artist can suggest the development of the sixteen - year - old Aurora ,  happy at her birthday ,  into the dreamy figure the Prince meets in the woodland glade and on to her final entrance as a triumphant princess fully awake to her responsibilities as Queen - to - be .  The enchanements  she dances  thoughout  the three scenes do not change in style or content .

Yet if the dances of Vera and Natalia in A Month in the Country  and Juliet in Romeo and Juliet  are examined it will be discovered how the technical content is so designed that the steps ,  poses and gestures show how changing circumstances are affecting the individuals .  This is what Perrot first attempted with his five leitmotifs for Giselle   ( see page 61 )  .  Continual development in the choreographic design is very obvious in the quiver of the raised leg as the Tutor takes Natalia in his <head>arms</head> . It shows her growing emotional involvement and gradually seems to affect her every movement .  This same tiny movement also appears when Vera begins to dance with the Tutor ,  but her movement is not so intense .

Juliet then becomes the slightly apprehensive debutante at the Ball where her movements ,  though tentative ,   are conventionally correct when she dances with Paris .  The moment she encounters Romeo and senses somehow that her life has changed her movement becomes more purposeful .  From there onwards it becomes stronger and more emotional so that her joyous movements and later abandon in Romeo 's <head>arms</head> are in absolute contrast to her later dance with Paris . Her movements then are equally purposeful but they are constricted and withdrawn ,  so that her father 's  contemptuous rejection of her pleas and his throwing her to the floor seem the proper outcome of what in his eyes is sheer disobedience .  It is her final passionate abandon on discovering Romeo 's  body that demonstrates how overwhelming sorrow can destroy all sense of discipline over both body and mind .

The movements are more or less directed sideways ,  i.e. cart  or effac  ,  as in the dances fur Romeo ,  Mercutio and Benvolio in Romeo and Juliet  and fur the Tutor in A Month in the Country  .  4 Sideways closed  (  crois  )  If the character moves sideways with the head , body and <head>arms</head> in some way averted from the front , i.e. crois , possibly with a twist of the shoulders , he or she is usually playing some evil or cunning person .

Bodies should be fully stretched upwards and curved either slightly forwards or backwards from the waist only .  This stance must be accompanied by the wellrecognised ports de bras  ,  which must be accurately co - ordinated with the footwork .  The <head>arms</head> usually change after each brief enchanement . Their movement also depends upon which foot is in front .  If the right foot remains there for several bars ,  the arms will be held still ,  but as soon as the left moves in front the arms will change .

By so phrasing each paragraph and bringing each incident to a proper conclusion ,  Nijinska gives both dancers and audience time to consider what has been done and what is yet to happen .  The nature of the formal shapes made by the dancers '  bodies and limbs as they move into and hold a picture must be evaluated .  Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints , thus the dancers ' bodies mostly face the audience but their <head>arms</head> and legs turn inwards and are seen mostly in profile . The angles made at the elbows ,  shoulders ,  knees and ankle joints are clearly visible .  Those of the arms are particularly interesting because the fists are either clenched or the fingers flattened thus the lines and shapes made only appear slightly rounded by the folds in the sleeves .

Technical characteristics It is the very particular choreographic style that MacMillan created for the child - like figure in Requiem  that emphasises more strongly than any other of today 's  ballets the need for choreographers to explore dance itself .  Only when they have examined what hands , <head>arms</head> , legs and feet , body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story , theme or music , can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture , with the right quality , mood , emotion , action and character . The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and ,  when needed ,  help to create the atmosphere and mood of the whole .  Choreographers must then decide how many and which details they need to add to disclose the particular features of the story ,  theme and/or music that they wish to communicate .

As a young doctor in Leiden he paid a seminal visit to the neuroanatomist WJH Nauta ,  at that time developing a revolutionary anatomical technique for investigating the nervous system by staining degenerating fibres cut off from their parent cell - bodies .  Kuypers was the first to use this technique in studies of the brain and over the next 10 years ,  now in the United States ,  he charted at a new level of detail the connections made by the cerebral cortex with nervous elements in the brain - stem and spinal cord that control movement in a number of higher mammals .  Kuypers then started a long series of collaborative studies in which injuries to some of these connections in the monkey 's brain were correlated with the defects they produced in performance of movements ; the poising of an <head>arm</head> , for instance , to carry out an operation with the fingers could be dissociated from the ability to use the fingers skilfully . These studies continued ,  with increasing sophistication ,  after his return to Europe in 1966 as Professor of Anatomy at the new Erasmus University in Rotterdam .  He showed that injury to connections within the cerebral cortex could cause the dissociation of hand movements guided by vision from those guided by touch .

As I 've said before directly to the Labour Party ,  You must make up your minds .  Do you want to talk about disarmament or do you want to help those in the White House and in the Kremlin who are really trying to do something effective about it ?  The only way in which we can help is having a Labour government that has a policy to secure verifiable <head>arms</head> reductions . That 's  our policy .  We 're looking forward to the opportunity of helping .

The former king condemns the Kabul regime with the same tone he used when the Soviet troops were in Afghanistan and has also refused to endorse the mujahedin interim government in Peshawar .  President Najibullah has been helped since the Soviet withdrawal by a a revival of Afghan nationalism ,  which his government has cleverly exploited to present the mujahedin as foreign - backed invaders .  His government has had considerable success in winning over guerrilla field commanders and turning them into semi - autonomous militias with lavish handouts of money and <head>arms</head> . The secret of our success lies in these militias ,  said President Najibullah .  Morale is high ,  especially after the mujahedin failed to capture Jalalabad as they said they would .

And if there is still no president when the current assembly session expires in December 1990 ,  the very mechanism that is intended to ensure the continuation of the Lebanese state will cease to exist .  The unhappy truth is that foreign armies have been marching backwards and forwards across Lebanon for hundreds of years .  Weapons have flooded into the country since the 1860s when the Royal Navy delivered <head>arms</head> to the Druze . Syria is still supplying guns to the Muslims ,  just as Iraq is supplying guns to the Christians .  It is the task of Lakhdar Ibrahimi ,  the Arab League envoy ,  to struggle through a tangle of sub - issues in the hope that he can persuade the Lebanese to renegotiate France 's  political legacy and the policies that began when General Henri Gouraud ,  who became the French high commissioner of Lebanon in 1920 ,  stepped ashore .

And ,  as Mao 's  reputation slipped ,  so too did Chen 's  .  In 1966 ,  however ,  when Mao began his dramatic bid for absolute power ,  using young Red Guards to discredit and persecute his old rivals within the party ,  Chen again rose to the occasion ,  acting as a mouthpiece for Mao 's  increasingly scrambled thoughts and policies .  Chen is even said to have written , or at least supervised at Mao 's behest , the Cultural Revolution 's best - known tract an hysterical call to <head>arms</head> against counter - revolutionaries printed in the People 's Daily in April 1966 under the title Sweep away all ghosts and monsters . To carry out a wholesale purge of the party apparatus ,  Mao appointed Chen as head of the Cultural Revolution Group ,  a kitchen cabinet of loyal disciples ,  including Mao 's  wife Jiang Qing ,  that was to lead the assault on the party hierarchy .  The group was finally disbanded in 1969 ,  by which time China had been plunged into virtual anarchy and economic collapse .

Police tried to pull away refugees climbing over the embassy 's  back fence last night ,  but they moved aside when the West German ambassador ,  Hermann Huber ,  appeared in the garden and said :  Let them go !  Members of a group attempting to reach the embassy the night before said policemen had hit them with rubber truncheons and turned them back .  As dawn broke yesterday , the same group , this time led by a mother with a baby in <head>arms</head> , faced down the police patrols and reached the embassy successfully . On Sunday West Germany had complained about the police presence around its embassy ,  and the slackening of restrictions is thought to have reflected an apparent Czechoslovak desire to remain as far as possible on good terms with both Germanies .  West Germany has so far denied ,  although with a detectable degree of ambiguity ,  that any deal was made ,  preferring to point to the humanitarian reasons for allowing an evacuation of the embassy ,  and the pressure supposedly exerted on East Germany by the Soviet Union to bring the occupation to a speedy end .

He does n't prove by feat of <head>arms</head> , but by words , that he is not any more the dissipated boy that he was ; but that is enough . He finds a way of talking about England ,  about right ,  about courage as a sort of secular sainthood ,  and it is his words ,  acting on his army ,  that bring France down. The French messenger Mountjoy ,  bringing an insult from the Dauphin ,  is met with a fierce defiance that leaves him ,  in this version ,  visibly shocked .

If Mr Gorbachev believed he could acquire a breathing space through repression ,  during which the economy could be transformed by unpopular but necessary reforms ,  he might be willing to pay the price ,  but this would reverse his strategy of the past three years .  In this period he came to believe that ,  to be effective ,  economic reforms must be accompanied by political liberalisation .  To crush strikes and abandon political reform would be to throw himself into the <head>arms</head> of those groups wedded not just to authoritarian politics but to neo - Stalinist economic institutions and principles . At which point Mr Gorbachev 's  strategy of turning the USSR into a prosperous society in which intelligent Russians can take pride will be doomed .

Although the Royal Ballet has acquired a certain Russian expansiveness for this production ,  Kirov - trained Asylnuratova simply recasts the ballet with the fierce lucidity of her movement .

Other Nikiyas Durante or Guillem may for instance assume a charming Oriental fluidity in their <head>arms</head> , but only Asylnuratova 's urgency and amplitude of gesture can convey the destructive extremes of Nikiya 's nature . Only she can phrase her movement so that its rhythm speaks so legibly of high spirits or despair .  And if Asylnuratova does not possess the imperturbable technique of a Guillem ,  the expressiveness of her dancing is matched by so mobile and luminous a face that everyone else on stage looks slightly blank .

So heavy and cumbersome is the hardtop ,  which fails to turn the Stag into a refined fixed - head coupe because of atrocious wind whoosh ,  that many have succumbed to rust while lying neglected in the garden ,  incubating snails .

Today England ,  having demolished a Railways XI containing no opposition of any note ,  take on a team sponsored by Air India ,  which looks almost as weak .  The locals field one former Test player ,  Madan Lal ,  and although Maninder Singh  last seen being swept to oblivion by Gooch in the Bombay World Cup semi - final  was practising at the England net yesterday ,  he has yet to come to terms with an attack of the yips .  It is a problem which seems curiously common to left - <head>arm</head> spinners , and manifests itself with the bowler either failing to release the ball , or propelling it vertically into the air . It finished  ( as a bowler )  the former Derbyshire player ,  Fred Swarbrook ,  who gave up the unequal struggle when ,  peering frantically around to see where a delivery had gone ,  he found out only when the ball dropped out of the stratosphere and hit him on top of the head .

There are 550 traditional off - licences carrying the basic Thresher range and 450 wine shops moving away from cigarettes and brands to concentrate on wine .  A slow ,  almost imperceptible evolution is already taking place in the high street .  Apart from Unwins and Davisons , both independent , and Oddbins , wine <head>arm</head> of the giant Canadian whisky corporation Seagram , the major high - street chains are concentrated in the hands of big brewers : Whitbread ( Thresher ) , Allied - Lyons ( Victoria Wine ) , Grand Metropolitan/Watneys ( Peter Dominic ) and Bass ( Augustus Barnett ) . This set - up helps to explain why the high - street off - licences  ( bar Oddbins )  ,  with blinkered attention to their brands ,  missed the Eighties wine retailing boom .  The legacy is all too clear .

The Army ordered sentries to wear flak jackets and constructed many sandbagged emplacements ,  although most barracks were still protected by little more than chain link fences .  The IRA did not choose to attack again until March 1987 .  A possible reason is that it was difficult to get <head>arms</head> and ammunition to the right place , despite the virtual absence of border controls between Germany and its western neighbours . Communication with an active service unit  two to 10 terrorists  far from Ireland was a further obstacle .  Another reason could be that the IRA had become aware of British intelligence 's  drive for informers .

He added :  I was never engaged either in supplying or use of explosives or arms .  That was never part of my business or intention .  At no time did I supply money for <head>arms</head> . Asked if he intended resuming his duties with the Pallotine order ,  the Catholic missionary body he joined in 1954 ,  he said his position had not yet been clarified .  Eamon O'Neill ,  Mr Ryan 's  agent in the June European elections ,  chaired the meeting .

Mr Ryan also admitted buying hundreds of Swiss memopark timing devices in the 1970s .  The devices are designed for parking meters ,  but are also the main timers used in IRA bombs .  The programme alleged that an electronic device bought by Mr Ryan was found in bomb - making circuitry in an IRA <head>arms</head> cache discovered in Salcey Forest , on the Northamptonshire - Buckinghamshire border , in 1984 . Identical circuitry was used in the 1982 Hyde Park bomb which killed eight people and injured fifty - three others .  Untransmitted tapes of the interview with Mr Ryan were handed over by Thames to Scotland Yard under the Prevention of Terrorism  ( Temporary Provisions )  Act 1989 .

With respect to the latter ,  for example ,  women are no longer excluded from night duty and they perform a wider range of section duties than before .  However ,  ordinary policewomen tend to feel that there are constraints upon equal opportunities within the force .  Some of these are official , in that senior managers do not allow policewomen to carry <head>arms</head> , from which follows some restrictions on where policewomen cam be stationed , and on their involvement in high - profile political policing , such as at riots . Most of the constraints ,  however ,  are informal .  With relatively so few policewomen ,  the occupational culture of the force is heavily masculine ,  and the wider cultural values that exist in Northern Ireland generally make men more conservative in their attitudes towards gender and sex roles .

It 's  awful ,  but that 's  the way your mind works Like ,  I know guys who lost arms and legs See , now I deliberately sit , when I 'm out in a Land Rover , with one <head>arm</head> up a bit higher than the other and one leg a bit higher . Like ,  I suppose that way if I was hit I might stand a chance of only losing one arm or one leg .  ( FN 15/5/1987 ,  p. 1516 )

( FN 15/5/1987 ,  p. 1516 )  As intimated ,  the danger of attack means that two neighbourhood men walking their beat are accompanied by at least sixteen soldiers ,  sometimes also by another squad of soldiers providing cover for those who are protecting the police ,  by two or more Land Rovers from the British Army and the RUC ,  and an Army helicopter .

I lay there for what seemed like an eternity and feeling in a sort of panic .  Was I wounded ?  Had I lost an <head>arm</head> or leg ? I was now able to breathe properly and started to feel over my body with both hands .  I was all right .

As I entered the barn someone handed me a mess - tin full of hot tea .  I sat down on the straw and looked around .  A few feet away two medics were lying stretched out on the floor of the barn , one lying face down , his <head>arms</head> by his sides , he appeared to be dead . No ,  they are not dead ,  Piper .  The poor bastards are exhausted !

As I lay in the ditch I was suddenly conscious of a very strong indescribably sickly smell .  Raising myself on one hand to peer over the ditch before clambering out onto the road ,  my hand and forearm suddenly went through the soft earth up to the elbow .  As I pulled my <head>arm</head> out there was a rush of foul - smelling air ; my hand and <head>arm</head> covered with a green and black substance . I felt a strong feeling of nausea as I realised that I had put my hand through the chest of a dead British soldier that could have been lying in the ditch for several days. The body had been covered by a thin layer of soil as was the practice when a soldier was killed in action and there was no time to move him to the rear .
