Some crates were as big as vacation cottages ,  because a hierarchy of crate status had suddenly come into being .  The richer the people ,  the bigger the crates they erected .  Crates belonging to millionaires were impressive : beamed and lined with sailcloth , they had <head>solid</head> , elegant walls made of the most expensive grades of tropical wood , with the rings and knots cut and polished like antiques . The passage takes off thereafter in ecstatic inventory .  At the start of the book there are false notes ,  those of a Hemingway war correspondent :  Every knock at the door could mean the end for me .

Tony Deep  ( associate producer ,  FAMILY PRIDE )  and members of both the production team and the cast will be present to discuss the series .  Central Television 's  first series of CHANCER  ( 1990 )  was an irresistible item on the television schedule for many millions of viewers .  A very strong leading rogue character played with great guile by Clive Owen emerged out of a <head>solid</head> plot supported by the matchless acting skills of Leslie Phillips . The face pace of CHANCER was another leading ingredient moving the story along briskly in the best of popular drama traditions .  Having saved the sports car company and turned himself in at the end of series one ,  Clive Owen led off the second series in 1991 completing the last days of a prison sentence and abandoning the city slicker lifestyle for a battle to save a bankrupt stately home .

Anderson seemed to be the only person at home ;  he sold them jugs of ale ,  small beer for the children ;  James 's  credit was good for a stone jar of whisky and one of the Duke 's  men was detailed to carry it on his back in a wicker frame .  They might have become becalmed there as their heads ballooned with the drink but the Duke told his piper to rouse their feet with a steady march ,  Murdo Mackenzie of Torridon ,  and they headed off downstream towards Grandtully past the standing stone ,  the quiet watcher ,  while damp black shadow massed in the river - channel as though the night came from there .  on the far bank Cameron had outstripped them , his army moving steadily down the strath , winning signatures at the house of Cluny , at Clochfoldich and Pitnacree , by the <head>solid</head> slow avalanche of their numbers , massing quietly round each house , hammering three times on each door . By this time every gentleman knew what was expected of him :  Cameron never dismounted ,  he leaned from the saddle and passed the paper down to the angry ,  helpless proprietor and took it back signed .

There is another branch of graphics ,  however ,  in which an image is produced by the use of line rather than mass .  In its most basic form the technique involves merely an outline ,  or when it is filled in ,  a silhouette ;  but of course it can be much more elaborate than that .  Linear representation of <head>solid</head> form has always been a valid artistic technique , especially in drawing ( as distinct from painting ) , and it can be used in marquetry work also provided the nature of the material ( ie . wood ) is not ignored . You have to remember that wood is really quite a coarse material  ( compared to fine metals ,  for instance )  and it is also stronger along the grain than across it .  This means that with wood veneer you cannot achieve very fine lines in a design but with care and good planning some quite delicate effects can be obtained  ( fig. 3 )  .

Whereas it is simple to make a robust chair ,  combining these three characteristics and yet producing a chair which has individual character can be a real challenge .

Although no one will doubt their possibilities for elegance and robustness , sitting on a <head>solid</head> wood seat can test the limits of comfort after quite a short time and woven seats are little better .

Most climbers park at the Belvedere de la Carelle  ,  a viewing point on the loop road that follows the rim of the gorge and ends at the little village of La Palud .

Heraklith Sound Insulation boards , for example , will improve the airbourne sound insulation index of a <head>solid</head> 250mm brick wall by 13dB ( 10dB means a reduction in sound level of 50 % ) . The boards ,  25 or 35mm thick ,  are a laminate of layers of Heraklith - M - Original magnesite - bound wood incorporating a flexible foam core .  It is the careful balance between the dynamic rigidity of the core and the weight of the surface layer which prevents significant resonance incursions .

These have a <head>solid</head> cellular core of unplasticised polyvinyl chloride ( upvc ) enclosed in a smooth , durable outer skin , and they can be sawn and drilled just like timber . They are rigid ,  completely impermeable to water and almost maintenance - free ,  simply requiring occasional washing to remove surface grime .  Another major advantage over the thinner types of cladding is that they provide additional insulation to exterior walls  ( which can be augmented by fixing them over an extra layer of insulation )  .

This is one of those English expressions so weathered that their emotional batteries are irretrievably flat but ,  from the lips of someone who spoke English with the cool precision of a fluent foreigner ,  the phrase was terribly affecting .  He probably intended it as an exact classical allusion .  In a <head>solid</head> South Bank Show ( LWT ) on Jimi Hendrix , Eric Clapton swore while describing his feelings when the guitarist died . Such are the times in which we live that the decision to leave his expletives unbleeped prompted tabloid news stories but ,  really ,  the programme was quite intensely moral .

Mason was ahead but Biggs for a while looked the stronger man and employed his superior technique to suggest that Mason might be running into trouble .

Despite being out - jabbed , the British champion kept boring forward and when he got inside , taking punches in order to do so , he landed some <head>solid</head> right hooks to the head and the body . There was never much conviction in the way Biggs fought ,  his attitude more that of a man boxing from memory rather than one attempting to resurrect a shattered career ,  and Mason was never persuaded that genuine peril might result from exchanges in the middle of the ring .  The manner of Biggs 's  defeat was to say the least surprising and on this evidence Mason has still a long way to go before he can think of himself as a genuine contender for the world championship .

The Dutch administration had long seen the need for consular representation in Jedda ,  the port of Mecca ,  where the security ,  health and transport of large numbers of Indonesian pilgrims could be supervised by the Batavian authorities .  In 1923 Van Der Meulen applied for the post of consul there and was selected for a three - year training in Arabic and Islam by the great Leiden Arabist ,  Snouck Hurgronje .  His studies in Leiden proved congenial to him and he developed a love for Arabia and Islam , which he felt provided a <head>solid</head> background for his Calvinist faith . His arrival in Jedda in 1926 coincided with the expulsion of the Hashemites from the Hijaz and their replacement by the strict Wahhabis under King Ibn Saud .  He thus witnessed the birth of Saudi Arabia and could observe its growth and development at a crucial period in its history .

Curiously ,  Palin made a point in the commentary about how he was n't pretending that he was on his own or that there were not gruff acolytes kneeling at his feet as he spoke .  Director Roger Mills even retained a quip from Alan Whicker  ( whom the presenter consulted )  about a Bernard Levin series in which the pretence of solitude was attempted .  This was fine , but <head>solid</head> evidence will have to be provided that the scene in which Palin woke up on the Orient Express to the knock of brioches at the door was the real thing . I expect the crew had tiptoed down very gently from the bunk above while he slept .  On the subject of rest ,  you twitched a bit when Palin was referring to feeling weary as early as the second day .

This victory may set Stretch up with a world - title elimination fight with Britain 's  other leading light middleweight ,  Chris Pyatt .  Pyatt ,  fighting on the same bill ,  was in equally devastating form ending the challenge of Wayne Harris of Guyana in the third round .  Despite conceding large advantages of height and reach , Pyatt went to work on Harris 's body with <head>solid</head> shots to the solar plexus . Pyatt has outstanding hand speed and he demonstrated it to full effect against an opponent who was clearly out of his depth .  Pyatt crashed in combinations at will in the third and a punishing left to the jaw broke the Guyanan 's  resistance ,  and referee Richard Davies rightly intervened .

She was ,  she explained ,  absolutely opposed to Gewalt  -  power .  No ,  he objected ,  surely she meant violence :  she was committed to non - violence .

Asquith made a speech of forty minutes which Benson described to himself as robust but dull ,  and which reads dully .  He spoke a message which the country has heard before  that taxation is too heavy ,  that unemployment  ( 1&frac12 ;  million )  is too high ,  that we spend far too much on armaments and must get disarmament in Europe ,  that we must stick to Free Trade Frank Salter , who was the Liberal candidate for Cambridge borough , made a genial <head>solid</head> speech of thanks . Then Ramsey rose to second the vote of thanks .  The local newspaper called his speech breezy .

The congregation of St Nicholas consisted of a few poor people from the neighbourhood and otherwise of less poor people from various parts  of the city or from Birkenhead across the Mersey .  Its congregation quite flourished .  John How was a <head>solid</head> good preacher but not a magnet to multitudes . He was formidable ,  laconic ,  self - disciplined ,  earnest but not humourless ,  and it was said of him that he did everything with a kind of good - natured fury .  Most of the time he left his two curates to get on with their thing .

He had learned everything that dragons need ,  but he had not understood any of it .  He built his dragons a garden ,  the most beautiful garden in the world ,  and although he surrounded it with an iron wall which he believed they would not cross ,  he made the wall beautiful for them ,  lavish with filigree work and sweet with hanging plants .  He built them a pagoda of <head>solid</head> jade and embellished it with precious gems not realising that to grow up a dragon must accumulate its own hoard , must steal it from Emperors and princes . He had a pond dug for them ,  so pretty and sweet ,  surrounded by bullrushes with a delicate arched bridge and floating with water lilies  Not realising that a real dragon needs a whole ocean to sport in ,  needs the spume of the white capped waves ,  needs the great storms and clanging icebergs ,  needs the coral islands of the southern seas ,  needs the dark rains and winds and currents to make its blood flow green and its whiskers curl ferociously .  The scholar fed his pet dragons on the choicest tit - bits ,  bringing them rump steaks of the purest virgins and a daily supply of swallows '  flesh  not realising that such things ,  for true dragons ,  are treats ,  are after - dinner delicacies and no more a fit diet than endless chocolates would be for you .
