Do you know what it is ,  and where I can get one ?  We suspect you had seen the Terrex Autospade ,  which is made by Wolf Tools .  It is quite a hefty spade , with bicycle - type handlebars and a sprung lever at the rear , which you step on to <head>activate</head> it . Used correctly ,  you should n't have to bend your back during general digging ,  although it wo n't lift out the soil and put in a barrow if you need to move it !  If gardening tends to give you backache ,  remember to take plenty of rest periods during the day ,  and never try to lift more than you can easily cope with .

For neurophysiologists and neuropsychologists ,  the way forward in understanding perception has been to correlate these dimensions of experience with ,  firstly ,  the material properties of the experienced object or event  ( usually regarded as the stimulus )  and ,  secondly ,  the patterns of discharges in the sensory system .  Qualitative Aspects of Experience The quality or modality of the experience depends less upon the quality of energy reaching the nervous system than upon which parts of the sensory system are <head>activated</head> : stimulation of the retinal receptors causes an experience of light ; stimulation of the receptors in the inner ear gives rise to the experience of sound ; and so on . Muller 's  nineteenth - century  doctrine of specific energies  formalized the ordinary observation that different sense organs are sensitive to different physical properties of the world and that when they are stimulated ,  sensations specific to those organs are experienced .  It was proposed that there are endings  ( or receptors )  within the nervous system which are attuned to specific types of energy ,  For example ,  retinal receptors in the eye respond to light energy ,  cochlear endings in the ear to vibrations in the air ,  and so on .

Quantitative Aspects of Experience There are three fundamental dimensions of quantity  in experience :   ( a )  intensity ;   ( b )   ( spatial )  extensity ;  and  ( c )  duration .  At a neurophysiological level , the intensity of an experience is typically reflected in the number of neurones <head>activated</head> ( the phenomenon of recruitment ) and , more specifically , in the firing frequency of the relevant neurones . Extensity  ( for example the size of a patch of light )  usually correlates with the number and spatial distribution of receptors activated .  Finally ,  duration is correlated with the period of time for which the relevant neurones are active .

Extensity  ( for example the size of a patch of light )  usually correlates with the number and spatial distribution of receptors activated .  Finally ,  duration is correlated with the period of time for which the relevant neurones are active .  ( I am leaving aside phenomena such as accommodation , whereby a constant stimulus when sustained may <head>activate</head> the nervous system progressively less intensively , with a corresponding reduction in the perceived intensity of the stimulus . These ,  and other features of adaptation ,  do not invalidate the underlying conceptual framework .  )  The earliest psychophysical observations demonstrated a correlation between the intensity of the physical stimulus and  subjective reports of the intensity of the resultant experience .

These choreographic sentences ,  no matter how short or long ,  broad or narrow ,  high or low must make sense within the total pattern or movement traced on the stage .  This pattern is made not only by the dancers '  feet as they move over the surface but also by the dancers '  bodies as they move through space .

Can body cells be the seat of a human cyclotron effect ?  The cyclotron needs a magnetic field and a transverse AC electric field to pump energy into ions in motion in that field .  There are ions <head>activated</head> by thermal motion in blood and these are always subject to the Earth 's magnetic field . Proximity to a weak 50Hz or 60Hz electric field therefore means that ions in a certain mass range can respond to cyclotron action .  The ions in water and blood happen to be in the critical mass range .

Labour hopes to transform the situation by increasing the number of A - levels to five for the brighter youngsters and providing grants for four - year training courses  ( two years in a Further Education college followed by two with an employer )  for the rest .  These reforms will only achieve their objective if accompanied by the implementation of the 1944 Education Act provision for compulsory part -  or full - time education or training up to the age of 18 .  This clause has never yet been <head>activated</head> . The sharply reduced number of 16 - 18 - year - olds will inevitably lead employers to bid up the wages of that age group to entice young people away from education and into unskilled or semi - skilled jobs .  Employers must be required to release 16 - 18 - year - olds for education and training for at least two days per week .

Although the country may have lost its strategic significance with the collapse of the Soviet Union ,  Washington is nevertheless concerned at the possibility of an unstable radical Islamic state growing up on the borders of the former Soviet Central Asia .

It destroyed morale throughout the regime , forcing commanders and party chiefs to <head>activate</head> their tribal links with the Mujahideen and save their skins before the time of reckoning . The effect has been to accentuate divisions between the majority Pushtuns  ( known in the days of the Raj as Pathans )  and the ethnic minorities of the north such as the Tajiks ,  who are kin to the people of the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan across the Amu Darya river .  The minorities have thrown off the Pashtun yoke ,  largely thanks to the military prowess of Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud ,  a Tajik from the Jamiat - e - Islami  ( Islamic Society )  opposition group .

The HT4 cortical cells ,  on the other hand ,  did not habituate to depolarisation .  After trying various neurotransmitters the group found that serotonin could potentiate the cell 's  response  ie  enhance the response to stimulation .  The difference between long and short term memory depends on whether certain NMDA ( N methyl - D - aspartate ) receptors were <head>activated</head> or not. A stronger  ( long )  serotonin stimulus causes the release of amino acids which activate the NMDA receptors ,  leading to long term memory .  A short stimulus gives only a transient NMDA elevation ,  but if the cells are treated with both serotonin and NMDA ,  then long term potentiation could be induced .

Wagner 's   ( 1976 ,  1981 )  theory of habituation ,  discussed at length in Chapter 2 ,  is also a theory of latent inhibition .  It will be recalled that ,  according to this theory ,  a stimulus is held to be fully effective only when it is able to generate the Al  ( primary activation )  state in the node that constitutes its central representation .  A node that is in the A2 ( secondary activation ) state ( either because its stimulus has only recently been presented or because it has been <head>activated</head> internally by means of an excitatory associative link ) will not be able to move into Al . Accordingly ,  a stimulus will be relatively ineffective both when it has itself recently occurred and also when it is presented along with cues that have previously signalled its occurrence .  ( In the case of habituation training ,  these cues will normally be those that constitute the context in which the stimulus has been presented )  .

Latent inhibition training can be expected ,  therefore ,  to establish a network of associations among the component parts that go to make up the stimulus .  McLaren ,  Kaye ,  and Mackintosh  ( 1989 )  made use of this suggestion in developing their account of latent inhibition .  Their proposal ( see Chapter 3 ) was that the associability of an element <head>activated</head> by external stimulation will be enhanced when this element lacks associative connections . The analysis offered by interference theory is similar ,  but rather simpler  it is that the existence of these  ( within   stimulus )  associations will interfere with the ability of the elements to form new ones .

And a tendency for the responding acquired to  to generalize to  will also explain why discrimination learning which requires the subject to make different responses to the two stimuli should be retarded .  Although the S - R terminology seems well fitted to the case in which  is a verbal label ,  it is possible to dispense with the reliance on the notion of response - produced cues that is central to S - R theory .  As we have seen , modern theories of Pavlovian conditioning assume that stimuli can <head>activate</head> the representations of other events . Such theories can therefore allow that an associatively activated representation may support generalization between stimuli that share the ability to elicit activity in this representation .  Thus both A and B could become directly linked with a representation of stimulus X as shown in Fig 5.10 ( a )  .

The central question in terms of the diagram used in Fig. 5.11 ( a )   ( see also Fig. 5.10 )  is why experience of A and B should reduce the effectiveness of the c  elements in producing generalization between these stimuli .  The critical aspect of differentiation theory in this context is its assertion that exposure to A and B will lead to an increase in the number of distinctive features that can be detected .  This must mean , in terms of the figure , an increase in the number of a and b elements <head>activated</head> by the stimuli , something that can be represented diagrammatically in more than one way . Figure 5.11 ( b )  shows an increase in the areas a  and b  with a consequent reduction in the proportion  ( although not the absolute number )  of c  elements activated by a stimulus .  figure 5.11 ( c )  presents a slightly different possibility in which the sizes of  the A and B circles have not been changed .

This implies that signals from HeLa cell cytoplasm have entered the chick nucleus and brought about this gene activation .  Another example illustrating the importance of cytoplasmic factors in continually controlling gene activity comes from fusing mature muscle cells with cells of a completely different type .  Mature striated muscle cells make muscle - specific proteins and when such a cell is fused with a variety of other cell types which include liver and cartilage cells , then muscle - specific genes are <head>activated</head> in these cells leading to the production of muscle - specific proteins . Identification of the new muscle proteins was made possible by fusing human cells with mouse muscle cells ;  the human muscle proteins are similar but distinct from those made by mice .  There can be no doubt ,  from these experiments ,  of the importance of factors in the cytoplasm controlling gene action .

But what commits the muscle to this final pathway and what ensures that all the necessary genes are turned on at the same time ?  In the case of muscle it seems that there is a master gene controlling the expression of all the main genes ,  known as myogenin and it is always switched on in mature muscle cells .  Its special property is that it can <head>activate</head> most of the genes that are required in the mature muscle . The myogenin gene has been isolated and can be introduced into non - muscle cells where it becomes integrated into their DNA .  The effect of introducing just this one gene is to switch off some genes and to set in train a sequence of gene activation so that the cell develops into a muscle cell with all the appropriate proteins  master gene is an appropriate description .

Initial experiments were performed on porcine platelets stimulated by thrombin but subsequently many substances  ( secretagogues )  have been found to provoke platelet aggregation :  ADP ,  adrenaline and collagen as well as thrombin provoked release of 5 - hydroxytryptamine and nucleotides from platelets  ( Mills et al ,  1968 )  .  In addition ,  immune complexes  ( Humphrey  Jaques ,  1955 )  ,  arachidonic acid  ( Kaplan et al ,  1979 )  and thromboxane A 2   ( Hamberg et al ,  1975 )  cause platelet release .  More recently , the degranulating action of platelet - <head>activating</head> factor has been demonstrated ( Chignard et al , 1979 ; McManus et al , 1979 ) . Some secretagogues  ( e.g. ,  ADP )  stimulate the release of certain granules  ( dense bodies ,  some  - granules but not the lysosomal granules )  ,  whereas thrombin stimulates secretion of all types of granule including lysosomes  ( Holmsen ,  1977 )  .  In addition to these physiological stimuli  many non - physiological stimuli stimulate platelet degranulation including calcium ionophores  ( Gerrard et al ,  1974 )  ,  lectins  ( Greenberg  Jamieson ,  1974 )  and latex and viral particles  ( Holmsen ,  1977 )  .

Thromboxane A 2  is a more powerful pro - aggregatory substance in platelets than the endoperoxides ,  and it has been proposed that it is the arachidonic acid metabolite that mediates platelet aggregation and the release reaction  ( Hamberg et al ,  1975 )  .  Whether platelet endo - peroxides have a proaggregatory role in their own right or only when converted to thromboxane A 2  has been the subject of many studies  ( Bunting et al ,  1983 )  .  However , from experiments using thromboxane synthetase inhibitors it appears that when platelets are <head>activated</head> and the prostaglandin cascade is triggered by release of endogenous arachidonic acid then the endoperoxides generated exert their proaggregatory effects by their conversion to the more potent compound thromboxane A 2 . However ,  when the thromboxane generation is suppressed it is probable that endoperoxides can be proaggregatory themselves  ( Bunting et al ,  1983 )  .  It has been proposed that endoperoxides and thromboxane A 2  activate platelets by acting as calcium ionophores ,  hence mobilising intracellular free calcium  ( Gerrard et al ,  1978 )  .

In the perversion of this process that typically occurs in Burkitt 's  lymphoma cells ,  any of three chromosomes containing the antibody genes ,  instead of reorganising their own DNA ,  exchange some DNA with chromosome 8 .  This led George Klein ,  of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden ,  to suggest  ( Nature  ,  vol 294 ,  p 213 )  that these translocations might not just activate the antibody genes on the normal rearranged DNA  they might also activate a proto - oncogene on chromosome 8 .

Malcom Green and Robin Perutz at Oxford University have harnessed matrix isolation work in the quest to find a simple way of <head>activating</head> methane , a process of enormous commercial interest because of the vast stores under the North Sea . The idea is to find a molecule that will attach itself to methane and then react so that the methane is converted into a product that is useful as a fuel  ( New Scientist  ,  vol 97 ,  p 441 )  .  No such molecules are known ,  but Green made a tungsten compound ,  called bis  ( cyclopentadienyl )  tungsten dihydride ,  that will attach itself to certain hydrocarbons .

The city 's  traders have installed 350 Point Rubis   ( ruby point )  terminals in department stores ,  small shops and restaurants ,  linked via telephone lines and the national Transpac data network to all but two of the big banks .  When a customer wants to pay for something through the system ,  he or she presents a banker 's  card or a Visa credit card to the shopkeeper .  To <head>activate</head> the system , the shopkeeper passes the card through a magnetic - strip reader in the terminal , enters the cost of the purchase , and the customer punches out a personal code on a detachable keypad . The terminal checks with the bank 's  computer that the number corresponds with the card ,  and that the customer has not spent over the limit of 200 that day .  If the transaction is in order ,  the display on the terminal writes oui  ,  and prints out a receipt .

It is never a good idea to sit for long periods but ,  if this is essential ,  get up from time to time in order to move the body .  If you do not do this the muscles may become fixed in a shortened state ,  putting a strain on joints and various internal organs .  The soles of the feet should be in contact with the ground because receptors in the feet directly <head>activate</head> the postural muscles throughout the torso . If these are not activated ,  by having the legs stretched out in front ,  for example ,  then you will end up sitting in a slumped manner .  This will ,  of course ,  affect the breathing and other vital functions of the body .

The gentlest way of doing this is to use the effect of the deprivation of something desired ,  and where the training of children is concerned ,  that something need be nothing other than the temporary withholding of manifestations of love .  It is believed ,  as already mentioned ,  that one of the greatest pleasures for a child comes from the security it feels when it knows that it is loved ,  and it is the ability to withhold manifestations of that love for a little while ,  or threaten so to do ,  that provides a non - violent means of securing acquiescence when it is required .  To advocate the starting of the process on a very young child might appear to be heartless , but the overriding need to generate within the child mind the beginning of a conscience and the instinctive urge to <head>activate</head> it , must be the guiding factor . The accusation ,  that person has no conscience ,  carries a condemnation of character ,  but the real culprit is the society which has failed to raise to a position of the utmost importance in the public mind ,  the fact that the human conscience is the very rock - bottom foundation on which civilisation rests .  The control which the withholding of love gives to a parent emphasises how tremendously important it is that a child should be genuinely loved in the first place .

The fluid phase of the body is a superb electrolyte that contains many extremely active biological species ,  especially enzymes ,  and components that are able to produce free radicals and other reactive species .  As a result ,  there are very few materials which are inert in the body and indeed it may be argued that none are truly inert in this context .  On the other hand , as the presence of a splinter of wood in the finger readily proves , tissues have very effective sensors for foreign objects , and defence mechanisms are readily <head>activated</head> . Although the immunological rejection processes that occur with organ transplants do not occur with synthetic materials ,  a complex series of reactions are available to deal with any invading object and biomaterials can be treated in much the same way as invading bacteria ,  setting up inflammatory processes .  The science of biomaterials and the success of future applications depends upon the improved understanding of the various phenomena that are associated with these interfacial reactions ,  collectively described under the heading of biocompatibility .

The voltage on pin 3 if IC5 stays ,  therefore ,  below that on pin 2 and the output at pin 6 remains low .  For a sustained output from IC2 however ,  capacitor C5 is enabled to charge up to a level exceeding that on pin 2 of the op.amp and the output switches high ,  so    turning transistor TR5 on and operating the relay which closes RLA1 contacts .  This closure is only momentary because of the differentiating action of the coupling components capacitor C6 and resistor R21 , and the rest of the circuit is then <head>activated</head> in the way already explained . The use of the relay at this point may seem a bit odd as the switching could be electronically activated ,  but the use of a mechanical relay introduces a small but desirable time variation  ( as well as possible bounce !  )  in the duration of the relays closure and so helps in enhancing the random operation of IC6 during the short time that the VCO is producing its high frequency output .  Only the function of diode D18 remains to be mentioned .

The immunity enjoyed by clownfish from the venomous tentacles of the anemone has only recently become properly understood .

The answer was found during detailed studies of the trigger mechanism which <head>activates</head> the anemone 's nematocysts or stinging cells . The anemone was found to be triggered into action by the protein - based mucus covering most fish and invertebrates and therefore stimulated into stinging by the taste of its prey .

Connecting the ME - 6 up to an amp ,  power amp or mixer is as easy as connecting any effect pedal ,  and once hooked up the ME - 6 can store 25 different effect combinations in five memory banks .  Each effect patch is identified by a combination of bank number and patch LED ;  the former appears in the value/bank readout while the patch is indicated by the relevant pedal .  BOSS have set up the ME - 6 to work in two different ways : it can be left to recall programmed patches or , by using the manual programming button , be set to operate like a series of pedals with each footswitch <head>activating</head> an effect in real time . As previously mentioned ,  the top panel display has a series of boxes with a description of the effect and a status LED showing if the effect is on or off .

When an emotionally articulate speaker wants to convey to me ,  not the fact that he is sad ,  but in what way and to what degree ,  his language becomes rhythmic and metaphorical ,  pulls me to his viewpoint to visualize his situation becomes a poetry which infects me with his melancholy and a rhetoric stirring me to help him ,  and afterwards perhaps I find myself regretting having committed myself to an action in his interests rather than my own .  He does not describe his emotions ,  he calls them up ;  if anything is described ,  it is the situation which excites them .  Imaginative writers know as an important item in their craft , that the way to convey emotion with most lucidity and particularity is to choose the apt words , not for the emotion itself , but for the image or scene which <head>activates</head> it . Nor does their command of verbal symbolism ,  the only medium in which one can even pretend to be describing inward states objectively ,  give them any advantage over painters and musicians .  The media through which the sharers of a culture refine their insight into what goes on in each other 's  heads are the arts in general ,  through which the most aware evoke in their audience the look and feel of things  from their own viewpoints  ( in the case of the drama and novel ,  of multiple interacting viewpoints )  ,  in fixed forms available to be explored at our leisure .

Proposals for syllabuses based on this reduced notion of communication also illustrate how the potential for change inherent in new ideas is stifled by assimilation into established patterns of thinking .  The syllabus is still conceived of as a collection of atomistic linguistic elements even though they are now functionally rather than formally defined .  It is still regarded as a preconceived construct which incorporates goals for learning , and its relationship with a methodology which <head>activates</head> the immediate process of learning remains as undefined as before . But the idea of communicative competence arises from a dissatisfaction with the Chomskyan distinction between competence and performance and essentially seeks to establish competence status for aspects of language behaviour which were indiscriminately collected into the performance category .  Now it seems reasonable to suggest that the competence/performance distinction might also mark the division of responsibility between syllabus and methodology ,  with the former specifying the knowledge to be acquired and the latter providing conditions for its behavioural realization .

This common knowledge of shared experience and conventionally sanctioned reality can be called schematic  knowledge :  it is the knowledge which is acquired as a condition of entry into a particular culture or sub - culture .   Schematic knowledge ,  then ,  is a necessary source of reference in use whereby linguistic symbols are converted into indices in the process of interpretation .  But we should note , too , that language development itself , the acquisition of knowledge of symbolic meanings , is <head>activated</head> by the need to extend schematic knowledge so as to cope more effectively with the social environment . We learn language in order to manage our affairs in the world we find ourselves in .  Language is the means of initiation into the conventions of conceptualization and communication which define particular cultures .

Rightly or wrongly ,  the investing public ,  and others ,  do not see going concern qualifications as purely objective assessments of the distribution of future cash flows designed to aid investors in their portfolio choice .  They see them as having wider connotations ,  which may include casting doubt on both management competence and the financial statements '  integrity .  For these reasons , client managements are unlikely to welcome a going concern qualification , and their concerns may well be reinforced if such a qualification restricts management freedom of action , possibly by allowing debt covenants to be <head>activated</head> , restricting the freedom to pay dividends , and so on . It may well be that risk - taking companies are managed by risk - taking individuals with powerful personalities .  Such individuals are likely to react adversely to anything they perceive as criticism of either their company or themselves ,  and may react by penalising the auditor by directing lucrative consultancy contracts elsewhere or even changing auditors .

On the basis of extensive research in a number of congregations in the United States ,  Peter Wagner has postulated an estimate of ten per cent who are either effectively or potentially gifted as evangelists .  If this percentage potential could be considered to hold true outside the USA ,  we would certainly have to ask of the great majority of congregations ,  What has happened to your ten per cent ?  If it exists at all , their efforts must be going unrecognised , or have been rendered inoperative , or were never <head>activated</head> in the first place . The fact that there is little or no evidence that a gift is operating does not necessarily mean ,  however ,  that it is not present .  Gifts can atrophy .

They are attached to an alarm and when the child wets during the night the circuit is connected which <head>activates</head> the alarm . The child should get up ,  go to the lavatory to finish urinating ,  and then with the help of the parents change the bed and reset the alarm .  The rationale for the use of this technique is a conditioning process in which the child associates relaxing of the bladder  sphinctre  with being woken up.

Cohort Theory views word recognition  ( for speech input )  as a bottom - up process of eliminating possible candidates by de - activation .  This is in contrast with its predecessor  ( Logogen Theory )  which assumes activation of only a single lexical item .  According to Marslen - Wilson and Welsh , a set of potential word candidates ( the cohort ) is <head>activated</head> during the earliest phases of the word recognition process solely on the basis of bottom - up sensory information . That is ,  all words sharing the same initial sound characteristics become activated in the system .  As the system detects mismatches between initial bottom - up sensory information and the top - down information about the expected sound representation of words generated by context ,  inappropriate candidates within the initial cohort are de - activated .

It is often possible to identify the characteristic eggs from a faecal sample ,  but regular treatment against this and other similar parasites is usually deemed preferable .   The embryonated infective eggs or larvae of the dog roundworm ,  Toxocara canis are ingested by the dog  ( 1 )  and migrate to the body tissues  ( 2 )  such as the kidneys .  Unfortunately , the larvae usually enter the tissues of developing foetuses ( 3 ) and localise in their intestines , being <head>activated</head> by the pregnancy . After the birth of the puppies the larvae can also migrate into the puppies '  system and infect them through the mother 's  milk  ( 4 )  The worms mature passing eggs in the puppies '  faeces which are consumed by the mother and can reinfect her  ( 5 )  .  Alternatively ,  larvae which fail to establish themselves and are passed out in the faeces ,  may find another host and begin producing eggs .

Both had become convinced that papal jurisdiction had been wrongful ,  and now wished to make use of the supremacy to strengthen the monarchy .  Their true intentions were revealed by their promotion of the 1536 Act Extinguishing the Authority of the Bishop of Rome ;  by their dissolution of the smaller monasteries ;  and by their execution of prominent opponents of their policy ,  such as Sir Thomas More ,  Bishop John Fisher ,  and the London Carthusians .  These moves convinced Pope Paul III that Henry 's disobedience was serious , and in an attempt to <head>activate</head> an earlier bull of excommunication against the king , he lent his support to the Northern rebels during the Pilgrimage of Grace . Henry 's  anti - papalism was based on the belief that the pope had wrongfully usurped the spiritual and temporal power which had traditionally belonged to the kings of England ,  and while he therefore rejected the pope 's  claim to jurisdiction in England ,  he was prepared to regard him as the rightful Bishop of Rome .  Others ,  however ,  including Cromwell and Archbishop Thomas Cranmer ,  were much more vehement in their condemnation of the papacy ;  attracted by the new ideas and reforming zeal of the continental Protestants ,  they argued that the papacy had falsified the word of  God and distorted true religion .

The difference is only in the kind of task and size of hardware .  For example ,  in the case of starting up a machine at a control panel the operator will be given the instructions and   asked to provide a verbal commentary as he actuates the various controls and checks the various indications ,  this is a talk through .  On the other hand , a maintenance check of a series of related machines may involve moving to and fro between them while <head>activating</head> this and that , this is a walk through . The operating instructions/task description can be modified if the analysis reveals any problems from the operator 's  point of view ;  anything which the designer may have omitted or any difficulties the operator has in moving around ,  manipulating controls or checking information presentations .  Ultimately ,  the machine layout or interface design may be modified to make the operating instructions easier to follow .

Some of the information was unreliable and amounted to a considerable wastage in air dropped ordnance and flying hours by launching bombing and strafing missions over dead jungle .  Army Intelligence and Police Special Branch informant networks allowed British South East Asia Command  ( SEAC )  to implement effective tactical plans to block and hit communist bandits  transiting  through the jungle towards hard civilian and military objectives .  As the Commanding Officer of 1 Squadron was also the Senior Strike Leader at Tengah , he had the task of <head>activating</head> operations as directed by SEAC . The Lincolns played an integral part in the overall harassment of the communist offensive campaign and were effectively the only permanent heavy bomber unit in Malaya .  Bombing sorties required exceptional skill and technical accuracy on the part of the Lincoln aircrews ,  particularly the navigation plotters and bomb aimers as most bombing missions required ordnance to be dropped on an exact point as opposed to the more conventional method of carpet bombing large areas .

More accurately ,  they launched an attack on the idea that activity in the autonomic nervous system was a sufficient condition for emotional experience .  The attack was based on a number of strands of evidence ,  including the fact that activation of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system was too diffuse to underpin the range of subtle emotional experiences of which we are capable ,  and the observation that severing the spinal cord in dogs does not prevent them displaying facial signs of emotion when provoked in an appropriate way .  As an alternative , Cannon proposed a centralist theory in which emotion was seen as the result of <head>activating</head> specific mechanisms in the central nervous system . However ,  his evidence did n't permit particularly precise localization within the brain .  It was n't until Papez  ( 1939 )  published his theory of emotion that the field really moved again .

It would certainly be naive just to assume that nerve cells are the same in molluscs as in people ,  but fortunately it is possible to rely on more than assumption .  The advantage of this sort of work is that the descriptions of cellular mechanisms are very detailed and this provides a good basis for determining whether the same cellular mechanisms are available in mammals .  For example , plasticity seems to depend on identifiable ion channels and catalytic molecules that <head>activate</head> or inhibit these channels . It is possible to use advanced biochemical techniques to look for comparable ion channels and catalytic units in the mammalian brain ,  without directly studying the role of cells in learning .  The problem with this approach is that it does n't allow for the possibility that there are additional cellular mechanisms of plasticity in mammals ,  that have evolved to underpin our greater learning abilities .

Each of the input neurons connects to every output neuron .  Output neurons can be activated in one of two ways ,  either by the output pattern generator line ,  or by the input cells .  The input cells are <head>activated</head> only by sensory input . The system is designed so that it will learn to generate output patterns in response to input patterns .  It can do this because the capacity of an input neuron to activate any of the output neurons increases every time the output pattern generator activates the output neuron simultaneously with external activation of the input neuron .

What emerges from this work is the complexity of the interactions between components of the system .  For example ,  loading the stomach with food or water directly has some satiating effect ,  but not as great as when the substance is also allowed to pass into the intestine or has previously passed through the mouth .  These findings raise another problem with stimulation methods , which is that the effects of stimulating at individual points in a system are only readily interpretable when the effects of <head>activating</head> separate parts of a system are additive . That is to say ,  the effects of activating two components together have to be the sum of the effects of activating either in isolation .  If this does n't occur with a relatively simple system like the peripheral mechanisms controlling appetite ,  there must be some doubt about how often this condition is satisfied in the central nervous system .

A further problem comes in deciding how to interpret differences in the amount of activity elicited by a set of conditions .  Does the brain use all of this information ,  or does it work on a trigger basis so that ,  once a level of activity has been exceeded ,  the actual level is irrelevant ?  For example , if a cell doubles its discharge rate under one set of conditions but quadruples under another , does that difference affect how subsequent levels in the circuit respond so that one group of cells is excited by the first set of conditions but a second group is <head>activated</head> by the second set ? These issues are far from resolved and affect our interpretation of some potentially significant findings .  Analogous studies outside the CNS

This is the stuff of colour constancy .  Our sense organs are not passive relays ,  but encode the constantly fluctuating patterns of stimulation impinging on the receptors into fluctuating patterns of neural activity .  These patterns are related to the patterns of input but already selective recoding has begun , since some aspects of the input will <head>activate</head> the nervous system more than others . For example ,  edges tend to activate the visual system more than areas of uniform brightness .  Changes of pressure across the fingertips produce much more intense input from touch receptors than steady pressure .

Independently of the discovery of X -  ,  Y -  ,  and W - cells came the demonstration of multiple representations of the visual field in the secondary visual cortex .  This is most clearly seen in studies of the primate visual cortex  ( Maunsell and Newsome 1987 )  .  Visual field representations are mapped by sampling successive locations in the visual cortex with a microelectrode and , at each location , determining where you have to place a stimulus in the visual field to <head>activate</head> single cells at that location . You find that cells in adjacent parts of the visual cortex are activated by stimulation in adjacent parts of the visual field .  The cortex is said to be retinotopically mapped .

Expression of Bcl - 2 completely inhibits the onset of apoptosis in serum - deprived Rat - 1 cells after c - Myc activation ,  as shown in Fig. 2 .  It is important to determine whether Bcl - 2 blocks c - Myc - induced proliferation as well as apoptosis :  the synergy between c - Myc and Bcl - 2 can easily be rationalized if Bcl - 2 blocks only the apoptotic function of c - Myc and leaves its mitogenic activity unaffected .  We examined the mitotic rate of Rat - 1/c - Myc - ER cells that were proliferating in low serum under the influence of - oestradiol - <head>activated</head> c - Myc , with and without Bcl - 2 expression . A proportion of the cells without Bcl - 2 died before undergoing division ,  as previously described ,  and thus could not be scored .  We excluded such cells from our analysis and studied 100 of the remaining cells ,  chosen at random ,  through their first divisions .

Our results demonstrate that acquisition of constitutive Bcl - 2 expression is an example of such a mutation .  Bcl - 2 mitigates the apoptotic effects of deregulated c - Myc expression without affecting its ability to promote continuous cell growth ,  so providing a mechanistic basis for the oncogenic synergy between these two proto - oncogenes .  The interaction between c - Myc and Bcl - 2 differs from the usual form of oncoprotein cooperation as observed between c - Myc and <head>activated</head> Ras in that , although c - Myc/Bcl - 2 fibroblasts proliferate continuously in the absence of mitogens , they neither appear to be morphologically transformed nor to form foci in monolayer culture ( Fig. 1 ) . The interaction between c - Myc and Bcl - 2 thus represents a novel type of oncogene cooperation ,  undetectable by classical transformation - focus assays .  Further characterization of the growth and death of cells containing various combinations of activated c -  myc ,  ras  and bcl   - 2 oncogenes should provide insights as to how the various attributes of these three classes of oncogene interact .

Consistent with this idea ,  Myc mutants with deletions of either helix - loop - helix or leucine zipper domains did not show any activity ,  though positive controls are not available for these mutants  ( data not shown )  .  The transactivation domain of Myc maps to the 177 N - terminal residues ,  consistent with the mapping of this domain in GAL4 - Myc chimaeras in mammalian cells .  The deletion mutant Myc N ( retaining residues 178 to 439 ) fails to <head>activate</head> in dimerization and in DNA - binding assays ( Fig 3 c ) , but efficiently enhances transactivation by Max - VP16 ( Fig. 2 b ) .

In our system ,  we upset the pattern of tension in the epidermis by cutting so as to create a free epidermal edge .  This abolishes the component of tension acting at right angles to the cut ,  while the tangential tension remains ,  suppressing lamellipodia and provoking formation of an actin cable ,  which in turn presumably reinforces the tangential tension .  The act of wounding may also trigger an influx of Ca 2+ , <head>activating</head> contraction of the cable ; and we have in fact shown elsewhere that c - fos is rapidly induced in the epidermis at a wound margin in rat embryos . We do not know how this activated state is subsequently maintained throughout the healing process ,  although the final overrun and pile - up suggest that it takes some time to switch off .  One attractive hypothesis would be that there is positive feedback ,  whereby tension in the cable generates an intracellular chemi -  cal signal for the maintenance of tension ;  this would maintain an activated state in every cell containing a segment of the taut cable .

Because the channel is in its low - affinity state ,  it may be positioned on the cGMP dose - response curve to be sensitive to a small decrease in free cGMP concentration ,  thus facilitating its closure .  A decrease in cytoplasmic Ca 2+  levels  ( estimated to be below 100nM )  will result because of the decreased influx of Ca 2+  through the channel .  This decrease in Ca 2+ will <head>activate</head> the guanylate cyclase , possibly through recoverin and limit phosphodiesterase activation . Calmodulin will also dissociate from the channel complex and cause the channel to switch to its high - affinity state for cGMP .  The channel will now reopen at a lower cGMP level ,  thus aiding the recovery of the ROS to its dark level as cGMP synthesis proceeds .

Long - term potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is the primary experimental model for investigating the synaptic basis of learning and memory in vertebrates .  The best understood form of long - term potentiation is induced by the activation of the  receptor complex .  This subtype of glutamate receptor endows long - term potentiation with Hebbian characteristics , and allows electrical events at the postsynaptic membrane to be transduced into chemical signals which , in turn , are thought to <head>activate</head> both pre - and postsynaptic mechanisms to generate a persistent increase in synaptic strength . THE assumption that information is stored in the brain as changes in synaptic efficiency emerged about a century ago following the demonstration by Cajal that networks of neurons are not in cytoplasmic continuity but communicate with each other at the specialized junctions which Sherrington called synapses .  External events are represented in the brain as spatio - temporal patterns of neural activity ,  and it is these patterns of activity which must themselves be the agents of synaptic change .

When many fibres are activated in synchrony by a strong stimulus ,  depolarization spreads between neighbouring synapses to enhance the unblocking of NMDA channels .  Associativity has a similar explanation except that the required depolarization is provided by a different set of afferent fibres ;  in theory ,  these helper inputs could use any neurotransmitter that promotes depolarization ,  and ,  experimentally ,  depolarization is often provided by injecting current into the cell .  Input - specificity is explained by the need for the presynaptic terminal to provide a sufficient concentration of L - glutamate to <head>activate</head> adequate numbers of NMDA receptors . ( It follows that there can be little activation of NMDA receptors by ambient or spontaneously released L - glutamate ,  otherwise LTP would be induced by depolarization alone .  )  Because the induction of LTP by tetanic stimulation is prevented by a variety of NMDA antagonists ,  including those which act at the receptor  ( such as 2 - amino - 5 - phosphonopentanoate  ( AP5 )  )  ,  in the channel  ( for example ,  MK - 801  ( ref .  25 )  )  and at the allosteric glycine site  ( for example ,  7 - chlorokynurenic acid )  ,  it is clear that activation of these receptors is an essential trigger for the process .

There is general agreement that PKC inhibitors will block LTP if they are applied after the tetanus ,  indicating that kinase activity outlasts the initial induction signal .  But the duration of the time - window during which kinase inhibitors are effective and the manner in which the activation of kinases is maintained are both matters of debate .  For example , it has been suggested that constitutively <head>activated</head> PKC is involved because H - 7 , which inhibits the activity of the catalytic subunit , but not sphingosine , which prevents the initial activation of PKC , can depotentiate synapses in a reversible manner even when applied up to 3h after induction . But the selectivity of H - 7 for potentiated pathways has been challenged ,  and other PKC inhibitors that act on the catalytic subunit ,  including K - 252b  ( ref .  85 )  ,  are not able to depotentiate fully established LTP .  There is also disagreement as to whether the sustained kinase activity that might be necessary for LTP is located within the postsynaptic cell or not.

Demonstration of the properties of cooperativity ,  input specificity and associativity .  The diagram at the top shows the experimental arrangement in area CA1 of the hippocampal slice preparation .  Two independent sets of afferent fibres converging on a common population of cells are <head>activated</head> by stimulating electrodes ( S1 and S2 ) placed either side of the extracellular recording electrode . The stimulus intensities are adjusted so that S1 activates fewer fibres than S2 .  The slope of the population e.p.s.p.s ,  in response to stimuli delivered alternately to S1 and S2 at 15 - s intervals ,  are plotted as a function of time .

The effect is small ,  develops gradually ,  is blocked by Ca 2+  channel antagonists ,  and requires stronger tetanic stimulation for its induction than is needed for NMDA receptor - dependent LTP .  Long - lasting potentiation can also be induced by transient exposure of hippocampal synapses to a variety of chemical agents ,  including Ca 2+166  ,  arachidonic acid ,  the metabotropic glutamate receptor  ( mGluR )  agonist aminocyclopentane - 1S,3R - dicarboxylate  ( 1S,3R - ACPD )  ,  the K +  channel blocker ,  tetraethylammonium  ( TEA )  and the G - protein activator NaF/AlCl 3  .  Chemically - induced potentiation usually occludes with tetanically - induced LTP ( that is , saturation of one prevents induction of the other ) , suggesting a convergence of mechanisms ; in general , chemically induced LTP is not blocked by NMDA antagonists , presumably because the components of the LTP cascade <head>activated</head> by the various agents lie downstream from the NMDA receptor . BOX 2 The role of amino - acid receptors in the induction of LTP This e.p.s.p .  can be blocked by the quinoxalinedione antagonists ,  such as 6 - cyano - 7 - nitroquinoxaline - 2,3 - dione  ( CNQX )  ,  and is usually referred to as AMPA receptor - mediated after the selective ligand for these receptors  -   amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionate  ( AMPA )  .

The results were independently confirmed by in situ  hybridization of the endogenous genes at selected stages  ( data not shown )  .  Our results focus on the reproducible phenotype generated by retinoic acid treatment at 7.5 days post - coitum  ( d.p.c .  )  .  The Hox - B1/lacZ transgene , like the endogenous gene , is initially <head>activated</head> in a broad domain at preheadfold stages , with an anterior limit mapping to the future r3/4 boundary . There is a progressive restriction of the anterior domain of expression which is limited to rhombomere 4 in the hindbrain by 9.5 d.p.c .  ( Fig.1 a - d  )  .
