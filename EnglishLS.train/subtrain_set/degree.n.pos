Part of the reason for this is that the American professoriat is the largest in the world ,  while the American market for current art is unprecedented ;  it is evident that the turnover of the American art market as a whole is the largest in the world .  The persuasive tax advantages for the rich to contribute works of art to public collections also play a part ,  contributing a measure of prestige shared between artists and the powerful in society .  Critics can also be invested with a <head>degree</head> of respect deriving partly from their academic connections . Another sort of authority derives from money ,  which a reader of art criticism may find it difficult to dissociate from an object .  Historical knowledge is the surest cure for this damaged intellectual condition ,  as the history of taste will show many examples of the irrelevance of monetary value to artistic quality .

Remember that there may be some twelve to eighteen places at any one of the drama schools ,  and the number of auditions may number up to fifteen hundred for the leading schools .  Don't be daunted by that ,  but recognise that like everything else in the acting business ,  it is highly competitive .  No drama school panel is looking for the ultimate in audition technique but candidates should possess a noticeable <head>degree</head> of competence and self - awareness . Not all auditions have just two speeches ,  classical and modern .  You may well be asked to sing something unaccompanied ,  or do a short improvisation and you may well be asked to perform one of the speeches in a different way .

If you have done any class work before attempting the drama school audition ,  most of the teachers will at some point in their sessions have talked about relaxation .  A lot has to do with how you breathe and how you react physically to moments of tension .

I would suggest that if you are sure of your pieces ,  do n't read them over and over again on the way to the audition  once will be quite enough .  Nerves afflict everyone in some way ,  and without them acting would be the poorer .

In the South ,  the marginality of the third main political party ,  the Irish Labour Party ,  is an indication of just how successful the articulation of capitalism to religious and national beliefs is .

Despite the principal duality of Irish party political power , the bourgeois structure of the state has rarely been questioned , only the <head>degree</head> of state intervention in the bourgeois economy . Also ,  the clerical church has been particularly antipathetic to socialism in any form .  It showed itself to have a horror of socialism already in the nineteenth century .

Catholic morality approves of the view that to repel an aggressor is to engage in a just war .

This monopoly position is therefore totally beyond criticism .

Hence the traditional alliance between catholicism and nationalism might be split at the popular basis with the ensuing growth of a <head>degree</head> of anti - clericalism . However ,  as the very existence of the catholic  nationalist alliance impedes progress towards such a solution ,  one should perhaps view such a possibility as unreal .  The Roman catholic leadership in Ireland has first to change and radically evaluate its monopoly beliefs ,  thus permitting the dissolution of one of the most antagonistic aspects of catholic  nationalist hegemony .

The pressure to remodel old pubs is of course nothing new .  The Victorian and Edwardian eras witnessed many wholesale rebuildings of modest Georgian drinking - houses ;  during the Interwar period even more money was pumped into enlarging and rebuilding old pubs ,  as well as in creating large new ones  ( see Alan Powers '  essay below )  .  However , alterations were more often than not effected with some <head>degree</head> of sympathy for the existing fabric and atmosphere . With the advent of postwar Modernism much of this sympathy evaporated .  The ascetic modernists '  rejection of history in order to create a visionary brave New World was clearly incompatible with the historic pub .

Both these establishments seem to have had an architectural form very similar to the ordinary domestic buildings of their area ,  and the hall provided the communal eating and drinking space .  The tavern was a meeting place ,  usually in the centre of the town or village ,  where wine was normally served .  According to John Earle , writing in 1628 , the inn was a superior establishment to the alehouses and was a <head>degree</head> or ( if you will ) a pair of stairs above an alehouse , where men are drunk with more credit and apology . The alehouse in its most basic form was simply a domestic building where ale was sold to generate additional income for the household ,  although David Lupton observed in 1632 that the alehouse keeper  defies a wine tavern as an upstart outlandish fellow ,  and suspects the wine to be poisoned .  Her ale ,  if new ,  looks like a misty morning ,  all thick  .

He described the  study of precedent and case law as being real academic activity for police officers ,  thus supporting my contention that research into the philosophy of control is unreal or polluting .  He spoke revealingly about the problems he had had with jurisprudence ,  bemoaning the fact that it was ambivalent and undefined ,  concerned primarily with the ambiguity which sustains the anthropologist by revealing the centralities of a system :  it was all grey areas ;  no black and white certainties or decisions ;  no precedent or case law giving the definitive interpretation .

He must come to terms with living with this consciousness and with the inherent problems he will face in revealing this knowledge to the outside in an ethnographic account .  Moreover ,  he must come to terms with a new awareness of what he has previously accepted ,  perhaps without thinking ,  which under the intense microscope of social enquiry may well seem to verge on the ludicrous or to be morally indefensible .  And having long been supported by the institution he will be crucially aware that it expects a <head>degree</head> of loyalty verging on deference or acquiescence . In such an archetypal world ,  where good is constantly and insecurely balanced in an eternal struggle against evil ,  the  objective explication of the rituals and symbols which surround and mystify police work can seem tantamount to a treasonable act .  In 1979 ,  James Anderton ,  the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester ,  described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from seditionist interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy  ( Thompson 1979 :  380 )  .

It would be paradoxical for them to be in the vanguard of social change ,  for as Templeton  ( 1980 )  points out ,  they are there to preserve the structure ;  to uphold the state of play .  But there are a few who are  questioning the  state of play ,  and who agree with Ben Whitaker  ( 1979 :  312 )  when he urged that police thinking would profit if it more often came out of its shell and concerned itself with wider questions about the role of the police and human relations .  However , this is not always easy to achieve , as I found out when I first returned to work in 1977 after my <head>degree</head> course . In order to continue postgraduate studies I had applied for some financial assistance for part - time fees ,  under a scheme created by the Home Office and set up specifically in recognition of a lack of higher educational qualifications in the police service  ( HO Circular 29/74 )  .  This directive encourages officers to research and study in their own time and lists suitable subjects ,  which include public administration ,  management studies ,  economics ,  law ,  criminology ,  social sciences ,  youth work ,  English language and literature and relevant modern languages .

The circular goes on to point out that the list is not exhaustive and suggests other courses may be appropriate .  I had applied to continue full - time research following my <head>degree</head> course , but this had been turned down by my chief officers ; however , I had been told that assistance for part - time study would almost certainly be approved in view of the national policy of encouraging officers to extend their educational qualifications . I then found my application for financial assistance for part - time study had been rejected because anthropology is not on the approved list of subjects  ( in the Circular )   ( Memo from HQ 1977 )  .  Eventually I was able to convince my senior officers that anthropology was  one of the social sciences ,  perhaps only because I somewhat sardonically returned a memo which asked why ,  if anthropology is not approved ,  have I just been allowed to read the subject on a Bramshill Scholarship ,  on full pay and allowances ?

Indeed ,  the fact that he had apparently used an editor from a Manchester newspaper for some of his purposes was latched onto and quoted as a sign that he was suspect and disloyal .  One consequence of these modes of thought is that the service has to live out a continuous and enormous paradox .  Even at the same time as it publicly commends higher education , seeking out the graduate entrant , spending large sums on publicity to this end , and funding access to <head>degree</head> courses on scholarships , it also holds to a central ethic of distrust of the academic . Whitaker  ( 1979 :  229 )  clearly understands the way this rejection of training and education operates within the service :  at present good recruits often have to be chased to Bramshill on the lengthy command courses ,  because chief constables are not anxious to spare able men ,  and officers themselves are reluctant to be separated from their families and homes ,  as well as having a fear that they might lose from being out of sight ,  out of mind for promotion .

Furthermore ,  such pressures are limited ,  thus creating a situation where there has been hardly any research on the police compared with the large output of critical scholarship on industry ,  commerce ,  the civil service ,  the health service and education what little direct research there has been on the police has scarcely begun to ask such fundamental questions as what is the police force and what is it doing .  This point ( Wojtas 1982 ) occurs in a description of a new research centre for Police Studies at Strathclyde University , which is to ask whether anyone is doing research on the police , what <head>degree</head> of co - operation they have met and to encourage research by the police themselves . Once again ,  however ,  defensiveness won the day and when the Strathclyde Centre circulated forces asking them to co - operate in the venture ,  a decision was taken to withhold co - operation and a circular went round to this effect ,  suggesting the existing Home Office funded PRSU  ( Police Research Services  Unit )  and the Home Office Research and Planning Unit were adequate for the needs of the service .  This latter unit  ( formerly the HO Research Unit )  does provide some research material for those who seek it out and its bulletin is a reference source to recent government funded research ,  which is largely concerned with operational systems and the tools of policing .

The conference was also told that as an alternative to the expense of sending officers to university ,  it was proposed to  direct  officers to research a particular problem and give them a short period to carry out intensive research .

Furthermore , such short periods of directed research can be shown favourably as a saving over any extended <head>degree</head> course in the budgets . The emphasis of this directed  ( or controlled ?  )  research ,  it was announced ,  is to be on pragmatic ,  problem - solving enquiries  ( i.e. policy - orientated research )  ,  which ,  it was explained ,  would be of cost - effective advantage to the force .

The dark uniform we wore had a military cap with polished brim ,  and in our fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boots we presented an avenging image ,  clothed in the symbolic colour of death and darkness .  Black is a light absorbent , non - reflective colour and most suitable for controllers who operate with a <head>degree</head> of social anonymity , upholding the rule of law and the abstractions of the legal system . In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .  As Reiner  ( 1980 )  suggested ,  the riot gear in which the police are increasingly seen ,  with shields ,  visored helmets ,  knee - length boots ,  and flame - proof overalls ,  enhances their avenging appearance .

The detective on the other hand ,  immediately sets out to reduce these culturally created separations ,  for he needs to negotiate a statistical reality with the dirty prig opposition .  The real polis is programmed to maintain a conceptual purity by maintaining structural distance ,  while the detective ,  of necessity ,  is forced to reduce this to carry out his deal with the dirt .  By reducing the social space between the dichotomies of ordered law enforcers and uncontrolled prigs , the detective necessarily returns a <head>degree</head> of humanity to the prig which the uniform collar feeler is always structured to deny .

Thus , there is some <head>degree</head> of selfdetermination in the ship case because we are free to shut our eyes , to cross the river and see it move from right to left , free to jump into the water and watch it coming towards us , free to determine the speed with which it passes across our visual field by moving our eyes with or against its movement . In the house example ,  we can choose the order in which we see the parts of the building but we surely cannot see occluded portions ,  and we surely cannot look up to see a thatched roof  because that 's  the kind of roof we want to see  when the roof is tiled .  In fact ,  in every microsecond of perceptual experience there is a tension between the real as refractory ,  as something we cannot choose or will ,  and the subjective as chosen and willed .

Scientific measurements may correct ,  reform or at least question individual unaided observations but there cannot be a systematic ,  universal discrepancy .  The cash value of scientific observations in this context must therefore be based upon subjective experience and cannot be greater than the cash value of the  latter ;  for it is subjective experience that ,  ultimately ,  validates our objective scales of energy intensity .  We may use physical methods of measuring light intensity that are apparently independent of our subjective experience for instance photosensitive cells but these are accepted because they correlate to a greater or lesser <head>degree</head> , under normal circumstances , with subjective experiences of brightness . If there were simply no correlation whatsoever between the electrical output of a photo - electric cell and some other measure of light intensity directly or indirectly related to experience ,  it would not have been accepted as a way of measuring light intensity .  However indirectly related to sensory experience a laboratory quantification of a particular form of energy may be ,  in the end the rate of exchange between one form of energy and another  the way in which we compare the quantity of one with the quantity of another  -  reposes upon the gold standard of subjectivity .

Despite the immediate success of the new fleet of 125mph trains which brought new standards of safety and on - board comfort firstly on the Western Region services out of London  ( Paddington )  and then on the East Coast main line from London  ( King 's  Cross )  ,  so much of what had been gained in the late 1970s was lost as the economic recession started to bite .  The impact was twofold .  The sharp decline in business activity severely reduced the volume of full - fare first - class ticket sales while the increase in unemployment and interest rates curtailed to a drastic <head>degree</head> levels of disposable income available for leisure purposes such as optional standard - class rail journeys . This loss of optional travel was also exacerbated by the intensified competition from longdistance coaches following the liberalisation of route licensing in the 1980 Transport Act .  Given the choice in such circumstances ,  many of InterCity 's  customers on low or fixed incomes  in particular students and senior citizens  preferred the cheaper but slower coach option .

BR could not avoid passing its dramatically increased costs following the oil crisis on to its customers ,  especially London commuters ,  and as they reduced in number  ( demand falling at 1 per cent a year )  services ,  stock and facilities were reduced to match demand ,  inevitably causing poor morale .  Even the ever - ebullient Sir Peter Parker saw parts of the commuter system rattling into decline ,  and nobody was surprised when in 1979 the government referred the services to the Monopolies  Mergers Commission. The Commission 's report was perhaps the turning point , for while it paid respect to the management it found to be totally dedicated to the railway with a high <head>degree</head> of pride in the service which came before financial reward in importance , it made thought - provoking recommendations about management style and the need to set clearer financial objectives . In particular BR were advised to create a new senior post at headquarters with special responsibility for London and the South East .  How did the transformation come about ?

Through the late 1980s another force was at work which turned the Provincial sector 's  fortunes further round .

Few would deny that the railway is admirably suited to carrying this type of traffic .  So as the 1980s drew to a close ,  the sub - sectors dubbed Coal ,  Construction ,  Petroleum and Metals were all in fine shape ,  and their outlook for the 1990s is promising .  Not that the eighties were without their problems : quite apart from the industrial recession of the early years , which affected all Railfreight 's bulk traffics to some <head>degree</head> or other , there was the historic miners ' strike of 19845 , taking heavy toll of steel as well as coal carryings . Happily the coal traffic was revived to the point where pre - strike tonnages were exceeded ,  although the number of individual collieries served was vastly reduced .  The merry - go - round system which allows loading and discharge to take place while an entire train remains in motion has continued to form the mainstay of Railfreight Coal 's  operations ,  and it is difficult to imagine a more efficient alternative .

Moreover whole hops used for dry hopping take seven to 10 days for the character to be extracted and then slowly decline .

Because of the <head>degree</head> of processing involved , hop extracts are not necessarily cheaper than using whole hops . Per unit of bitterness they are roughly as costly .  Instead their attraction lies in their flexibility to ensure greater consistency in both bitterness and flavour ,  in avoiding the effects of oxidation and in being easier to handle and more suitable for bulk brewing procedures .

That shared culture has gone ,  though its traces have persisted for a long time ,  at least among those unworldly older academics who assume that students of English will have read the whole of Shakespeare in the sixth form ,  or that they can readily identify classical or biblical references .  The belated realization that these things are no longer so leads to the embittered and baffled reaction that they ought  to be so .  However , that is a declining reaction ; the experience of regularly interviewing would - be entrants to an English <head>degree</head> course soon induces a sense of realism . In the state of affairs that still obtained when I entered the profession in 1959 the grammar school teacher and the university teacher of English were not radically different kinds of person ;  indeed ,  contingent or accidental factors might have determined which career path was followed .  Since then there has been a marked divergence between school and university ;  students have become less well equipped ,  and academics ,  particularly young ones ,  have become more high - powered ,  ambitious ,  and professionalised .

I like Graff 's  proposals ,  but they seem to me utopian .  They might work in the graduate school of a good American university ,  where a variety of methods already abounds .  I cannot see how they could be established in British literary education , where there are no graduate schools as such , and the narrow , uphill tunnel of A - level work leads on to the rocky , cloudy uplands of the undergraduate <head>degree</head> , with its confused mixture of practical criticism and thematic study , analysis and literary history , coverage and special subjects . Undergraduates of moderate ability do not much like being asked to choose between differing judgements on the same text ;  I can imagine them becoming confused and resentful if they were asked to choose between different critical approaches and all their attendant ideological baggage .  Certainly ,  I have known some undergraduates who would rise brilliantly to such a challenge ;  but they are an exception ,  and one cannot base a course on what would suit the exceptional student ,  much as one would like to .

There would be no fixed canon ,  and no coverage .  Such a degree course would not suit everyone ,  but it might well be attractive to the late entrants and mature students who are increasingly common participants in higher education ,  particularly in the humanities ,  and who bring valuable experience of life and work to their study ,  but may have rather little formal preparation .  It would also be more appropriate for the unambitious students of moderate talents who currently apply for an English <head>degree</head> , but would be more at home in a less intensive programme of liberal study . Cultural Studies would provide a more productive environment for the radical aca - English Departments ,  who have conspicuous energy and intelligence ,  but little literary sensibility or aesthetic interests .  Literature ,  when taught in such a context ,  would ,  no doubt ,  be given a culturalist and contextualist treatment ,  and I believe that there is nothing inherently objectionable about this .

It might well appeal to poets or would - be poets ,  who ,  contrary to popular myths about inspiration ,  are usually keenly interested in the technical aspects of composition .  What I have proposed in the foregoing pages is a conscious surrender to the culturalists of much of the activity that now goes on in English <head>degrees</head> , in order to retain something more coherent , defensible , and inherently valuable . Culturalists will point out  as C. S. Lewis once did  that much poetry of the past was not written for aesthetic ends ,  but for religious ,   political ,  or other social purposes .

But a restatement of that ancient affinity should strengthen poetry against political and culturalist claims .  The academic study of music may be a specialist field ,  but music ,  of every kind ,  is widely diffused and performed ;  only a small percentage of those attending concerts or recitals will have taken degrees in music .  Similarly , one would like to see a state of affairs in which many more people read and enjoyed poetry than had taken a <head>degree</head> in it . The degree in poetry I have outlined would attempt to be open about its theoretical assumptions .  I do not believe there is any absolute virtue in such openness ,  in fact ,  I think that education is ideally carried on in a shared form of life where there is agreement about fundamentals and attention can be concentrated on the task in hand .

There ,  too ,  under China 's  post - 1997 regime ,  Peking would be free to declare Martial Law ;  and there ,  too ,  a garrison of the People 's  Liberation Army would stand ready to suppress opposition or criticism by whatever means Deng and his successors deemed appropriate .  More grist has filled the pessimists '  mill in the years since the Joint Declaration ,  as Peking has grown more assertive and London more timid .  Within months of the signing ceremony , China was objecting vigorously to British proposals for introducing a meaningful <head>degree</head> of democracy to Hong Kong 's political structure . Britain bowed limply to China 's  demands  even though this meant weaseling - out of previous pledges to put a representative elected government into Hong Kong before 1997 ,  and even though Peking itself had promised a Hong Kong run by Hong Kong people .  The Foreign Office and the Hong Kong government tried to camouflage their retreat with windy evasion ,  talking piously of the need to create convergence between what Hong Kong wanted for its future ,  and what China was prepared to permit .

However ,  a widening of access requires that the universities attract and support under - represented groups ,  such as working - class school - leavers ,  black and Asian students ,  parents and mature workers .  Simply increasing the number of university places will not in itself increase access .  Without a major programme of affirmative action in recruitment , admission , teaching , and assessment , any expansion of higher education will result in more privileged middle - class young people gaining <head>degrees</head> . The majority of British people do not find universities attractive or accessible .  If the current proposals are not informed by an accurate assessment of the attitudes of a representative sample for working - class school leavers and their families ,  then their relevance to the issue of access is unproven .

There is a crack group like Nexus here ,  for heaven 's  sake ,  and nobody knows .

Considered purely as a recital by Golani , this was a riveting evening : in such a <head>degree</head> of intimacy her restless prowling , crouching , rising to full height , even stamping , combines with the intense commitment of her playing not to impede the music but to dramatise it , to add a further dimension to its urgency .

The political consequences are first increasing loss of control and crumbling of the party apparatus ,  next the state 's  need to fall back on the army and police to preserve its own existence ,  public order and ,  it claims ,  the chance of imposing painful economic reforms .  Martial law ,  capable of preserving order but not reversing economic decline ,  in turn yields to semi - pluralism as the principle of the party 's  monopoly of power is jettisoned to create a national consensus behind measures to salvage the country 's  economy .  Army rule and multi - party democracy are , to an almost equal <head>degree</head> , anathema to the Soviet party leadership , Mikhail Gorbachev included . Moreover the Politburo can argue both that political pluralism is no panacea for economic problems ,  and that it is much easier to apply in Poland than in the vast multi - ethnic Soviet empire .  In proposing a ban on strikes ,  the Soviet leadership therefore wished to nip the incipient labour movement in the bud .

But nor is it fair that with 6 or 7 per cent of the vote ,  the West German liberals should be the sole arbiters of who rules in Bonn .  The case for electoral reform is best discussed in terms of the question :  what kind of political system do we want ?  Our electoral system strongly favours two - party government ; other people 's systems , in varying <head>degree</head> proportionate , result in coalitions of a usually centrist tinge . The difference goes far deeper than the political complexion of the government .  The strong tendency of pluralistic systems of Europe is consensual and ,  in some cases ,  quasi - corporatist ;  on the other side of the coin ,  they enable extremist minorities to thrive .

And ,  further ,  in areas like Easton ,  where there is very little crime related to the troubles ,  the police do not on the whole develop the attitude that law and order is a battle between the RUC and Catholics .  This encourages a balanced view of Catholics ,  something which ,  as we shall emphasize in later chapters ,  can be absent amongst some policemen beleaguered behind their reinforced stations in areas of high tension and conflict .  A final point worth making in defence of the data is that the observational material cannot be impugned to the same <head>degree</head> , because in the flow of action during an incident the exigencies of the situation usually take over , making it difficult for policemen and women to act in ways contrary to what the situation requires or their colleagues demand . Hence many extracts from the data used in this volume are near - verbatim records of natural conversations in reallife settings .  While on the whole we feel knowledge of the field - worker 's  religion was not detrimental to the research ,  we believe it also had positive effects ,  in that it immediately forced respondents to confront their attitudes towards Catholics ,  as did the field - worker 's  gender in relation to sex roles in the force ,  placing both issues high on the research agenda .

Their <head>degree</head> of preference for one party Over others had an important influence upon the usefulness - ratings they gave the media for helping them decide how to Vote ( those with clear preferences found the media less useful for that purpose ) but had little or no influence on other aspects of usefulness - ratings .

Since that showed a <head>degree</head> of consistency in attitudes , it was not entirely unexpected . More surprising was the relationship with political interest .

Television scored best on helping people decide how to Vote if they found politics interesting during the campaign but had lacked a general interest in politics in the mid - term .  Television therefore helped make up the minds of those who were newly interested  in politics ,  or unusually interested  in politics ,  interested in the election campaign but not very interested in politics more generally .  Ratings of radio news were less predictable than ratings of television but they too were influenced by recent political interest , motivations for following the campaign , and <head>degree</head> of party preference . Once again ,  perceptions of bias had no influence .  Similar factors explain newspaper ratings also .

The conceptual distinction between perceptions and attitudes is clear ;  but perceptions of party chances or the state of the economy imply an element of approval or disapproval when articulated by the electorate .  ( They are purely objective perceptions when articulated by political scientists or professional economists ,  of course .  )  These perceptions were influenced in varying <head>degrees</head> , though not completely determined , by partisan loyalties . As the election approached ,  perceptions about party chances of victory became more homogeneous :  most voters thought Conservative chances were good and Alliance chances were poor .  Perceptions of Labour chances remained more predictable ,  though they too became rather more homogeneous as the campaign came to an end .

The concept of a national centre has been a hierarchical mental device used by historians since the Reformation to over - simplify the chaos of diverse local stimuli .  In primitive societies with small ,  self - sufficient units there was no differentiation between centre and periphery ,  and it could be argued that many peasants in Russia remained at  this level of perception during NEP .  Yet urban , industrial polarization had already developed to a considerable <head>degree</head> before 1917 , creating awareness of the political centre among the more sophisticated peasant strata such as village teachers , zemstvo clerks , bookkeepers , doctors ' and veterinarians ' assistants . E. D. Vinogradoff has shown how local agrarian social and economic conditions shaped the collective political behaviour of peasants elected to the Fourth State Duma .  This was clearly the case in the Central Agricultural Region ,  which we shall consider in Chapter 2 .

The partial compensation found in the fertility of the black and brown immigrants of the Commonwealth countries who had sent over 3 million people into Britain since 1962 did not meet with universal enthusiasm ,  as the evidence from the Race Relations Board frequently suggested .  Afro - Caribbeans huddled in ghetto areas like Brixton or Southall .  Non - white Britons were having a growing impact , notably in mass sport and entertainment ; commercial advertisements to an increasing <head>degree</head> focused on a poly - ethnic consumer market . But only an enlightened few saw this as a symbol of national renewal .  In the face of this varied sense of internal malaise ,  the return of the Thatcher government ,  with its young - Turk generation of monetarists and entrepreneurs ,  marked at least a change of gear ,  even if the privatization of publicly - owned enterprises was a very minor feature of the Conservative manifesto in 1979 .

The real essence of Thatcherism ,  indeed ,  lay not so much in its ideas ,  which proved to be increasingly malleable as the years went by ,  and especially when Nigel Lawson took over the Treasury in  1984 .  It lay rather in the company it kept ,  the classes with which it was associated .  As noted , Mrs Thatcher came from a relatively humble , unprivileged background , though a <head>degree</head> at Oxford and later marriage to a millionaire businessman gave her a distinctly haut bourgeois status in time . But her outlook was subtly different ,  say from that of Edward Heath ,  whose father was a carpenter in a small town in Kent and who ,  like Mrs Thatcher ,  went to a local grammar school rather than the private boarding schools favoured by most Tory leaders .  The Heath background was one of constructive ,  but deferential ,  working - class Toryism .

Indeed ,  Fleet Street itself was a misnomer from 1985 onwards ,  as modern technology and high unit costs led major newspapers to move out of central London to the eastern inner suburbs ,  to avoid the unions '  stranglehold .  The long ,  sometimes violent ,  dispute with the print unions over the relocation of The Times  plant at Wapping marked a notable step both in the new financial and technological independence of the press and its ideological separateness from the union - corporate approach of the past .  The Church of England was also , to some <head>degree</head> , a victim of the Thatcherite attempt at hegemony . The Church had continued to lose members in the 1970s and 1980s ,  yet it remained a powerful source of social criticism .

For decades ,  as the Royal Commission on Wealth and Income demonstrated in the late 1970s ,  those disparities were modified by the social benefits available under the welfare state .  By the end of the 1980s ,  partly as a result of deliberate government action ,  more perhaps because the unduly optimistic assumptions of Beveridge and other founders of the British welfare system were being falsified by financial and cultural factors  ( such as the breakdown of the old nuclear family of fabled tradition )  ,  the welfare state was far less able to temper the asperities of a harsh and divided society .  The beleaguered ranks of social workers and investigators of the 1980s documented a society more unsettled , more helpless , and to some <head>degree</head> more violent than at any period since the century began . Finally ,  there was constant angst  about Britain 's  world role .  The direction of Britain 's  post - imperial policy was unclear after 1945 .

When a considerable proportion of the industry is working competitively for the market ,  the inducement to employees and employers to introduce and operate incentive schemes will be greatly strengthened .  Experience in the past two and a half years has shown both the general effectiveness of such schemes and the need for a much wider extension of them .

The distortions which occur under a system of all but exclusively local authority house - building  the tendency to conform to the past rather than the future location of population  ( with consequent immobilisation of labour )  ,  the wrong proportion of houses of different sizes ,  and the provision of more amenities than those for which tenants are prepared to pay the economic price  these will naturally correct themselves when private building is restored .  To combat the opposite extreme of jerry - building ,  we would make membership of the Housebuilders '  Registration Council 's  register compulsory upon all contractors for local authority houses ,  with a view to rendering the building industry eventually an industry subject throughout to publicly - approved standards .

In order to do this , however , Britain must herself become in some <head>degree</head> protectionist and place tariffs on foreign imports of at least the things which the Dominions had to sell to her above all , food , if not also raw materials . It was thus a revolution in British fiscal policy which Chamberlain advocated in the name of Empire ;  and from his Birmingham speech in May 1903 until he was struck down three years later his advocacy of tariff reform and his Imperial theme dominated British policies .  Yet the Imperial side of the argument  whatever view may be taken of the fiscal ,  economic and domestic  would not stand up to examination .

Mrs Thatcher has been fortunate in that retirements of several senior personnel in the early 1980s gave her the opportunity to influence promotions ;  there were thirteen appointments as Permanent Secretary in 1982 alone and she has had a hand in appointing the great majority of Permanent and Assistant Permanent Secretaries since 1979 .  The traditional trade - off for the secure tenure of senior British civil servants has been that they are anonymous and politically impartial .  To some <head>degree</head> the impartiality has depended on there being a large measure of policy agreement and continuity between the parties in government . The doubts of some pre - war Labour leaders that the civil service would actually co - operate with a radical Labour government were largely laid to rest by the experience of the Attlee government .  But radicals in both parties who favoured radical changes ,  either to the left or to the right ,  have frequently condemned the civil service as the embodiment of an above - party consensus favouring continuity of policy .

By the late 1980s no African government could afford to neglect the significance of the sector for the employment of the hundreds of thousands of primary and secondary school leavers who were joining the labour market each year ,  and most were making policy statements which indicated some support for it .  However ,  it was also proving difficult to discard old attitudes .

Alhaji Abbo is a former truck driver who has successfully developed a 3,000 hectare maize farm and oil extraction plant in northern Cameroun .  In 1989 he was obliged to move out of his house to live on the farm in order to avoid the pressure to entertain visiting dignitaries on behalf of local politicians .  Thus whether the would - be efficient entrepreneur rises from the informal sector or parachutes into a larger - scale enterprise with a <head>degree</head> from an international business school , he will frequently be trapped into the same style of running a business as the Nigerian enterpreneurs described above . SMALL IS STILL BEAUTIFUL Entrepreneurs in pre - colonial Africa were effective in articulating trading relationships between Africa and the rest of the world ,  and in developing the productive activities which generated the trade .

There is good reason to ask to whom can the assets of the grain marketing board be sold ?  Yet the World Bank has continued to press this issue ,  at one stage moving the permanent secretary in the president 's  office to angrily rebuke the young leader of the Bank 's  team ,  and to the president himself being moved to recount to the team the Biblical story of the seven fat and seven lean years .

He was later to become suspicious of Maine 's  motives ,  however ,  as he was to see in the glorification of contract a subtle justification of the legal institutions of capitalism ,  and he was to seen in Maine 's  insistence on the primacy of the monogamous family an attempt to prove that this institution was beyond historical change .  In the same year the Swiss scholar ,  J. J. Bachofen ,  published Das Mutterrecht  ,   ( Mother Right )  ,  a book showing that matriliny ,  the tracing of descent through women ,  and matriarchy ,  the dominance of women in society ,  as well as the cult of female goddesses ,  preceded the patriarchy and the patriliny we find in Biblical and Classical societies .  This idea was accepted with varying <head>degrees</head> of caution by many nineteenth - century anthropologists and ultimately was wholly endorsed by Engels , who , in the preface to the fourth edition of The Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State , gave warm praise to Bachofen . Bachofen and Maine were soon followed by J. F. McLennan ,  a Scotsman whose work in part coincided with that of Bachofen and Maine but which developed much more the study of kinship systems .  This focus on kinship had an influence on both Marx and Engels which culminated in their enthusiasm for Lewis Henry Morgan whose two principal books had a decisive effect on their later work .

He does note ,  in the letter to Zasulich ,  Morgan 's  hope for a future society ,  which would abandon the obsession with private property ,  but at the same time he makes it clear that he rightly does not consider Morgan a socialist or a revolutionary .  Engels ,  on the other hand ,  states in the preface to the first edition of The Origin  that Morgan in his own way had discovered afresh in America the materialistic conception of history ,  discovered by Marx forty years ago ,  and in his comparison of barbarism and civilization it had led him ,  in the main points ,  to the same conclusions as Marx '  p. 71 .  This is high praise indeed from Engels but there is no hint in any of Marx 's own writing of that <head>degree</head> of endorsement for Morgan 's theoretical position . The Origin  falls into three parts .  The first ,  represented by Chapter 1 ,  deals with technological evolution .

The 2.5 - litre 90deg six ,  which was recently shown at Detroit 's  Society of Engineers show ,  produces a hefty 7500rpm and 184lb ft of torque at 5000rpm .  The all - alloy 24 - valve twin - cam engine is described by Cosworth as being of the high - efficiency type ,  and follows the modular theory  meaning that the basic design could suit anything from the three - cylinder unit to a V12 .  Using its patented Low Pressure Casting technique , Cosworth has been able to incorporate a high <head>degree</head> of stiffness in the compact unit . As a result ,  it will be suitable for both longitudinal or transverse settings ,  and can sit low in a chassis .  No manufacturer has yet committed itself to using the Cosworth engine ,  which is expected to be fully ready for production by June.

for alertness  ( or fatigue )  the evidence must be based upon subjective measurements ,  but ,  for body temperature ,  objective measurements are possible .  It will have been noted that the rhythms of body temperature and alertness are timed very similarly with higher values in the daytime and lower values at night  ( compare figs 1.2 and 1.3 )  .  This means that a higher body temperature is associated with a higher <head>degree</head> of alertness or a smaller amount of fatigue . The detailed explanation of what makes us feel alert is not known ,  but it is certain to be some function of brain activity ,  and brain activity increases with body temperature .  This is because enzymes  ( proteins that are responsible for carrying out the chemical processes within the body )  act more quickly as the temperature is raised .

The advantage of employing a specialist firm is that its tradesmen are more likely to be well trained and experienced in this field of building preservation ,  with a thorough and successful job being a more certain result .

They may have felt a <head>degree</head> of excitement as they turned their cameras on a train arriving at a station , waves crashing on the beach , or a group of workers emerging from their daily grind in the factory , but these early pieces of reportage were seen as nothing more than animated photographs , a further step in the development of photography . A little later ,  as filmmakers began to expend the medium 's  storytelling capacities ,  they drew from the techniques developed for the magic lantern or diorama and audiences saw a woman interrupting her husband in the act of kissing the maid ,  or a miller grappling with chimney sweeps in front of a windmill .  It was natural to see these moving pictures as nothing more than a novelty ,  perhaps merely a passing gimmick ;  they were ,  after all ,  only shown as an additional turn on the music - hall programme .

Its release had ,  however ,  been held up for some time on instructions from C. M. Woolf ,  a shrewd film salesman who had played a key role in financing the first projects of both Balcon and Wilcox .  The re - editing he demanded has generally been taken as evidence of just that Wardour Street backwardness to which Kine Weekly  alluded .  But while it 's true that Woolf 's disapproval of the film 's distinctive angles and extreme lighting contrasts does betray a <head>degree</head> of conservatism and , in his later campaign against The Man who Knew Too Much ( 1934 ) , he was clearly the enemy of anything even moderately original , Woolf was not a simple philistine . Brunel ,  no less committed than Hitchcock to an artistic direction for British films ,  was later unstinting in his praise of a man who by his faith and support set the pace at a time when we most needed it and credited him with contributing very considerably to the renaissance of the British film production industry .  Given that the re - editing of the film reduced the number of title cards from 300 to 80 ,  it is reasonable to assume that Woolf 's  intervention considerably improved the film ,  and that Woolf 's  commercial experience provided a valuable lesson both for Hitchcock and Balcon .

Miss Christine Murphy ,  a spokeswoman for the Public Health Laboratory Service  -  a Government - funded but independent organisation which also monitors levels of illness  said :  This year 's  virus is a sub - type of a strain we have seen before and many of the cases are not severe .  Children and young people are at greatest risk as the older element of the population who have experienced this before will have a <head>degree</head> of resistance . Vaccinations were recommended only for people at special risk .  The Queen was forced to cancel two engagements yesterday and another today because she has flu .

The decision whether or not to give directives involves the Home Secretary in making a delicate and difficult political judgment .

Mr Justice Simon Brown said he greatly preferred the approach adopted by Professor Jackson 's  tribunal .  It accorded with good sense and justice ,  and also properly reflected the important impact of the House of Lords '  decision in Shah v Barnet Borough Council 1983 2 AC 309 upon the statutory definition of settlement for Immigration Act purposes .  In Shah 's case Lord Scarman said , All that is necessary is that the purpose of living where one does eg , for education , employment , health , family or merely love of the place has a sufficient <head>degree</head> of continuity to be properly described as settled . Why should an applicant ,  who must in any event be prepared to satisfy the primary purpose test ,  be worse off because he contemplates the possibility of a relatively short stay in the UK than one who had the fixed intention of permanent UK residence ?  It was logical to construe the phrase intending to settle in rule 41 differently from the contrasting phrase admitted for settlement which appears elsewhere .

Although the boto is a powerful animal ,  and can sometimes tear its way out of nets ,  more often it becomes entangled and drowns .

According to Best and da Silva , the <head>degree</head> of hostility from commercial fishermen towards the boto is unquestionably growing . In the past this has been countered by the numerous superstitions of the indigenous peoples towards the river dolphins ,  but as the economic pressures of the commercial fishery become greater ,  these superstitions are likely to become less respected ,  especially by the younger fishermen .  Development pressures in the Amazon basin ,  such as the construction of hydro - electric dams ,  deforestation ,  and commercial fishing ,  have brought a flood of new settlers to the area .

According to his professor ,  he was thorough and conscientious rather than brilliant ,  taking his studies very seriously since he wanted both to improve himself and gain a qualification for when he finished playing .  It was during his second year at Manchester that he was offered the West Indies captaincy for the visit by Pakistan ,  but decided that his studies had to come first ;  he had a strong sense of predestination and apparently felt that the leadership would be his eventually .  Completing his <head>degree</head> would ensure that he was better equipped to do the job , especially as by studying social anthropology he would be better able to understand his players . Yet had the visitors been England or Australia he may well not have been able to resist the  temptation ,  and this was only partly because they were the leading lights in world cricket ;  there was also the racial aspect ,  in that he passionately wanted to prove that a team of black players led by a black captain was the equal of ,  if not better than ,  the white teams .  No doubt it is difficult for young people now to appreciate the complexities and the rigidities of the social structure in colonial days.
