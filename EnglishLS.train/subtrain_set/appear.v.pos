Garde  vue detention allows the police to detain suspects for interrogation for a period of up to 10 days. Recent information from former detainees ,  lawyers and human rights activists indicates that suspected political opponents of the government ,  including boys under 18 ,  have been detained in garde  vue well beyond the maximum 10 - day period and without obtaining further authorization after four days as required by Tunisian law. AI is concerned that the Tunisian Government , by its failure to investigate allegations of torture brought to its notice , <head>appears</head> to be condoning the use of torture . AI welcomed the formation by the Tunisian Government of an official human rights council on 9 April 1991 ,  although the organization remained concerned at continuing reports of torture and ill - treatment of political detainees in garde  vue detention .

Accusations continue of security force involvement in covert assassinations .  On March 27 ,  in Alexandra township outside Johannesburg ,  at least 14 people were killed when men armed with automatic weapons opened fire on mourners at a night - time vigil .  The police had been asked by the organizers of the vigil to provide protection after an incident earlier in the evening when about 200 suspicious - looking men <head>appeared</head> outside the house where the vigil was being held . According to those at the vigil ,  the police only checked on the hose twice before the massacre occurred at 4am .  The apparent failure of the police to act promptly and effectively ,  including their failure to apprehend a large group of armed men under conditions of curfew in the township creates the suspicion that police were colluding with the attackers .

German art historians had begun much more systematically on this task than others .  Several art historians wrote syntheses of art historical information ,  which became standard works .  Histories of art <head>appeared</head> in sequences of volumes by different authors , there were several series of books about artists and on museum collections , besides which the most comprehensive biographical dictionary of artists by Ulrich Thieme and Felix Becker started its long publication process in 1907 . Roger Fry acknowledged German scholarship as a precursor of serious art historical studies in this century .  Fry was a connoisseur of Renaissance art ,  but also he defended Post - Impressionism  ( a term he invented )  ,  was a painter ,  and published a monograph on Czanne .

Giacometti was an artist with very different artistic aims ,  clearly expounded by Valerie J. Fletcher in a catalogue for an exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden ,  Washington ,  in 1988 .  Writing about a small bust on a column ,  a thin sculpture in a series of four busts of which the others were fuller in form ,  she comments that the extremely thin proportions of the head contrast with the solidity of the base .  So delicately modulated are the forms of the head that the human element <head>appears</head> ephemeral . This tenuous fragility contrasts with the three later busts on a stele ,  which have substantial anatomical forms .  The sculptor had decided that he wanted this bust to confront the observer .

The catalogue has the additional interest of a memoir by Silvio Berthoud ,  who had sat as a boy between five and eight for his uncle :  I have very unpleasant recollections of sitting for him ,  for it was of utmost importance not to move but to fix him right in the eye and listen to him complain ,  saying as he always did that he was getting nowhere .

These examples of catalogues containing helpful art criticism could be contrasted with many others which are limited to lists of exhibitions ,  details of the artist 's  career ,  and entries for the works displayed .  There are other hazards for the readers of catalogues .  Some publications are less impartial than they might <head>appear</head> , erring on the side of generosity . Museums with exhibitions of art from other countries are especially likely to be respectful in commentaries on works of art which have been borrowed .  All the same ,  museum curators will have carried out a critical task in selecting the exhibition ,  in some instances having fended off proposals for inclusions with a political or a particular cultural bias .

A case of unwitting collusion by a critic in a manoeuvre by an art  dealer occurred in 1961 ,  when Leo Steinberg wrote an article about Jasper Johns .  Johns was a puzzling phenomenon for Steinberg ,  as one of the artists of Pop Art ,  then hardly begun .  The article <head>appeared</head> in an Italian magazine Metro , who had intended to pay 300 for an article ; but when Johns ' dealer , Leo Castelli , knew that Steinberg was considering an article , he arranged for the magazine to offer 1,000 , paying the difference of 700 himself . Steinberg knew nothing about it .  The underlying question for a reader of criticism is what influences are exerted on the critic ;  but as in this instance ,  for long it may be impossible to know the truth .

The only virtue of these latter newspaper techniques is to bring an event to the attention of a reader .  A solo exhibition can vary in scope from the minimum ,  that is to say a show of recent work ,  through a more extended selection to the apogee of a retrospective exhibition .  We have already looked at writing in catalogues , and can now turn our attention to the critical responses which <head>appear</head> in articles . The scope or character of a piece of criticism is naturally related to the magazine or newspaper in which it appears ,  as we noticed in the case of Dore Ashton 's  dismissal from the New York Times  because it was asserted that her work could not be understood by the paper 's  readers .  The first rule for a reader of articles is thus to find a sympathetic publication .

They subsequently developed individual styles and separate interests ,  as is true of most groups of artists ,  but their initial appearance was defined by a programme .  Another sort of title for a group is exemplified by Der Blaue Reiter   ( The Blue Rider )  .  Forty - three works by fourteen painters were shown in 1911 at the First Exhibition by the Editorial Board of The Blue Rider , the publication concerned being an almanac which <head>appeared</head> in 1912 with a drawing of a horseman by Kandinsky on the cover . The second exhibition included thirty - one artists .

English fiction loves such people ;  it never tires of the lurch ,  of such areas of darkness .  Salim 's  outlook incorporates a version of that of his friend Indar ,  who teaches in the polytechnic for a while ,  and lends himself to the philanthropic white - liberal cultivation of the African experience ,  where some of the best comedy in the book is located .

The affair seems to him to belong to the town ,  to have no future ,  and they are parted when the town comes under fear and hazard .

But the fit of jealousy in which he beats her would <head>appear</head> to mean something more than these words of explanation enable one to understand . This jealousy may be felt to be like Othello 's  in having more to do with difference of race ,  and with the jealousies of race ,  than  the jealous man ,  or than the work he belongs to ,  seems disposed to state .

Patrician insolence has quite often <head>appeared</head> to express a perception of the activities of the levelling Labour governments which have come and gone since 1945 .

In all this sharp distinguishing ,  in all this enemy thing that Amis has ,  there are elements of anxiety ,  and of misrepresentation .  Many of the actions performed by many women , according to the misogynists he likes to write about , are performed by many men , and many ugly people would <head>appear</head> to be just as happy , and just as emotionally fulfilled , as many lovely ones .

It is a distinction which may in the end prove more suggestive than serviceable :  the author who tells ,  and who can be accounted something of a ventriloquist ,  may well ,  for instance ,  be more than capable of carnival ,  and may even be every bit as plural in his works as his dialogic counterpart .  But it is possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lies at the heart of it may be successfully applied both to some sorts of contemporary author and to some of what went before .

At the same time ,  he accepts the obvious fact that facts are never just coming at you but are incorporated by an imagination that is formed by your previous experience .  At the end of the book ,  though ,  Zuckerman confronts Roth with the opinion that the latter has made a mistake in trying to tame or to shed his imagination in the foregoing text ,  that fiction is superior to fact ,  and that the factuality of The Facts  is specious .  Roth would <head>appear</head> to believe both the claim and the counter - claim as to the value of the text , and to believe , too , both that the Roth part of the book does not represent an exercise of the imagination and that it does .

But he is also a writer of remarkable ability who has managed to capture and to keep the readership he has bewildered and delighted and offended ,  and whose work is strong in an intelligent and generous - hearted awareness of public matters ,  some of them quite remote from the Family Roth :  The Counterlife  ,  for instance ,  carries a telling serio - comic critique of the hard line in Israel ,  the Israeli toughness ,  that refuses to give ground .  In The Facts  he examines his own vexed state with reference to the vexed question of whether it is better to make things up ,  and to distort them ,  and by contemplating his earlier re - invention of the time - honoured dualistic account of literature and human nature .

This is reminiscent of the sort of inversion a fault - finding literary criticism can produce  which is not to deny ,  which is indeed to admit ,  that the Arab leaders and polemicists of the region have had their faults ,  including some of those which have been identified over the years by Commentary  .

Let us praise ,  more than we do ,  and as we can here ,  the literal writer .  But there is no doing so unless we accept that the literal writer has an imagination .  Levi can sometimes <head>appear</head> incapable of fiction , but it is no less apparent that everything he wrote was fiction . He was well - aware of the sense in which he made up what happened to him ,  imagined his misfortune .  In calling his recent book about his own early life by the name of The Facts  ,  Philip Roth is issuing a challenge  expecting his readers to know that there are no bare facts ,  and obliging them to think hard about what happens in the recounting of the facts of a life .

The shortest stories in Greyhound for Breakfast  owe a lot to Kafka 's  briefer parables ,  though they are apt to be more difficult to understand ;  and there can be no doubt that Beckett 's  solipsistic tramps have left an impression on the earlier writings .

Over the same period ,  the Church of Ireland experienced continuing rounds of church closures and became top - heavy in numbers of clergy .

Southern protestants do not <head>appear</head> to be particularly oppressed by the state ( White 1975 : 169 ) , but they would clearly change aspects of the constitution and legislation if they were in a position to do so .

The occasional independent unionist and independent Orange - lodge representative in politics were a feature of politics from 1880 to 1972 .

It is important to note that in 191214 the protestant  loyalist group saw their right to violence as prior to that of the official state .  It is also important to note that they saw the taking of law into their own hands as temporary ,  and pending the recognition by that state of its mistaken attitude towards them and their right to a degree of autonomy .  It <head>appears</head> to be increasingly the case that there are two major traditions of identity perception among protestant loyalists . One tradition is the covenant one and is antagonistic to a straightforward nationalist sentiment .  It is adhered to by increasing numbers who have become disillusioned with British identity and have seen Paisley 's  words about the traitorous nature of British governments become reality as protestant  loyalist domination in Ulster has been continuously eroded .

However ,  that myth is not quite the one which appears to have penetrated everyday life ,  perhaps because the place of the victory is located within the borders of the Southern state .

However ,  the earthly role of the community ,  be it protestant or catholic ,  is not seen as secondary to the religious message ,  but as either in continuity with or against it .  The Calvinist vision of an earthly city in which pastor and politician work in harmony to exclude evil from the lives of all those within the city walls remains a religious outlook for a significant number of protestant loyalists .  This is a totalizing view of society , and implies a certain anti - pluralism : freedom of belief and action within certain parameters , which are to be decided either by those who <head>appear</head> righteous in the sight of God or by those who , at least , conform in their lawmaking to the advice given to them by the righteous . The very drift of the account of Christian myth and religious political ethics has certain parallels of structure with the siege of Londonderry .  These should be noted ,  before one views the siege as baseline myth for the interpretation of everyday life .

Generally speaking ,  there is evidence that the church has always tended to support the hegemony of the state qua  state .  It supported the British state for most of the nineteenth century in Ireland ,  then supported constitutional politics for home rule ;  and when independence came in 1921 ,  it supported the pro - treaty faction in Southern Ireland and opposed the civil war because that faction was the state .  It would <head>appear</head> that the popular religious consciousness makes a distinction between violence against the Southern state , whose statehood cannot be questioned , and violence for liberation in the North . Though the extent to which such a consciousness exists is not clear ,  one aspect of it is beyond dispute :  35 per cent of McGreil 's  random sample of Dubliners and 46 per cent of the males in the sample ,  including a spread from the younger age groups and the more educated ,  supported the view that the use of violence ,  while regrettable ,  has been necessary for the achievement of non - Unionist rights  ( Mc Gril 1977 :  387 )  .  In any event ,  there is likely to be significant variation in views as to how far one should condemn or condone this liberationist violence in the North .

As has already been seen ,  it was the style of both church and politicians to avoid their mutual consultations being known ,  which tells us that the secularity of the state at that time was partially a faade ,  but one which it was felt by both interested parties had to be maintained ,  probably so as not to confuse the faithful .  In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 ,  while an extensive health bill was going through parliament ,  the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority ,  without qualification ,  is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family ,  the Church in education ,  the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions  (  Irish Independent  ,  12 Apr. 1951 ,  quoted Whyte 1980 :  143 )  .  It <head>appeared</head> that one of the main sources of the bishops ' opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation . That the bishops were  affected by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme  clearly they stood to lose money and independence if such a scheme were implemented  seems likely .  Whereas similar provisions in other countries were mainly designed to provide facilities which could or could not be used ,  the Irish ones were to be compulsory and there was to be no choice of doctor .

Later the hierarchy made it clear that the basis for their objections was the increase in power by the state vis -  - vis  the liberty and self - reliance of its citizens which such legislation would entail .  Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the whole affair is the way Dr Browne handled it .  The members of his party <head>appeared</head> to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the earlier Bill , and Dr Browne only found out in October/November 1950 . When he was told of the hierarchy 's  opposition to any bill of this kind ,  Dr Browne ,  himself secularly inclined ,  submitted his proposals and arguments to the hierarchy for approval ,  just as a previous Health Minister ,  Dr Walsh ,  had consulted Archbishop McQuaid on a similar matter in 1946 .  If a man of such convictions felt it necessary to follow this course ,  how much more would have his religiously  devoted colleagues .

On the one hand ,  the laity would not understand the complexity of the issues because of their poor understanding of Christian doctrine and the intricacies of morality ;  on the other ,  the area of the sacred in the political arena was clearly defined ,  and clear guidance from the clerical church was both necessary and expected by good Christian politicians .  What the bishops and the politicians had come up against in the Mother and Child controversy was that this paternalistic conceptualization was intrinsically at odds with the common understanding of democracy .  This <head>appears</head> to be the first contradiction which the bishops later sought to resolve by withdrawing from the direct contact method . It indicates that a real change did eventually take place after all ,  in so far as freedom of information and the inappropriateness of direct consultation without public mediation eventually became accepted as something which ,  at worst ,  had to be risked and something which ,  at best ,  formed an essential task of the construction of a Christian conscience in a Christian society .  This ,  however ,  was the only contradiction which appears to have been solved by the 1960s .

The fact that it was not long after that similar if lesser welfare legislation was introduced is indicative of the public demand and that clerical socio - moral theory did not tally with the people 's  experience of reality .

Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate ,  they meant they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state .  But they did and still do remain the authoritative conscience of the nation .  In addition , the clergy <head>appear</head> to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships , doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues . Part of the overall argument of this book is that ,  as the Roman catholic church is principal validator or legitimator of the Southern state along with the concept of the national entity ,  what that state goes on to do in the field of social ethics cannot be separated out from the responsibilities of the church .  This structural link between politics and religion is underlined by the legitimacy the church gives to the state as a whole ,  by recognizing it simply as society .

Caught between the preaching of the Roman catholic clergy and appeals from protestants and liberal Roman catholics  including Dr FitzGerald  not to constitutionalize the issue ,  it would appear that many voters simply stayed away rather than vote against the proposal .

While preparing an early draft of the present chapter ,  the writer heard Bishop Cathal Daly of Down and Connor ,  a leading moderate among the bishops ,  respected by all except PIRA ,  repeat the adage that the Irish constitution was secular ,  implying that there really was little to be done for the moment .

The Divorce Debate Almost as if to test the political religious alliance of catholic nationalists in the South ,  the constitutional issue of divorce arose in 1986 as part of Dr Garret FitzGerald 's  constitutional crusade  ( see Cooney 1986 )  to make the Southern state more palatable to Northerners .

There seemed to be the fairly uncomplicated desire among the community to see all the children attend the same school ,  as an expression of relationships existing within the community .

The children probably <head>appear</head> as a source from which to develop new relationships and the immediate perception is to translate this experience into scholastic terms . The absence of a non - Roman catholic school in the immediate area and the nave belief that they were empowered in some way to have a say in what type of school should appear on their housing estate  there was a small Roman catholic school which was to be expanded to cater for the growth of the population  may have sharpened catholic parents '  interest in having an integrated school .

But where other churches have owned their own schools ,  as does the Church of Ireland in the South ,  a similar position has been adopted ,  though the reasons for the position have been on different grounds .  A proposal before the Church of Ireland synod in May 1979 to support interdenominational education was defeated ,  despite pressure from its ecumenical lobby .  The main grounds <head>appeared</head> to be the danger which it might pose to the small Southern protestant minority by encouraging mixed marriages . However ,  no evidence favouring such a contention has ever been produced .  Harry MacAdoo ,  then the Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin ,  on several occasions put forward the argument that Southern protestants were a minority group with their own culture and traditions ,  and thus deserved to have schools for themselves in order to hand on their own traditions .

This attitude was amply revealed in the results of the competition  ( Inside the Pub )  launched jointly by The Architectural Review   and The Brewers '  Society in 1949 .

Contemporary design , the magazine 's editor regretted , because it has no roots in the vernacular idiom will not <head>appear</head> immediately familiar , whilst the mock - Tudor and the mock - Georgian styles which have been so prevalent no matter how misguided in themselves have sprung from a genuine attempt to preserve a traditional atmosphere .

The response of the 1960s and 70s to this failure to capture the essence of the traditional pub was the ruthlessly - applied corporate image and the proliferation of fun theme - pubs .

The current obsession with pseudo - Victorian and other bogus historical styles imposed willy - nilly and quite regardless of the true age of the pub ,  seems to suggest two things ;  firstly that pub designers and fitters have completely lost their way ,  both in recognising and respecting what is genuinely old and in looking for a wholeheartedly modern pub style ;  secondly that there is   some  king  of awareness ,  correct but misguided ,  that people like their pubs to look old and feel familiar .  The great pity of this is that most pubs are   old ,  yet the proper opportunity to celebrate this has already been squandered .   There <head>appears</head> to be no creative public vision which will help the survival of the pub or help ensure a healthy and varied pub stock . History ,  indeed ,  tends to show that public intervention can have the effect of reinforcing rather than curbing market excesses .  It was the licensing system and licensing controls ,  after all ,  which helped to foster Britain 's  peculiar brewery tie and concentrate pub ownership in the hands of the brewers in the first place ;  and it was the same system which connived at and partly encouraged the modern contagion of open - plan pub designs .

By 1830 the pub had become comparatively sophisticated ,  responding to the changing demands and the technological advances of the industrial revolution .

Modern serving equipment including beer machines and even slop trays had <head>appeared</head> . And the bar on which they stood had evolved from a simple counter or hatch to something approaching the form we know today :  in his Encyclopaedia of Cottage ,  Farm and Villa Architecture   of 1833 J C Loudon described the ideal bar  ( the place from which all orders are issued )  as being of some size ,  with commanding views of the front entrance hall and back entrance .  By the end of the Regency period the pub was becoming a far more attractive proposition for the government ,  too .

Despite what brewers '  architects often allege ,  the life expectancy of such plastic window units is proving remarkably short  as little as five years for the fittings ,  and twenty years for the plastic itself ,  which is exhibiting distinct tendencies to warp and discolour with age .  Thus the arguments for easier maintenance and greater longevity of plastic windows <head>appear</head> to have little foundation in fact an argument often ignored by the brewers . Given their prime location in the centre of towns and on major thoroughfares ,  Georgian coaching inns are frequently prime targets for refurbishment .  Such redevelopment is often unnecessary and detrimental ;  the end product of such schemes is all too often a sham - historical parody ,  re - creating an idealised ,  sanitised Britain that never actually existed .

RUTH WATSON Fox and Goose ,  Fressingfield ,  Near Diss ,  Norfolk .   LEISURE DESIGN IS IMPORTANT WHY is it that hotel owners and operators put so much emphasis on recruiting professional hotel designers to create the right hotel , but , when it comes to the inclusion of leisure facilities , then they <head>appear</head> to approach any designer , with the impression that it can be addressed from a design viewpoint just like any other area ? In fact the leisure facility is a minefield of safety ,  legal ,  and operational problems that ,  unless addressed in a professional manner ,  can cause catastrophic consequences .  It is often said that the two most difficult and specialist design areas within a hotel are the kitchen and the leisure facility .

Let me .  I 'm his cousin ,  Peter Horbury .  The Hon. Peter Horbury <head>appeared</head> to be some ten or twelve years younger than the earl . There were traces of the same fine - boned look about him ,  but his features were already well masked by what was likely in the course of time to become a solid layer of self - indulgent fat .  Nevertheless he seemed willing enough to accompany the Finnish detective in the dangerous climb down over the tumbling rocks to where his cousin and his cousin 's  pretty ,  peroxided fiance lay .

The poire or ,  in English ,  pear is an obvious subliminal  reference to the distinctive shape of the detective 's  bald head .  That shape is again shadowed in the French word poire ,  which means white beet and conforms with the frequently - mentioned pallor of the detective 's  complexion .  Though poireau , the French word closest in sound to the name Christie chose , with its double meanings of leek and wart , <head>appears</head> to have no obvious connection with the detective , the word poirier , meaning a pear - tree offers a much more fruitful area for investigation . Its sound provided the first syllable of Poirot 's  name poir ,  and for the second one need look no further than the French word perdreau ,  meaning a young partridge .  The unusual juxtaposition of these two words can only be a subconscious association in the author 's  mind with the well - known carol ,  The Twelve Days of Christmas  whose repetitive chorus ends ,  And a partridge in a pear - tree .

She made several women 's  films for Rank ,  including STREET CORNER  ( 1953 )  about the women police in Chelsea ,  which she always cited as a particularly enjoyable experience since it involved working with a mainly female crew and cast .  Another outstanding Box feature was SIMON AND LAURA  ( 1956 )  a comedy about live television production starring Kay Kendall and Peter Finch whose wit and sharpness has not since been rivalled by films on similar themes .  Her films are by no means as simple as they may have first <head>appeared</head> . They make deceptively subtle demands on their audience ,  and through all of them there runs a strong sense of humour .  Her last film RATTLE OF A SIMPLE MAN  ( 1964 )  whose commercial and critical failure ended her career ,  can be seen as a woman 's  reply to the eulogies of the working class male celebrated by John Osbourne and his like ,  and it does so by poking fun at the ideology of the male and his crude sexism .

Another solution is to dig a hole in the garden ,  place the bowls in this ,  and cover them with a thick layer of leaf mould ,  peat or peat substitute ,  but the bowls must have drainage holes or they could become waterlogged during heavy rainfall .

If every type of glider required a different recovery there would be the risk of a pilot using the wrong method for the type of aircraft .  All gliders and light aircraft have to recover satisfactorily with the standard method .  This is not to say that other methods would not work , but it is unwise to use non - standard methods for recovery from a fully developed spin , even if they <head>appear</head> to work better . In the standard recovery ,  the full opposite rudder is always applied first ,  and if it does slow down the rotation ,  the nose of the glider will automatically drop ,  helping to unstall the wings .  In this way the rudder is a very powerful influence on the spin recovery because it helps the pitching movement and also slows the rotation .

A chief constable is perfectly entitled to insist on being informed when a member of his force writes to the press on matters appertaining to his force .  The Disciplinary Code in Schedule 1 to the Police  ( Discipline )  Regulations 1985 contains an offence of improper disclosure of information ,  which is committed where a member of a police force without proper authority communicates to any person ,  any information which he has in his possession as a member of a police force .  This does not apply to matters of general interest , although some senior officers <head>appear</head> to have strange interpretations of their own . ( Police Review  26 August 1988 :  1797 )  Of course ,  the desire to obtain control of the written word has always been one indication of the autocratic mind .

In an interview with Mark Paytress in 1988 Leonard stated that by the age of six he was already acquainted with rudimentary Judaism and recalled being deeply touched by the stirring language and imagery of the Bible  -  in English and Hebrew .  Each day after school he would wend his way to the synagogue for instruction in the sacred scriptures ,  the stories and history of his people ,  which reached its climax in 1946 ,  when Leonard was made A son of the law. All hell rules over the man who is angry , says the Talmud , and by September 1939 , when Leonard was beginning to come to terms with the thresholds of life 's reality , hell was ruling the world , or at least <head>appeared</head> to be . War had been declared ,  and the fate of Czechoslovakia ,  Austria and Poland was sealed ,  as it would be for several other countries .  It would be six years before that anger would begin to subside ,  six years of unspeakable anguish for those of Hebrew persuasion ,  when unbelievable monstrosities would be inflicted on them ,  by the end of which half of the world 's  Jewry had been murdered .

A much more likely explanation of Libet 's  findings is simply that all experiences are delayed relative to the stimulus causing them ,  so that synchronous external events produce synchronous experiences .  ( Another useful illusion is that of the instantaneity of experience .  We have to view a stimulus for a finite time before it generates a perception , but that perception <head>appears</head> to us to occur instantaneously rather than fading into view like the Cheshire cat . ) But there is no way we can test for this hypothetical delay .  Subjects are always limited to making judgements about experiences ;  experimenters are stuck with observing physical events like evoked potentials ,  verbal reports and button presses .

You could ask PH to introspect into the contents of his phenomenological awareness when he is looking at faces for as long as you liked ,  but there would be no insight that any recognition is occurring .  That PH is genuinely recognizing faces ,  however ,  cannot be seriously questioned .  This pattern of findings would <head>appear</head> to be impossible to accommodate from the viewpoint of phenomenology . As Bauer put it in a recent BBC television discussion of covert recognition ,  Our normal experience of perception ,  of seeing objects or faces as an all or none process ,  is a trick that the brain plays on us .  It is a trick that should no longer fool anyone except phenomenologists .

These were eventually formalized in the Weber - Fechner law which reported a quantitative relationship between stimulus and subjective experience ,  the sensation increasing in proportion to the logarithm of the magnitude of the physical stimulus .  A quantitative correlation between the objective intensity of stimulus and the pattern of neural activity was subsequently demonstrated by physiologists recording from individual fibres .  Since the work of S. S. Stevens in the 1930s and later , it has been recognized that , although the Weber - Fechner Law holds for many sorts of sensory experience , the exponent varies widely ; nevertheless , the principle of a quantitative correlation between external stimulus , neural activity and experienced sensation remains intact and now <head>appears</head> to be well - established . So much for the basic laws .  The repeated confirmation of the correlation between the physical characteristics of the stimulus and the characteristics of the neural activity it triggers ,  and between the characteristics of the stimulus and that of the subjective sensation ,  has encouraged the belief that our sensations are in some sense to be understood in terms of a set of stimulation levels  ( spiking frequencies )  in the appropriate sensory pathways .

Castello is a wood in which the markings are usually very distinct ,  consisting of stripes of light and dark wood ,  varying in width and of a wavy character .

Don't forget that the sun will always <head>appear</head> behind the stripy cloud , never in front of it ; clouds can do either but probably look best with the stripes as a background . Certain samples of walnut can be similarly used giving a rather more dramatic and somewhat stormy appearance to a design .

A number of the 150 people who have contacted Age Concern England about the debt they face took up their scheme before this date and will not be able to obtain compensation even if they are granted an award through arbitration or private legal action .  Sally Greengross ,  Director of Age Concern England ,  has written to the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators urging that awards made by arbitrators should enable investors to escape their debt completely ,  ie to pay off the whole of their outstanding loan ,  which will otherwise roll up on a daily basis ,  in some cases leading to repossession .

A recent DSS Housing Benefit/Community Charge Benefit circular has given guidance about the treatment of income which is paid at intervals other than one week .  Where income such as an occupational pension or Retirement Pension is paid into a bank or building society account on ,  for example ,  a monthly or four - weekly basis ,  in some cases this has been treated as capital resulting in a possible reduction of benefit .  In effect it <head>appears</head> that the pension has been assessed both as income and capital . The circular states that income to cover a certain period should be ignored as capital for that period .  For example if a person who has 3,000 capital receives a monthly pension of 200 paid into their bank account ,  this should not be assessed as an increase in savings unless it remains unspent at the time the next payment is due .

This may well be more economic in costs to the GP budget or DHA involved ,  but could well create considerable extra cost for the person and his or her family ,  both in terms of travelling to and from hospital and in loss of support from friends and relatives who may not be able to visit .

Almost half of the serviceable BR - owned wagon fleet in 1989 comprised merry - go - round coal hoppers ,  with the remainder consisting largely of steel carriers ,  some vans and opens for general merchandise traffic ,   and  rather surprisingly and after much argument with the industry  the fleet of china clay carriers built to replace the venerable clay hoods in 1988 .

The MiniLink and MaxiLink container systems , both of which <head>appeared</head> in 1987 , incorporated some novel design features which enabled road - rail transfer without the need for separate lifting equipment . An even more exciting development was TrailerTrain ,  comprising a specially profiled road trailer which could be loaded on to railway bogies ,  again without the need for fixed equipment at the transfer location .  Finally ,  one of the best kept secrets of the decade until its unveiling in 1988 was the Redland self - discharge aggregates train ,  a permanently coupled set of hopper wagons with a conveyor belt running underneath and a special unloading vehicle at one end .

Added to that was the desire to eradicate all vehicles with asbestos insulation by 1988 ,  a target not in fact achieved .

This required a knowledge of the theory of numbers and geometrical design ,  of singing and playing some musical instrument ,  of composing poems ,  of dancing ,  fencing and sword play ,  as well as of practising the fashionable sports and pastimes .

The same types of generalised character continued and still <head>appeared</head> in Petipa 's many ballets , Fokine 's Pavillon d'Armide , Ashton 's Cinderella and MacMillan 's Romeo and Juliet . There are some glimpses of the same behaviour in MacMillan 's  Mayerling  ,  although the manners and behaviour have deteriorated .

It can be that magic moment in such dances as the Rose Adage in The  Sleeping Beauty  when Aurora triumphantly raises her hand from the fourth Prince 's  grasp and holds the final attitude  for several seconds revealing her complete command over the forces of gravity .  There are hundreds of instances of this kind of pose created by many different choreographers .  There is the moment in the Act II pas de deux or Swan Lake where Odette <head>appears</head> to fly away in an arabesque before Siegfried seizes her arms and draws her body close to his in an embrace . There are also the exciting poses that come at the end of some of Ashton 's  pas de deux  as the two characters declare their love ,  for example ,  when Oberon cradles Titania in his arms at the end of The Dream  and ,  even more excitingly ,  when Colas lifts Lise high on one arm it the end of their dance in Act II of La Fille Mai Garde  as if to crown her queen of the harvest In some modern classical ballets too little attention is paid to the momentary holding of a pose as the focus of a picture to sum up  as it were  what has gone before .

Anyone using steel backs to their shoes can still do this .  There is no light and shade and this way of using the pointes  has nothing to do with giving a finishing touch to such dances as those fur Petipa 's  Aurora and the Six Fairies in The Sleeping Beauty  to make them seem lighter than air .  Nor does it resemble the bravura footing of Kitri in the Don Quixote pas de deux or the passages in Ashton 's Ondine where his ballerina <head>appears</head> to be floating through water . Nor can it be compared with the ballerina 's  dance in Rhapsodie  where she wafts to and fro as if in a dream before breaking into her solo .  The spacing of such steps on pointe  is so minute and so fast that it is not possible to see the change of feet as one succeeds the other.

when the members of the newly founded french academies laid down rules for all artists at the court of Louis XIV ,  they had to conform whether they were painters ,  sculptors or designers of scenery ,  props and tapestries .  The rules stated that artistic works had to be inspired by the ancient Greek arts ,  be symmetrical ,  properly proportioned and balanced round a centre .  These edicts were particularly important for all concerned in the opera - ballets in which the king himself frequently <head>appeared</head> at the climax of the action . To prove his importance and so that his entrance was emphasised all entered in order of precedence .  He was thus the focus for all performers as well as spectators .

From such ideas he formed dances which did away with pointes  but retained much of the classical footwork which he co - ordinated with the less familiar action of the arms and hands .  Thus the angular and straight lines drawn by the legs were also drawn simultaneously by the arms and hands ,  which were allowed to cross the centre line of the body ,  very often with a twist sideways at the waist .  This made the dancers <head>appear</head> as if they were a moving frieze . Something that David Bintley was also to achieve later in his Sons of Horus   ( 1985 )  .  Ashton too has created two oriental styled ballets in which the delicacy of the hands and arms drew attention to the way such subtle movements can take the place of words .

At this time a MacMillan ballet was expected to be ,  above all ,  about dancing .

Military style  Today very little military demi - caractre  style exists in Western ballet except in such American works as Balanchine 's  Stars and Stripes  ,  but it played a large part during the nineteenth century .  It was then taken over by such excellent troupes as the Tiller and Jackson Girls who toured widely over Europe and America and later by the Drum Majorettes , who have also <head>appeared</head> in Balanchine 's works . One glimpse of this welldisciplined style can be seen in Lichine 's  Graduation Ball  ,  where both boys and girls march in formation and make other military manoeuvres .  It is this aspect of military style that is well worth studying for the precision with which a battalion of soldiers makes patterns such as can be seen at the British ceremony of Trooping the Colour .

Ashton looks back to Petipa 's  more formal style because it is suitable for Mendelssohn 's  music .  Despite Puck 's  wild leaps ,  crazy antics and turns ,  the clumsy attempts by the Mechanicals to cut capers and Bottom 's  efforts sur les pointes  ,  it is Oberon and Titania 's  dancing that commands the stage as well as those trapped in the magicked Athenian wood .  from their first confrontation , when Titania <head>appears</head> wilfully aloof as Oberon tries to exert his authority , to their final reconciliation , they stand out as a true Fairy King and Queen , who are not beyond suffering the moods and emotions of We mortals here .

It is worth noting that such important modern choreographers as Kurt Jooss and Martha Graham and the leader of the Dance Theatre of Harlem ,  George Mitchell ,  insisted that their dancershave knowledge of some school of classical technique ,  to which they added other exercises to develop the flexibility of their dancers '  bodies ,  athletic qualities and an ability to explore more thoroughly the space around them in all its dimensions .  The additional exercises certainly led to a greater use of patterns made by the dancers rolling or posturing over and on the floor .  This gave greater depth to most of the patterns , but often made the dancers <head>appear</head> earthbound . It also led to closer contacts between the dancers as they moved from picture to picture within the design .  From time to time this can be very beautiful but because there is a lack of continuity in the dance movement from one picture to the next ,  the resultant work often appears static .

Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes  in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints ,  thus the dancers '  bodies mostly face the audience but their arms and legs turn inwards and are seen mostly in profile .

Those of the arms are particularly interesting because the fists are either clenched or the fingers flattened thus the lines and shapes made only <head>appear</head> slightly rounded by the folds in the sleeves .

In the last chapter ,  in prison ,  he says that without the crime he would not have found within himself such  questions ,  desires ,  feelings ,  needs ,  strivings ,  and development .  Were he to say any such thing we would be left with a therapeutic murder .  But again Dostoevsky is fumbling after a creative or regenerative suffering , because it is of the essence of Raskolnikov 's questions , desires , feelings , and so forth ( which of course do <head>appear</head> in the novel ) that they should be agonized . The fictional morphology of this suffering is more aptly suggested by the novelist and critic Akhsharumov ,  writing the very year Crime and Punishment  appeared in hard covers ,  who observes that Raskolnikov 's  mental torment ,  which is  his punishment in all but its public aspect ,  begins with his first promptings towards the crime .  Thus Akhsharumov directs the reader to something that makes him certain he holds a masterpiece in his hands before he has read half a dozen pages :  a single pre - natal life ,  a foetal stirring and growth ,  no ordinary robust narrative sense of something afoot .

We do .  He is just surprised .  On the surface of his mind lies the contrast between a trivial though tormenting fear and a monstrous scheme ; and beneath that contrast <head>appears</head> a positive contradiction : for a few sentences earlier we have been told He was not really afraid of any landlady . The question ,  who tells us ?  ,  recalls the most important of Dostoevsky 's  many changes in the course of writing Crime and Punishment  ,  his switch from first - person narration  the murderer 's  story  to what is formally third - person but proves so supple ,  so volatile ,  that the distinction between the inside and outside of Raskolnikov 's  head disappears when his creator wants it to .  The solution to He was not really afraid of any landlady might appear to be that we have here a masked first - person avowal ,  and that it is simply an indication of Dostoevsky 's  boldness that it should be surrounded by authorial statements which are firmly outside and  ( so to say )  on top of Raskolnikov in the classical omniscient third - person mode :  for example ,  information about his poverty ,  irritable frame of mind ,  withdrawal from society ,  his not naturally timorous and abject disposition .

Being gripped by a narrative is an altogether wider notion than what is presaged by the two - in - one of being outside yet inside Raskolnikov 's  strange smile :  the rehearsal of the murder ,  the murder sequence itself ,  the three long duels with the detective Porfiry ,  the suffering ,  the hesitation ,  the final climb up the police - station stairs .  Dostoevsky 's  own attempt to suggest how he disposes his reader in relation to these events goes as follows :  Narration by the author ,  a sort of invisible but omniscient being who nevertheless does n't leave him meaning his hero ' for a moment So , after <head>appearing</head> to settle for third - person narrative , he doubles back on himself and leaves us to make what we can of an omniscient author who is bound hand and foot to a far from omniscient protagonist . That he succeeds in having it both ways is our experience of reading his novel in its dominant and thriller aspect .  His Petersburg counts for an awful lot .

And that is how the passage <head>appeared</head> in volume form , in the editions of 1867 and 1870 . But in 1877 ,  the last text overseen by the novelist ,  as if spoken to himself becomes as if meant for himself ,  shifting and refining nuance while involving the change of a single word in Russian ,  and enabling the artist to get at last the effect he had been working towards .

( iv )  Among Crime and Punishment 's   major characters only Porfiry the detective is in no sense an arriver .  It will <head>appear</head> mechanical , when plucked out of the huge and vital narrative flow , that Dostoevsky has given him a sickly dark yellow complexion as a mark of his belonging to Petersburg . Nevertheless he does possess a yellow face as opposed to lodging in a yellow room ,  or handling yellow money ,  or being issued  ( the bureaucracy !  )  with a yellow ticket .  He also belongs for the reason suggested by Svidrigailov ;  Petersburg is the administrative centre of Russia ,  and Porfiry occupies his position there as an official examining magistrate within the metropolitan and national legal system .

The word appears twice in Dostoevsky 's  letter to Katkov outlining Crime and Punishment  ,  in the phrase unsteadiness of ideas  which is natural since a drama of reflection is about to unfold :  thinking is Raskolnikov 's  work ,  as he tells the maid Nastasya .  Unsteady work ,  we might add .  Moreover the surname Shatov <head>appears</head> once in the notebooks relating to Crime and Punishment . But nothing further .  It 's  as if the name were waiting for the man ,  and for the novel which will transpersonalize or socialize the murderous concept :  social unsteadiness ,  as Shatov says and as we read in the Possessed  notebooks .

In the earlier Possessed notebooks Granovsky <head>appears</head> under his own name , and Peter Verkhovensky ( it must be recorded ) is often Nechaev . The tendentious story would soon be out of the way ,  making possible a return to what Dostoevsky thought was much more important ,  the Life of a Great Sinner  project .

But on the contrary ,  this world of it was rumoured and that may well have been so followed at once by it is more likely that nothing of the sort happened  again in the opening paragraphs  is as exhilarating as the challenge of life 's  opacities to a healthy curiosity .  Indeed the overall triumph of art in this case is that the novel walks out into our fact rather than ourselves entering its fiction :  a very primitive and absolute form of consumer capitulation .  Dostoevsky has an impudent way of making his narrator declare As a chronicler I confine myself to presenting events exactly as they happened , and it 's not my fault if they <head>appear</head> incredible like the son of the house writing home about his time on the North - West Frontier of India .

A single ma cannot divine fully the eternal and universal ideal ,  were he Shakespeare himself ,  ad therefore he cannot prescribe either the ways or the aims for art .  The Possessed  looked for a long time like losing its way ,  and Dostoevsky would surely concede that in so far as the design was ,  to use his own word ,  tendentious ,  this was bound to be so .  And yet a novel does n't write itself , even if some of the very greatest ones <head>appear</head> to ; it is written by a man with aims and preferences . But these just happen to be his ,  he ca n't prescribe them for art ;  what he wants to say must come to terms with what the form allows him ;  art refuses to be imposed upon ,  to be dictated to ,  and Dostoevsky 's  dictum will stand .

Non - corpuscular radiation is in the form of high energy X rays which ,  assuming that the earth is in the path of the rays ,  will reach the earth in fifteen minutes .  This radiation may increase the depth of the D layer due to ionisation and produce the all too well known Dellinger face out when long - distance HF communication ceases abruptly .  Corpuscular or particulate radiation <head>appears</head> in the form of protons and neutrons which take longer to reach the earth 's upper atmosphere than the higher energy radiations . These nuclear particles arrive at the F1 and F2 layers approximately 48 hours following a solar event and produce ionisation by colliding with gaseous molecules and cosmic particles .  This explains why so few protons are detectible at the earth 's  surface except after very major events .

A knowledge of the ionospheric status will often suggest which bands will be more productive .

Many articles have <head>appeared</head> in the amateur radio press and elsewhere describing the many aspects of propagation and giving more detailed information on the theory of and effects of solar radiation on communications systems . This brief and simplified introduction has been included for completeness ,  and hopefully to show that the examination of the earth 's  magnetosphere in relation to propagation is not a difficult project to undertake ,  the equipment is easy to build and has the advantage of being a both interesting and useful addition to your capability .

With regard to the debate about c  and Doppler shifts in the letters pages ,  light  ( velocity c  )  reflected or emitted from a surface moving with velocity v  towards an observer appears to be blue shifted ,  or red shifted in the case of a receding surface .  As a non - physicist I have often wondered if the difference in photon energy  (  E '  E = hf '  hf  )  of the shifted and unshifted light could be wholly accounted for by the effect of the surface velocity  (  v  )  acting together with the particle equivalent mass of the photon .  The extra energy not being allowed to be expressed as an increase in c <head>appears</head> as a commensurate increase in f , that is : ( formula included ) where m is the photon equivalent mass ( yes I know it is related to E but I am trying not to confuse myself ) , E is the energy , and h is Mr Plank 's claim to fame .

In view of the Warc footnote ,  this statement seems to have been economical with the truth .

I have attempted to take a rapid view of developments in critical theory , or criticism with a theoretical consciousness , as they have <head>appeared</head> in British culture in the past twenty years . There is an immediate contrast with the literary criticism and theory of the early twentieth century ,  in that most recent work begins and ends in the academy ,  and has little contact with current literary practice .  Both the New Criticism and Scrutiny  were products of the modernist literary revolution ,  and drew on it for their methods and their assumptions .
